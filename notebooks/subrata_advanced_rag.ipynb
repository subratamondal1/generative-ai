One early development of accounting dates back to ancient Mesopotamia and is closely related to developments in writing, counting and money; there is also evidence of early forms of bookkeeping in ancient Iran, and early auditing systems by the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians. By the time of Emperor Augustus, the Roman government had access to detailed financial information.\\nMany concepts related to today\\'s accounting seem to be initiated in medieval\\'s Middle East. For example, Jewish communities used double-entry bookkeeping in the early-medieval period and Muslim societies, at least since the 10th century also used many modern accounting concepts.\\nThe spread of the use of Arabic numerals, instead of the Roman numbers historically used in Europe, increased efficiency of accounting procedures among Mediterranean merchants, who further refined accounting in medieval Europe. With the development of joint-stock companies, accounting split into financial accounting and management accounting.\\nThe first published work on a double-entry bookkeeping system was the Summa de arithmetica, published in Italy in 1494 by Luca Pacioli (the \"Father of Accounting\"). Accounting began to transition into an organized profession in the nineteenth century, with local professional bodies in England merging to form the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1880.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\n\\nBoth the words \"accounting\" and \"accountancy\" were in use in Great Britain by the mid-1800s and are derived from the words accompting and accountantship used in the 18th century.

            "[Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 0}, page_content='CHAPTER 1 UNIT - 1  1.MEANING AND SCOPE OF ACCOUNTING 1.INTRODUCTION Every individual performs some kind of economic activity. A salaried person gets salary and spends to buy provisions and clothing, for children\\'s education, construction of house, etc. A sports club formed by a group of individuals, a business run by an individual or a group of individuals, a company running a business in telecom sector, a local authority like Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Delhi Development Authority, Governments, either Central or State, all are carrying some kind of economic activities. Not necessarily all the economic activities are run for any individual benefit; such economic activities may create social benefit i.e. benefit for the public, at large. Anyway, such economic activities are performed through \\'transactions and events\\'. Transaction is used to mean \\'a business, performance of an act, an agreement\\' while event is used to mean \\'a happening, as a consequence of transaction(s), a result.\\' 2.MEANING OF ACCOUNTING The Committee on Terminology set up by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants formulated the following definition of accounting in 1961: \"Accounting is the art of recording, classifying, and summarising in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of a financial character, and interpreting the result thereof.\" As per this definition, accounting is simply an art of record keeping. The process of accounting starts by first identifying the events and transactions which are of financial character and then be recorded in the books of account. Continuing with the same example of the telecom company, which needs to capture all'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='transactions (transactions made by the user, raising invoice to the customer, receipt of money, payment towards salaries, marketing etc.). Likewise, the individual running the stationery business, would need to record all business transactions. This recording is done in Journal or subsidiary books, also known as primary books. Every good record keeping system includes suitable classification of transactions and events as well as their summarisation for ready reference. For example, the telecom company performing thousands of transactions on a daily basis, is not expected to publish all those transactions for the users to be able to make a decision. Surely, those transactions need to be summarized appropriately. After the transactions and events are recorded, they are transferred to secondary books, i.e., Ledger. In ledger, transactions and events are classified in terms of income, expense, assets and liabilities according to their characteristics and summarised in profit and loss account and balance sheet. Essentially the transactions and events are to be measured in terms of money. Measurement in terms of money means measuring at the ruling currency of a country, for example, rupee in India, dollar in U.S.A. and like. The transactions and events must have at least in part, financial characteristics. The inauguration of a new branch of a bank is an event without having financial character, while the business disposed of by the branch is an event having financial character. Accounting also interprets the recorded, classified and summarized transactions and events. However, the above-mentioned definition does not reflect the present day accounting function. According to the above definition, accounting ends with interpretation of the results of the financial transactions and events but in the modern world with the diversification of management and ownership, globalization of business and society gaining more interest in the functioning of the enterprises, the importance of communicating the accounting results has increased. Therefore, this requirement of communicating and motivating informed judgement has also become the part of accounting as defined in the widely accepted definition of accounting, given by the American Accounting Association in 1966 which treated accounting as: \"The process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgments and decisions by the users of accounts.\" In 1970, the Accounting Principles Board (APB) of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) enumerated the functions of accounting as follows:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='\"The function of accounting is to provide quantitative information, primarily of financial nature, about economic entities, that is needed to be useful in making economic decisions.\" Thus, accounting may be defined as the process of recording, classifying, summarising, analysing and interpreting the financial transactions and communicating the results thereof to the persons interested in such information. The above definition requires accountants to assume a bigger responsibility than to merely do book-keeping. Accountants need to be ready to provide the information ready for the intended users to be able to make economic decisions. 2.1.Procedural aspects of Accounting On the basis of the above definitions, procedure of accounting can be basically divided into two parts: i.Generating financial information and ii.Using the financial information. Generating Financial Information 1.Recording - This is the basic function of accounting. All business transactions of a financial character, as evidenced by some documents such as sales bill, pass book, salary slip etc. are recorded in the books of account. Recording is done in a book called \"Journal.\" This book may further be divided into several subsidiary books according to the nature and size of the business. Students will learn how to prepare journal and various subsidiary books in chapter 2. 2.Classifying - Classification is concerned with the systematic analysis of the recorded data, with a view to group transactions or entries of one nature at one place so as to put information in compact and usable form. The book containing classified information is called \"Ledger\". This book contains on different pages, individual account heads under which, all financial transactions of similar nature are collected. For example, there may be separate account heads for Salaries, Rent, Printing and Stationeries, Advertisement etc. All expenses under these heads, after being recorded in the Journal, will be classified under separate heads in the Ledger. This will help in finding out the total expenditure incurred under each of the above heads. Students will learn how to prepare ledger books in chapter 2.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content=\"3.Summarising - It is concerned with the preparation and presentation of the classified data in a manner useful to the internal as well as the external users of financial statements. This process leads to the preparation of the financial statements. 4.Analysing - The term 'Analysis' means methodical classification of the data given in the financial statements. The figures given in the financial statements will not help anyone unless they are in a simplified form. For example, all items relating to fixed assets are put at one place while all items relating to current assets are put at another place. It is concerned with the establishment of relationship between the items of the Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet i.e. it provides the basis for interpretation. Students will learn this aspect of financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course. 5.Interpreting - This is the final function of accounting. It is concerned with explaining the meaning and significance of the relationship as established by the analysis of accounting data. The recorded financial data is analysed and interpreted in a manner that will enable the end-users to make a meaningful judgement about the financial condition and profitability of the business operations. The financial statement should explain not only what had happened but also why it happened and what is likely to happen under specified conditions. 6.Communicating - It is concerned with the transmission of summarised, analysed and interpreted information to the end-users to enable them to make rational decisions. This is done through preparation and distribution of accounting reports, which include besides the usual profit and loss account and the balance sheet, additional information in the form of accounting ratios, graphs, diagrams, fund flow statements etc. Students will learn this aspect of financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course. The first two procedural stages of the process of generating financial information along with the preparation of trial balance are covered under book-keeping while the preparation of financial statements and its analysis, interpretation and also its communication to the various users are considered as accounting stages. Students will learn the term book-keeping and its distinction with accounting, in the coming topics of this unit. Using the Financial Information There are certain users of accounts. Earlier it was viewed that accounting is meant for the proprietor or owner of the business, but changing social relationships diluted the earlier thinking. Since earlier businesses were simple and not scaled, probably that view could hold true for those.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content=\"It is now believed that besides the owner or the management of the business enterprise, users of accounts include the investors, employees, lenders, suppliers, customers, government and other agencies and the public at large. For example, if an airlines company borrows money from a bank, buys oil from oil companies, sells tickets to the customers, has staff to be paid salaries to, all these group of people and entities are key stakeholders in that airlines business. They would like to know and understand whether the business of the company is going well or there are challenges for the company to run the business. Accounting provides the art of presenting information systematically to the users of accounts. Accounting data is more useful if it stresses economic substance rather than technical form. Information is useless and meaningless unless it is relevant and material to a user's decision. The information should also be free of any biases. The users should understand not only the financial results depicted by the accounting figures, but also should be able to assess its reliability and compare it with information about alternative opportunities and the past experience. The owners or the management of the enterprise, commonly known as internal users, use the accounting information in an analytical manner to take the valuable decisions for the business. So the information served to them is presented in a manner different to the information presented to the external users. Even the small details which can affect the internal working of the business are given in the management report while financial statements presented to the external users contains key information regarding assets, liabilities and capital which are summarised in a logical manner that helps them in their respective decision-making. 3.EVOLUTION OF ACCOUNTING AS A SOCIAL SCIENCE History & Development of Accounting Accounting finds its roots as early as around 4000 BC, where Egyptians used some form of accounting for their treasuries. The in-charge of treasuries had to send day wise reports to their superiors known as Wazirs and monthly reports were sent to kings. Babylonia, known as the city of commerce, used accounting for business to identify the losses that took place due to frauds and lack of efficiency. Greece used accounting to divide the revenues received among treasuries, maintaining receipts, payments and balance of government financial transactions. Romans used memorandum or daybook where in receipts and payments were recorded. (700 B.C to 400 A.D). China used sophisticated form of government accounting as early as 2000 B.C. Accounting practices in India could be traced back to a period where, Kautilya, a\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content=\"minister in Chandragupta's kingdom wrote a book named Arthashasthra, which also described how accounting records had to be maintained. Luca Pacioli's, a  F r a n c i s c a n  f r i a r  ( m e r c h a n t  c l a s s ) ,  b o o k  S u m m a  d e  Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportion at Proportionality (Review of Arithmetic and Geometric proportions) in Venice (1494) is considered as the first book on double entry bookkeeping. A portion of this book contains knowledge of business and book-keeping. He used the terms Debit (Dr.) and Credit (Cr.) in his books. These were the concepts used in Italian terminology. Debit comes from the Italian debito which comes from the Latin debita and debeo which means owed to the proprietor. Credit comes from the Italian credito which comes from the Latin 'credo' which means trust or belief (in the proprietor or owed by the proprietor. In explaining double entry system, Pacioli wrote that 'All entries... have to be double entries, that is if you make one creditor, you must make some debtor'. He also mentioned that a merchant's responsibility is to give glory to God in their enterprises, to be ethical in all business activities and to earn a profit. He discussed the details of memorandum, journal, ledger and specialised accounting procedures. In its oldest form, accounting aided the stewards to discharge their stewardship function. The wealthy men employed stewards to manage their property; the stewards in turn rendered an account periodically of their stewardship. This 'Stewardship Accounting' was the root of financial accounting system. Although double-entry system was followed, 'stewardship accounting' served the purpose of businessmen and wealthy persons at that time. In most of the countries, stewardship accounting was prevalent till the emergence of large-scale enterprises in the form of public limited companies. In the second phase, the idea of financial accounting emerged with the concept of joint stock company and divorce of ownership from the management. To safeguard the interest of the shareholders and investors, disclosure of financial statements (mainly, profit and loss account and balance sheet) and other accounting information was moulded by law. Financial statements give periodic performance report by way of profit and loss account and financial position at the end of the period by way of Balance Sheet. It got the legal status due to changing relationships between the owners, economic entity and the managers. With the democratisation of society, the relationships between the enterprise on the one hand, the investors, employees, managers and governments on the other, have also undergone a seachange. Also, the prospective investors and other business contact groups want to know a lot about the business before entering into transactions. Thus, financial accounting emerged as an information system to identify, measure and communicate useful information for informed judgements and decisions by a broad group of users. In the third phase, accounting information was generated to aid management decision- making in particular. It contributed a lot to improve the quality of management decisions. This new\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content=\"dimension of accounting is called Management Accounting and it is the development of 20th Century only. It is pervasive enough to cover all spheres of management decisions. Lastly, Social Responsibility Accounting is in the formative process, which aims at accounting for the social cost incurred by business as well as the social benefit, created by it. It emerges from the growing social awareness about the undesirable by-products of economic activities. While earning profit, an enterprise incurs numerous social costs like pollution, using the resources of society like materials, land, labour etc. To compensate for this social cost, in today's world, an enterprise is expected to generate some social benefits also like employment opportunities, recreation activities, more choice to customers at reasonable price, better quality products etc. Therefore, it is demanded that the accounting system should produce a report measuring the social cost incurred and social benefits generated. Social Science study man as a member of society; they concern about social processes and the results and consequences of social relationships. The usefulness of accounting to society as a whole is the fundamental criterion to treat it as a social science. Although individuals may benefit from the availability of accounting information, the accounting system generates information for social good. It serves social purpose, it contributes for social progress; also it is being adapted to keep pace with social progress. So, accounting is treated as a social science. 4.OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING The objectives of accounting can be given as follows: 1.Systematic recording of transactions - Basic objective of accounting is to systematically record the financial aspects of business transactions, i.e., book-keeping. These recorded transactions are later on classified and summarized logically for the preparation of financial statements and for their analysis and interpretation. 2.Ascertainment of results of above recorded transactions - Accountant prepares profit and loss account to know the results of business operations for a particular period of time. If revenue (Sales) exceeds expenses then it is said that business is running profitably but if expenses exceed revenue, then it can be said that business is running under loss. The profit and loss account helps the management and different stakeholders in taking rational decisions. For example, if business is not proved to be remunerative or profitable, the cause of such a state of affair can be investigated by the management for taking remedial steps.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=\"3.Ascertainment of the financial position of the business - A businessman is not only interested in knowing the results of the business in terms of profits or loss for a particular period but is also anxious to know that what he owes (liability) to the outsiders and what he owns (assets) on a certain date. To know this, accountant prepares a financial position statement popularly known as Balance Sheet. The balance sheet is a statement of assets and liabilities of the business at a particular point of time and helps in ascertaining the financial health of the business. 4.Providing information to the users for rational decision-making - Accounting as a 'language of business' communicates the financial results of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. Accounting aims to meet the information needs of the decision-makers and helps them in rational decision-making. 5.To know the solvency position - By preparing the balance sheet, management not only reveals what is owned and owed by the enterprise, but also it gives the information regarding concern's ability to meet its liabilities in the short run (liquidity position) and also in the long-run (solvency position) as and when they fall due. An overview of objectives of accounting is depicted  below: Objectives of Accounting Accounting aims to fulfill several key objectives, which are essential for the proper management and financial transparency of a business or organization: 1.Systematic Recording of Transactions: The foundation of accounting is the methodical recording of all business transactions. This is achieved through the process of bookkeeping, which utilizes tools such as: Journal: A chronological record of all transactions. Ledger: A set of accounts where transactions are categorized. Trial Balance: A statement that ensures that the sum of debits equals the sum of credits, verifying the mathematical accuracy of the bookkeeping. 2.Ascertainment of Results: Accounting helps in determining the operational outcome of a business over a period, usually in terms of profit or loss. This is done through: Manufacturing Account: A statement showing the cost of production. Trading Account: A summary of the trading activities, showing the gross profit or loss.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Profit and Loss Account: An account that details the expenses and revenues, culminating in the net profit or loss. 3.Ascertainment of Financial Position: Through accounting, a business can determine its financial standing at a specific point in time. This objective is primarily achieved by preparing: Balance Sheet: A financial statement that lists assets, liabilities, and equity, depicting the financial position of the business. 4.Communicating Information to Various Users: Accounting serves to communicate financial information to a diverse set of users, which is crucial for decision-making. The information is disseminated through: Financial Reports: Documents such as income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and equity statements that provide detailed financial information to stakeholders. These objectives are integral to the discipline of accounting, ensuring that all financial information is recorded accurately, results are clearly ascertained, financial positions are transparent, and information is effectively communicated to all relevant stakeholders. 5.FUNCTIONS OF ACCOUNTING The main functions of accounting are as follows: a)Measurement: Accounting measures past performance of the business entity and depicts its current financial position. b)Forecasting: Accounting helps in forecasting future performance and financial position of the enterprise using past data and analysing trends. c)Decision-making: Accounting provides relevant information to the users of accounts to aid rational decision-making. d)Comparison & Evaluation: Accounting assesses performance achieved in relation to targets and discloses information regarding accounting policies and contingent liabilities which play an important role in predicting, comparing and evaluating the financial results. e)Control: Accounting also identifies weaknesses of the operational system and provides feedbacks regarding effectiveness of measures adopted to check such weaknesses. f)Government Regulation and Taxation: Accounting provides necessary information to the government to exercise control on the entity as well as in collection of tax revenues.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content=\"6.BOOK-KEEPING Book-keeping is an activity concerned with the recording of financial data relating to business operations in a significant and orderly manner. It covers procedural aspects of accounting work and embraces record keeping function. Obviously, book-keeping procedures are governed by the end product, the financial statements. The term 'financial statements' means Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet and cash flow statements including Schedules and Notes forming part of Accounts. Book-keeping also requires suitable classification of transactions and events. This is also determined with reference to the requirement of financial statements. A book-keeper may be responsible for keeping all the records of a business or only of a minor segment, such as position of the customers' accounts in a departmental store. Accounting is based on a careful and efficient book-keeping system. The essential idea behind maintaining book-keeping records is to show correct position regarding each head of income and expenditure. A business may purchase goods on credit as well as in cash. When the goods are bought on credit, a record must be kept of the person to whom money is owed. The proprietor of the business may like to know, from time to time, what amount is due on credit purchase and to whom. If proper record is not maintained, it is not possible to get details of the transactions in regard to the income and expenses. At the end of the accounting period, the proprietor wants to know how much profit has been earned or loss has been incurred during the course of the period. For this lot of information is needed which can be gathered from a proper record of the transactions. Therefore, in book-keeping, the proper maintenance of books of account is indispensable for any business. At this level, the major concern of the curriculum is with book-keeping and preparation of financial statements. It seems important to mention at this point that book-keeping and preparation of financial statements have legal implications also. Maintenance of books of accounts and the preparation of financial statements of a company are guided by the Companies Act, banks and insurance companies by special Acts governing these institutions and so on. However, for sole-proprietorship and partnership business, there is no specific legislation regarding maintenance of books of accounts and preparation of financial statements. 6.1.Objectives of Book-keeping 1.Complete Recording of Transactions - It is concerned with complete and permanent record of all transactions in a systematic and logical manner to show its financial effect on the business.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='2.Ascertainment of financial Effect on the Business - It is concerned with the combined effect of all the transactions made during the accounting period upon the financial position of the business as a whole. 7.DISTINCTION BETWEEN BOOK-KEEPING AND ACCOUNTING Some people mistake book-keeping and accounting to be synonymous terms, but in fact they are different from each other. Accounting is a broad subject. It calls for a greater understanding of records obtained from book-keeping and an ability to analyse and interpret the information provided by book-keeping records. Book-keeping is the recording phase while accounting is concerned with the summarising phase of an accounting system. Book-keeping provides necessary data for accounting and accounting starts where book-keeping ends. Book-keeping: This is a process primarily concerned with the systematic recording of financial transactions. Accounting: This process entails summarizing and interpreting the transactions that have been recorded during book-keeping. 1.Book-keeping: It lays the foundation for the accounting process. Accounting: It acts as a comprehensive language that communicates the financial health and performance of a business. 2.Book-keeping: The creation of financial statements is not a function of book-keeping. Accounting: Financial statements are generated within this process, utilizing the initial records from book-keeping. 3.Book-keeping: It does not provide the necessary information for managerial decision-making. Accounting: It enables management to make informed decisions based on the analysis of book-keeping records. 4.Book-keeping: This field does not extend into specialized sub-categories. Accounting: It encompasses various sub-disciplines, such as financial accounting and management accounting. 5.Book-keeping: The financial position of a business cannot be deduced solely from book-keeping records. Accounting: It allows for the determination of the financial position through detailed accounting reports derived from book-keeping data. This comparative outline clarifies the distinct roles and contributions of book-keeping and accounting within the financial recording and reporting processes of a business.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content=\"Relationship of Accounting and Book-keeping can be depicted in the following chart as The Hierarchy of Financial Recording and Reporting The field of financial management is structured into distinct yet interrelated layers, each building upon the foundational practices of the previous one. This hierarchy can be visualized as: 1)Accountancy: This is the broadest category within this financial hierarchy. It encompasses all the activities related to the management of financial information, including the processes of accounting and bookkeeping, along with the analytical tasks that inform strategic decision-making. 2)Accounting: Nested within accountancy, accounting refers to the systematic process of recording, summarizing, and reporting the financial transactions of a business. It provides a comprehensive view of the financial activities through the creation of various financial statements and reports. 3)Bookkeeping: At the core of this hierarchy lies bookkeeping, which is a subset of accounting. It is the initial phase of the accounting process, focusing on the meticulous and detailed recording of each financial transaction in chronological order. Bookkeeping is essential for providing the raw financial data that will be further analyzed and interpreted in the accounting process. In essence, bookkeeping serves as the groundwork for accounting, which in turn is a critical component of the broader discipline of accountancy. Each level in this hierarchy is crucial for the accurate and effective management of a business's financial information. 8.SUB-FIELDS OF ACCOUNTING The various sub-fields of accounting are: i.Financial Accounting - It covers the preparation and interpretation of financial statements and communication to the users of accounts. It is historical in nature as it records transactions which had already been occurred. The final step of financial accounting is the preparation of Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet. It primarily helps in determination of the net result for an accounting period and the financial position as on the given date. ii.Management Accounting - It is concerned with internal reporting to the managers of a business unit. To discharge the functions of stewardship, planning, control and decision- making, the management needs variety of information. The different ways of grouping information and preparing reports as desired by managers for discharging their functions are referred to as management accounting. A very important component of the management accounting is cost accounting which deals with cost ascertainment and cost\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='control. Management Accounting will be dealt with at higher levels of the Chartered Accountancy Course. iii.Cost Accounting - The terminology of Cost Accounting published by the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of England defines cost accounting as: \"the process of accounting for cost which begins with the recording of income and expenditure or the bases on which they are calculated and ends with the preparation of periodical statements and reports for ascertaining and controlling costs.\" iv.Social Responsibility Accounting - The demand for social responsibility accounting stems from increasing social awareness about the undesirable by-products of economic activities. As already discussed earlier, social responsibility accounting is concerned with accounting for social costs incurred by the enterprise and social benefits created. v.Human Resource Accounting - Human resource accounting is an attempt to identify, quantify and report investments made in human resources of an organisation that are not presently accounted for under conventional accounting practice. 9.USERS OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION Generally users of accounts are classified into two categories, (a) internal users and (b) external users. Management accounting is concerned with identifying information requirements as well as methods of providing such information to management while information requirements of the outside users are generally served by financial statements. Following are the various users of accounting information: i.Investors: They provide risk capital to the business. They need information to assess whether to buy, hold or sell their investment. Also they are interested to know the ability of the business to survive, prosper and to pay dividend. In non-corporate sector, where ownership and management are not essentially separated, the owners still need information about performance of the business and its financial position to decide whether to continue or shut down. ii.Employees: Growth of the employees is directly related to the growth of the organisation and therefore, they are interested to know the stability, continuity and growth of the enterprise and its ability to provide remuneration, retirement and other benefits and to enhance employment opportunities.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content=\"iii.Lenders: They are interested to know whether their loan-principal and interest will be paid back when due. iv.Suppliers and Creditors: They are also interested to know the ability of the enterprise to pay their dues, that helps them to decide the credit policy for the relevant concern, rates to be charged and so on. Sometimes, they also become interested in long-term continuation of the enterprise if their existence becomes dependent on the survival of that business. v.Customers: Customers are also concerned with the stability and profitability of the enterprise because their functioning is more or less dependent on the supply of goods, suppose, a company produces some chemicals used by pharmaceutical companies and supplies chemicals on three month's credit. If all of a sudden it faces some trouble and is unable to supply the chemical, the customers will also be in trouble. vi.Government and their agencies: They regulate the functioning of business enterprises for public good, allocate scarce resources among competing enterprises, control prices, charge excise duties and taxes, and so they have continued interest in the business enterprise. vii.Public: The public at large is interested in the functioning of the enterprise because it may make a substantial contribution to the local economy in many ways including the number of people employed and their patronage to local suppliers. viii.Management: Management as whole is also interested in the accounts for various managerial decisions. On the basis of the accounts, management determines the effects of their various decisions on the functioning of the organisation. This helps them to make further managerial decisions. 1.10 RELATIONSHIP OF ACCOUNTING WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES Accounting is closely related with several other disciplines and thus to acquire a good knowledge in accounting one should be conversant with the relevant portions of such disciplines. In many cases they overlap accounting. The accountant should have a working knowledge of the related disciplines so that he can understand such overlapping areas and apply the knowledge of other disciplines in his own work wherever possible, or he can take the expert advice. a)Accounting and Economics: Economics is viewed as a science of rational decisionmaking about the use of scarce resources. It is concerned with the analysis of efficient use of scarce resources for satisfying human wants. This may be viewed either from the perspective of a single firm or of the country as a whole.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content=\"Accounting is viewed as a system, which provides data to the users to permit informed judgement and decisions. Some non-accounting data are also relevant for decisionmaking. Accounting overlaps economics in many respects. It contributed a lot in improving the management decision-making process. But, economic theories influenced the development of the decision-making tools used in accounting. However, there exists a wide gulf between economists' and accountants' concepts of income and capital. Accountants got the ideas of value, income and capital maintenance from economists, but brushed suitably to make them usable in practical circumstances. Accountants developed the valuation, measurement and decisionmaking techniques which may owe to the economic theorems for origin but these are moulded in the work environment and suitably tempered with reference to relevance, verifiability, freedom from bias, timeliness, comparability, reliability and understandability. An example may be given to explain the nexus between accounting and economics. Economists think that value of an asset is the present value of all future earnings which can be derived from such assets. Now think about a plant whose working life is more than one hundred years. How can you estimate future stream of earnings? So accountants developed the workable valuation base - the acquisition cost i.e., the price paid to acquire the assets. At the macro-level, accounting provides the database over which the economic decision models have been developed; micro-level data arranged by the accounting system is summed up to get macro-level database. Non-overlapping zones of accounting are not negligible. Development of the systems of recording, classifying and summarising transactions and events, harmonising the systems by uniform rules and communicating the data is essentially a non-overlapping area of accounting. b)Accounting and Statistics: The use of statistics in accounting can be appreciated better in the context of the nature of accounting records. Accounting information is very precise; it is exact to the last paisa. But, for decision-making purposes such precision is not necessary and hence, the statistical approximations are sought. In accounts, all values are important individually because they relate to business transactions. As against this, statistics is concerned with the typical value, behaviour or trend over a period of time or the degree of variation over a series of observations. Therefore, wherever a need arises for only broad generalisations or the average of relationships, statistical methods have to be applied in accounting data.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content=\"Further, in accountancy, the classification of assets and liabilities as well as the heads of income and expenditure has been done as per the needs of financial recording to ascertain financial results of various operations. Other types of classification like the geographical and historical ones and ad hoc classification are done depending on the purpose to make such classification meaningful. Accounting records generally take a short-term view of events and are confined to a year while statistical analysis is more useful if a longer view is taken for the purpose. For example, to fit the trend line a longer period will be required. However, statistical methods do use past accounting records maintained on a consistent basis. The functional relations showing mathematical relations of one variable with one or more other variables are based on statistical work. These relations are used widely in making cost or price estimates for some estimated future values assigned to the given independent variables. For example, given the functional relation of total cost to the price of an input, the effect of changes in future prices on the cost of production can be calculated. In accountancy, a number of financial and other ratios are based on statistical methods, which help in averaging them over a period of time. Several accounting and financial calculations are based on statistical formulae. Statistical methods are helpful in developing accounting data and in their interpretation. For example, time series and cross-sectional comparison of accounting data is based on statistical techniques. Now- a-days multiple discriminate analysis is popularly used to identify symptoms of sickness of a business firm. Therefore, the study and application of statistical methods would add extra edge to the accounting data. c)Accounting and Mathematics: Double Entry book-keeping can be converted in algebraic form; in fact the first known book on this subject was part of a treatise on algebra. The fundamental accounting equation will be discussed in detail under 'Dual Aspect Concept' of this chapter. Knowledge of arithmetic and algebra is a pre-requisite for accounting computations and measurements. Calculations of interest and annuity are the examples of such fundamental uses. While computing depreciation, finding out installments in hirepurchase and instalments payment transactions, calculating amount to be set aside for repayment of loan and replacement of assets and calculating lease rentals, mathematical techniques are frequently used. Accounting data are also presented in ratio form. With the advent of the computer, mathematics is becoming a vital part of accounting. Instead of writing accounts in traditional fashion, the transactions and events can be recorded in the matrix form and the rules of matrix algebra can be applied for classifying and summarising data.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='Now-a-days statistics and econometric models are largely used for developing decision models for the users of accounts. Also, Operations Research Techniques provide lot of decision models. Since accounting is meant for providing information to the users, to be effective, accounting data should feed the information requirements of such statistical, econometric and operations research models. Understanding mathematics has become a must to grasp the decision models framed by statisticians, econometricians and the O.R. experts. Presently graphs and charts are being extensively used for communicating accounting information. In addition to statistical knowledge, knowledge in geometry and trigonometry seems to be essential to have a better understanding about the accounting communications system. d)Accounting and Law: An economic entity operates within a legal environment. All transactions with suppliers and customers are governed by the Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act, the Negotiable Instruments Act, etc. The entity itself is created and controlled by laws. For example, a company is created by the Companies Act and also controlled by Companies Act. Similarly, every country has a set of economic, fiscal and labour laws. Transactions and events are always guided by laws of the land. Very often the accounting system to be followed has been prescribed by the law. For example, the Companies Act has prescribed the format of financial statements for companies. Banking, insurance and electric supply undertakings may also have to produce financial statements as prescribed by the respective legislations controlling such entities. However, legal prescription about the accounting system is the product of developments in accounting knowledge. That is to say, legislation about accounting system cannot be enacted unless there is a corresponding development in the accounting discipline. In that way accounting influences law and is also influenced by law. e)Accounting and Management: Management is a broad occupational field, which comprises many functions and encompasses application of many disciplines including those mentioned above. Accountants are well placed in the management and play a key role in the management team. A large portion of accounting information is prepared for management decision-making. Although management relies on other data sources, accounting data are used as basic source documents. In the management team, an accountant is in a better position to understand and use such data. In other words, since an accountant plays an active role in management, he understands the data requirements. So the accounting system can be moulded to serve the management purpose.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content=\"10.LIMITATIONS OF ACCOUNTING There are certain misconceptions regarding financial statements. A common man presumes that an income statement shows the correct income or loss of the enterprise and that a balance sheet depicts a perfectly true and fair picture of financial standing of that enterprise. It must be recognised that the accounting as a language has its own limitations. The figures of profit or loss generated by the accounting process are subject to various constraints within which the accounting works. The assumptions and conventions, on which the accounting is based, become the limitations of accounting. The financial statements are never free from subjectivity factor as these are largely the outcome of personal judgement of the accountant with regard to the adoption of the accounting policies. Following are certain instances: 1.The factors which may be relevant in assessing the worth of the enterprise don't find place in the accounts as they cannot be measured in terms of money. The Balance sheet cannot reflect the value of certain factors like loyalty and skill of the personnel which may be the most valuable asset of an enterprise these days. 2.Balance Sheet shows the position of the business on the day of its preparation and not on the future date while the users of the accounts are interested in knowing the position of the business in the near future and also in long run and not for the past date. 3.Accounting ignores changes in some money factors like inflation etc. 4.There are occasion when accounting principles conflict with each other. 5.Certain accounting estimates depend on the sheer personal judgement of the accountant, e.g., provision for doubtful debts, method of depreciation adopted, recording certain expenditure as revenue expenditure or capital expenditure, selection of method of valuation of inventories and the list is quite long. 6.Financial statements consider those assets which can be expressed in monetary terms. Human resources although the very important asset of the enterprise are not shown in the balance sheet. There is no generally accepted formula for the valuation of human resources in money terms. 7.Different accounting policies for the treatment of same item adds to the probability of manipulations. Though through various laws and Accounting Standards, efforts are made to reduce these options to minimum but certainly could not be reduced to one. In nutshell, it can be said that the language of accounting has certain\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='practical limitations and, therefore, the financial statements should be interpreted carefully keeping in mind all various factors influencing the true picture. 11.ROLE OF ACCOUNTANT IN THE SOCIETY There are only a few types of profession in the world which are held in high esteem in public eyes and there is no denying the fact that the accounting profession is one of them. Goethe had called the accountant’s profession as ‘the fairest invention of the human mind’. At the core of all types of learned profession, there is the desire of public good and of finding the best way to serve society. By the use of the science of accountancy and under the spell of its art, a dynamic pattern which assists business in planning its future is woven by accountants out of the inert mass of non-speaking silent figures. This is what makes their profession an instrument of socio-economic change and welfare of the society. An accountant with his education, training, analytical mind and experience is best qualified to provide multiple need-based services to the ever growing society. The accountants of today can do full justice not only to matters relating to taxation, costing, management accounting, financial lay-out, company legislation and procedures but they can delve deep into the fields relating to financial policies, budgetary policies and even economic principles. The area of activities which can be undertaken by the accountants is not limited but it can also cover many additional facets. 1.12.1 Areas of Service The practice of accountancy has crossed its usual domain of preparation of financial statements, interpretation of such statements and audit thereof. Accountants are presently taking active role in company laws and other corporate legislation matters, in taxation laws matters (both direct and indirect) and in general management problems. Some of the services rendered by accountants to the society are briefly mentioned hereunder: i.Maintenance of Books of Accounts: An accountant is able to maintain a systematic record of financial transactions in order to establish the net result of the transactions entered into during a period and to state the financial position of the concern as at a particular date. For the fulfillment of the twin objective of ascertaining the profit earned or loss suffered and the financial position, it is necessary that all transactions be recorded in a systematic manner, which can be done only by an accountant. Proper maintenance of books of accounts assists management in planning, decision-making, controlling functions.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='ii.Statutory Audit: Every limited company is required to appoint a chartered accountant or a firm of chartered accountants as their auditor who are statutorily required to report each year whether in their opinion the balance sheet shows a true and fair view of the state of affairs on the balance sheet date, and the profit and loss account shows a true and fair view of the profit or loss for the year. Auditing is not confined to the accounts of companies; other organisations may also have their accounts audited, either because the law so requires (for example, the Co-operative Societies Act, the Income-tax Act, etc.) or because the proprietors wisely decided so (for example, a partnership firm or an individual trader). iii.Internal Audit: It is a management tool whereby an internal auditor thoroughly examines the accounting transactions and also the system, according to which these have been recorded with a view to ensure the management that the accounts are being properly maintained and the system contains adequate safeguards to check any leakage of revenue or misappropriation of property or assets and the operations have been carried out in conformity with the plans of management. Now-a-days internal auditing has developed as a service to management. The internal auditor constructively contributes in improving the operational efficiency of the business through an independent review and appraisal of all business operations. iv.Taxation: An accountant can handle taxation matters of a business or a person and he can represent that business or person before the tax authorities and settle the tax liability under the statute prevailing. He can also assist in avoiding or reducing tax burden by proper planning of tax affairs. Accountants also have a social obligation to express their views on broad tax policy, on the effect of tax rate on business and the economy in general and on all other aspects of taxation in which they have knowledge superior to that of the general public. v.Management Accounting and Consultancy Services: Management accountant performs an advisory function. He is largely responsible for internal reporting to the management for planning and controlling current operations, decision-making on special matters and for formulating long-range plans. His job is to collect, analyse, interpret and present all accounting information which is useful to the management. Accountant provides management consultancy services in the areas of management information system, expenditure control and evaluation of appraisal techniques for new investments and divestments, working capital management, corporate planning etc.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='vi.Financial Advice: Many people need help and guidance in planning their personal financial affairs. An accountant who knows about finances, taxation and family problems is well placed to give such advice. Some of the areas in which an accountant can render financial advice are: a)Investments: An accountant can explain the significance of the formidable documents which shareholders receive from companies and help in making decisions relating to their investments. b)Insurance: An accountant can provide information to his clients on various insurance policies and helps in choosing appropriate policy. c)Business Expansion: As businesses grow in size and complexity and mergers are being considered, accountants are in the forefront in interpreting accounts, making suggestions as to the form of schemes and the fairness of proposals considering cost and financial consequences and generally advising their clients. They also advise on how to set about the problem of borrowing money or whether this is an appropriate method of finance. Accountants can render extremely useful service in connection of negotiations with foreign collaborators. d)Investigations: Financial investigations are required for a variety of purposes. Examples are: i.To ascertain the financial position of a business, for the information of interested parties in connection with an issue of capital, the purchase or sale of the business or a reconstruction or amalgamation. ii.To help the management to decide whether it is cheaper to manufacture an article or to buy out. iii.To ascertain why profits have fallen. iv.To achieve greater efficiency in management. v.To ascertain whether fraud has occurred and if so, its nature and extent and to make suggestions which will help to prevent a recurrence. vi.To value businesses and shares in private companies for purposes such as purchase, sale, estate duty or wealth tax etc. For such problems requiring financial investigation, you need an accountant. His task as an independent professional is to establish the facts fairly and clearly for the benefit of those who have to make decisions and to give advice in many areas in which he has competence and experience. e)Pension schemes: Specialist advice from actuaries, insurance agents or insurance company is needed before launching or amending a provident fund'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content=\"or pension scheme in a business. But before making a final decision, an accountant has to be consulted. Later on, his help may be needed for managing the scheme or obtaining tax relief. vii.Other Services a)Secretarial Work: Companies, clubs, and associations indeed, virtually all organisations involve secretarial work. Accountants frequently do this work. b)Share Registration Work: Accountants are often used by many companies to undertake the work involved in registering share transfers and new issues. c)Company Formation: In conjunction with legal advisers, accountants help in the formation of a company or advise against doing so. d)Receiverships, Liquidations, etc.: An accountant has to sometimes take on the onerous duties of liquidator when a company is being wound up or receiver when a debenture holder exercises a right to recover a loan on which the borrower has defaulted. Accountant is just the man for the job. He is also just the man to help you to keep insolvency away if you consult him in time. e)Arbitrations: At times, accountants are invited by parties to act as arbitrators in a dispute or settle disputes of various kinds. f)As regards the Cost Accounts: A cost accountant's job is to continuously report cost data and related information at frequent intervals to the management. (g) Accountant and Information Services: An accountant will be effective in his role if he supplies the information promptly and in an unambiguous language. He should develop a system by which there is a regular flow of information both horizontally and vertically. The information system should be such that comparability of financial statement is possible both business-wise and year-wise so that it benefits both the management and the investors. Dependence on data from the computerised information system will put new responsibilities on an accountant but his product will command greater attention and respect. 1.12.2 Chartered Accountant in Industry An accountant, though he is a part of the highest planning team is not a planner in an industry. He works with the functional departments and translates the organisation's aims in terms of financial expectations. Therefore, he has to make a thorough study of the business and of individuals in the functional departments, whether they are engineers or salesmen. A qualified accountant will be able to play an important role in performing important functions of a business relating to accounting, costing and budgetary control, estimating and treasury.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='1.12.3 Chartered Accountant in Public Sector Enterprises Both in the developed and developing countries, public sector enterprises have become a special feature of the national economy. The system of financial and budgetary control and of accounting, auditing and reporting has, therefore, become a matter of interest and concern to the nation, and does not remain confined merely to a limited number of shareholders. The form of accounting followed by these corporations or companies is different from that of ordinary government accounting. It is the duty of the accountants to prepare the accounts and reports of these public corporations in such a way that they enable the general public to know how far the items appearing in the various types of records and financial statements justify their existence. 1.12.4 Chartered Accountant in Framing Fiscal Policies Accountants have a positive role to play in the determination of proper fiscal policies and advancement of trade, commerce and industry. They should develop new techniques and prepare themselves for new fields of service towards their commitment to the concept of the public goods and services. A business enterprise can be successful in the commercial sense only if accounting and business knowledge are pooled together. It is a social obligation for both accountants in industry and in practice to disclose greater information regarding the corporate results. The state of affairs of the economy can be ascertained only when such consolidated corporate information is disclosed. 1.12.5 Chartered Accountant and Economic Growth In the present times accountants should conceive their duties as broadly as the conditions might require and do not restrict them to only literal compliance of the law. Their aim should be not to allow any individual to gain at the cost of the nation. Accountants have to accept a positive role and do their best to encourage efficiency in individual business units and encourage those social objectives which form the main foundation of a welfare state.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='UNIT - 2  2. ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES AND CONVENTIONS Fundamental Accounting Concepts and Conventions Accounting is governed by a set of underlying principles and conventions that ensure uniformity, reliability, and comparability of financial statements. These include: 1.Entity Concept: This principle dictates that the business is treated as a separate entity from its owners or other businesses, with its own set of financial records. 2.Money Measurement Concept: According to this convention, only transactions that can be measured in monetary terms are recorded in the accounting books. 3.Periodicity Concept: This concept facilitates the division of the continuous life of an enterprise into periodic intervals, usually a year, to produce financial reports. 4.Accrual Concept: This principle states that income and expenses are recognized when they are earned or incurred, not necessarily when the cash is received or paid.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='5.Matching Concept: This concept advises that expenses should be matched with revenues in the period in which the revenue was earned, leading to an accurate calculation of profit or loss. 6.Going Concern Concept: When preparing financial statements, it is assumed that the business will continue to operate and will not be forced to halt operations or liquidate assets. 7.Cost Concept: This convention maintains that all assets are recorded in the books of accounts at their purchase price, which includes cost of acquisition, transportation, and installation and not their market price. 8.Realisation Concept: Revenue is recognized at the point when it is earned and is measurable, regardless of when cash is received. 9.Dual Aspect Concept: This fundamental principle of accounting states that every transaction has a dual effect on the financial position of the business, represented by the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity. 10.Conservatism: This convention suggests a degree of caution in the face of uncertainty, typically by recognizing expenses and liabilities as soon as possible when there is uncertainty about the outcome, but only recognizing revenues and assets when they are assured of being received. 11.Consistency: This principle states that once an accounting method has been chosen, it should be used consistently from one period to another to ensure comparability of financial statements over time. 12.Materiality: This concept implies that all significant items, the knowledge of which might influence the decision of a user of the financial statements, should be properly reported. These concepts and conventions form the bedrock of financial accounting, ensuring that the financial statements present a true and fair view of the financial performance and position of the business. 2.1.INTRODUCTION Let us imagine a situation where you are a proprietor and you take copies of your books of account to five different accountants. You ask them to prepare the financial statements on the basis of the above records and to calculate the profits of the business for the year. After few days, they are ready with the financial statements and all the five accountants have calculated five different amounts of profits and that too with very wide variations among them. Guess in such a situation what impact would it leave on you about accounting profession. To avoid this, a generally accepted set of rules have been developed. This generally accepted set of rules provides unity of understanding and unity of approach in'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content=\"the practice of accounting and also in better preparation and presentation of the financial statements. Accounting is a language of the business. Financial statements prepared by the accountant communicate financial information to the various stakeholders for decision-making purpose. Therefore, it is important that financial statements prepared by different organizations should be prepared on uniform basis. Also, there should be consistency over a period of time in the preparation of these financial statements. If every accountant starts following his own norms and notions for accounting of different items, then there will be an utter confusion. To avoid confusion and to achieve uniformity, accounting process is applied within the conceptual framework of 'Generally Accepted Accounting Principles'(GAAPs). The term GAAPs is used to describe rules developed for the preparation of the financial statements and are called concepts, conventions, postulates, principles etc. These GAAPs are the backbone of the accounting information system, without which the whole system cannot even stand erectly. These principles are the ground rules, which define the parameters and constraints within which accounting reports are generated. Accounting principles are basic norms and assumptions on which the whole accounting system has been developed and established. Accountant also adheres to various accounting standards issued by the regulatory authority for the standardization of accounting policies to be followed under specific circumstances. These conceptual frameworks, GAAPs and accounting standards are considered as the theory base of accounting. Globally, for achieving the standardization, countries use the framework under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, countries may apply their respective GAAPs and related conceptual frameworks. For example, in India, companies are required to use AS or Ind-AS frameworks as applicable. 2.2.ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS Accounting concepts define the assumptions on the basis of which financial statements of a business entity are prepared. Certain concepts are perceived, assumed and accepted in accounting to provide a unifying structure and internal logic to accounting process. The word concept means idea or notion, which has universal application. Financial transactions are interpreted in the light of the concepts, which govern accounting methods. Concepts are those basic assumptions and conditions, which form the basis upon which the accountancy has been laid. Unlike physical science, accounting concepts are only result of broad consensus. These accounting concepts lay the foundation on the basis of which the accounting principles are formulated. 2.3.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='\"Accounting principles are a body of doctrines commonly associated with the theory and procedures of accounting serving as an explanation of current practices and as a guide for selection of conventions or procedures where alternatives exist.\" Accounting principles must satisfy the following conditions: 1.They should be based on real assumptions; 2.They must be simple, understandable and explanatory; 3.They must be followed consistently; 4.They should be able to reflect future predictions; 5.They should be informational for the users. 2.4.ACCOUNTING CONVENTIONS Accounting conventions emerge out of accounting practices, commonly known as accounting principles, adopted by various organizations over a period of time. These conventions are derived by usage and practice. The accountancy bodies of the world may change any of the convention to improve the quality of accounting information. Accounting conventions need not have universal application. In the study material, the terms \\'accounting concepts\\', \\'accounting principles\\' and \\'accounting conventions\\' have been used interchangeably to mean those basic points of agreement on which financial accounting theory and practice are founded. 2.5.CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES AND CONVENTIONS - AN OVERVIEW Now we shall study in detail the various accounting concepts on which accounting is based. The following are the widely accepted accounting concepts: a)Entity concept: Entity concept states that business enterprise is a separate identity apart from its owner. Accountants should treat a business as distinct from its owner. Business transactions are recorded in the business books of accounts and owner\\'s transactions in his personal books of accounts. The practice of distinguishing the affairs of the business from the personal affairs of the owners originated only in the early days of the doubleentry book-keeping. This concept helps in keeping business affairs free from the influence of the personal affairs of the owner. This basic concept is applied to all the organizations whether sole proprietorship or partnership or corporate entities. Entity concept keeps the business separate from its owner. In a way, the entity concept helps to ascertain how much amount of money is due to the owner in'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content=\"form of his capital and share of profits earned. It also helps to perform accounting from the point of view of the business and not that of the owner. For example, if a person runs a business and pays money from his own pocket for his son's school fee, it will not constitute a transaction in the books of the business. However, if the person withdraws money from the business to pay for his son's school fee it will constitute a transaction to be recorded in the books of the business as amount withdrawn by the owner. Entity concept means that the enterprise is liable to the owner for capital investment made by the owner. Since the owner invested capital, which is also called risk capital, he has claim on the profit of the enterprise. A portion of profit which is apportioned to the owner and is immediately payable becomes current liability in the case of corporate entities. b)Money measurement concept: As per this concept, only those transactions, which can be measuredin terms of money are recorded. Since money is the medium of exchange and the standard of economic value, this concept requires that those transactions alone that are capable of being measured in terms of money be only to be recorded in the books of accounts. Transactions, even if, they affect the results of the business materially, are not recorded if they are not convertible in monetary terms. For example, a business owning a factory on a piece of 1 acre of land, with an office building with 2 floors, having 20 computers, and 10 units of machine cannot show these items under different measurement units. These items need to be expressed in monetary terms. The factory price might be , cost of land might be , building with a cost of , computers at a cost of 10 lac and machines with a cost of  need to be recorded. However, the concept has its own limitations. Transactions and events that cannot be expressed in terms of money are not recorded in the business books. For example; employees of the organization are, no doubt, the assets of the organizations but their measurement in monetary terms is not possible therefore, not included in the books of account of the organization. Measuring unit for money is taken as the currency of the ruling country i.e., the ruling currency of a country provides a common denomination for the value of material objects. It may be mentioned that when transactions occur across the boundary of a country, one may see many currencies. Suppose a businessman sells goods worth ₹ 50 lakhs at home and he also sells goods worth of 1 lakh Euro in the United States. What is his total sales? ₹ 50 lakhs plus 1 lakh Euro. These are not amenable to even arithmetic treatment. So, transactions are to be recorded at uniform monetary unit i.e. in one currency. Suppose EURO 1 = ₹ 71 . 50Cr30Cr15Cr10Cr\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content=\"Total Sales  lakhs plus 71 lakhs  lakhs. Money Measurement Concept imparts the essential flexibility for measurement and interpretation of accounting data. This concept ignores that money is an inelastic yardstick for measurement as it is based on the implicit assumption that purchasing power of the money is not of sufficient importance as to require adjustment. For example, a unit of land purchased 10 years ago for  and a similar unit of land purchased now for  will still be shown at the respective values, i.e., total of . Though in real world, the true value of the units together might be . Accordingly, accounting does not give a true and fair view of the affairs of the business. As mentioned earlier, many material transactions and events are not recorded in the books of accounts just because they cannot be measured in monetary terms. Yet it is used for accounting purposes because it is not possible to adopt a better measurement scale. Entity and money measurement are viewed as the basic concepts on which other procedural concepts hinge. c)Periodicity concept: T h i s  i s  a l s o  c a l l e d  t h e  c o n c e p t  o f  d e f i n i t e  accounting period. As per going concern' concept an indefinite life of the entity is assumed. For a business entity it causes inconvenience to measure performance achieved by the entity in the ordinary course of business. If a textile mill lasts for 100 years, it is not desirable to measure its performance as well as financial position only at the end of its life. So, a small but workable fraction of time is chosen out of infinite life cycle of the business entity for measuring performance and looking at the financial position. Generally, one year period is taken up for performance measurement and appraisal of financial position. However, it may also be 6 months or 9 months or 15 months. According to this concept accounts should be prepared after every period & not at the end of the life of the entity. Usually, this period is one calendar year. We generally follow from 1st April of a year to 31st March of the immediately following year. Thus, for performance appraisal it is not necessary to look into the revenue and expenses of an unduly long time-frame. This concept makes the accounting system workable and the term 'accrual' meaningful. If one thinks of indefinite time-frame, nothing will accrue. There cannot be unpaid expenses and non- receipt of revenue. Accrued expenses or accrued revenue is only with reference to a finite time-frame which is called accounting period. =₹50=₹12140Cr90Cr130Cr180Cr(90+90)\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content=\"Thus, the periodicity concept facilitates in: i.Comparing of financial statements of different periods ii.Uniform and consistent accounting treatment for ascertaining the profit and assets of the business iii.Matching periodic revenues with expenses for getting correct results of the business operations d)Accrual concept: Under accrual concept, the effects of transactions and other events are recognised on mercantile basis i.e., when they occur (and not as cash or a cash equivalent is received or paid) and they are recorded in the accounting records and reported in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. Financial statements prepared on the accrual basis inform users not only of past events involving the payment and receipt of cash but also of obligations to pay cash in the future and of resources that represent cash to be received in the future. To understand accrual assumption knowledge of revenues and expenses is required. Revenue is the gross inflow of cash, receivables and other consideration arising in the course of the ordinary activities of an enterprise from sale of goods, from rendering services and from the use by others of enterprise's resources yielding interest, royalties and dividends. For example, (1) Mr. X started a cloth merchandising. He invested , bought merchandise worth ₹ 50,000 . He sold such merchandise for ₹ 60,000 . Customers paid him ₹ 50,000 cash and assure him to pay ₹ 10,000 shortly. His revenue is ₹ 60,000 . It arose in the ordinary course of cloth business; Mr. X received ₹ 50,000 in cash and  by way of receivables. Take another example; (2) an electricity supply undertaking supplies electricity spending ₹  for fuel and wages and collects electricity bill in one month  by way of electricity charges. This is also revenue which arose from rendering services. Lastly, (3) Mr. A invested ₹  in a business. He purchased a machine paying ₹ . He rented it for ₹ 20,000 annually to Mr. B. ₹ 20,000 is the revenue of Mr. A; it arose from the use PG the enterprise's resources. Expense is a cost relating to the operations of an accounting period or to the revenue earned during the period or the benefits of which do not extend beyond that period. In the first example, Mr. X spent ₹ 50,000 to buy the merchandise; it is the expense of generating revenue of . In the second instance  are the expenses. Also whenever any asset is used it has a finite life to generate benefit. Suppose, the machine purchased by Mr. A in the third example will last ₹50,000₹10,00016,00,000₹20,00,0001,00,0001,00,000₹60,000₹16,00,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='for 10 years only. Then  is the expense every year relating to the cost of machinery. Accrual means recognition of revenue and costs as they are earned or incurred and not as money is received or paid. The accrual concept relates to measurement of income, identifying assets and liabilities. Example: Mr. J D buys clothing of ₹ 50,000 paying cash  a n d  s e l l s  a t   of which customers paid only ₹ 50,000. His revenue is ₹ 60,000 , not  cash received. Expense (i.e., cost incurred for the revenue) is ₹ 50,000 , not ₹ 20,000 cash paid. So the accrual concept based profit is ₹ 10,000 (Revenue - Expenses). As per Accrual Concept: Revenue - Expenses  Profit Accrual Concept provides the foundation on which the structure of present-day accounting has been developed. Alternative as per Cash basis Cash received in ordinary course of business - Cash paid in ordinary course of business  profit. Timing of revenue and expense booking could be different from cash receipt or paid. i.when cash received before revenue - a liability is created when cash is is booked received in advance ii.when cash received after revenue is booked iii.when cash paid before expense is booked iv.when cash paid after expense is booked an asset called Trade receivables is created creates an asset called Trade Advance when cash is paid in advance creates a liability called payables or Trade payables or outstanding liabilities e)Matching concept: In this concept, all expenses matched with the revenue of that period should only be taken into consideration. In the financial statements of the organization if any revenue is recognized then expenses related to earn that revenue should also be recognized. This concept is based on accrual concept as it considers the occurrence of expenses and income and do not concentrate on actual inflow or outflow of cash. ₹10,000₹20,000₹60,000₹50,000=='), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='This leads to adjustment of certain items like prepaid and outstanding expenses, unearned or accrued incomes. It is not necessary that every expense identify every income. Some expenses are directly related to the revenue and some are time bound. For example:- selling expenses are directly related to sales but rent, salaries etc are recorded on accrual basis for a particular accounting period. In other words periodicity concept has also been followed while applying matching concept. Mr. P K started cloth business. He purchased 10,000 pcs. garments @ ₹ 100 per piece and sold 8,000 pcs. @ ₹ 150 per piece during the accounting period of 12 months 1st January to  December, 2022. He paid shop rent @ ₹ 3,000 per month for 11 months and paid  to the suppliers of garments and received ₹  from the customers. Let us see how the accrual and periodicity concepts operate. Periodicity Concept fixes up the time-frame for which the performance is to be measured and financial position is to be appraised. Here, it is January 2022 - December, 2022. Therefore, revenues and expenses are to be measured for the year 2022 and assets and liabilities are to be ascertained as on  December, 2022. Accrual Concept operates to measure revenue of ₹ 12,00,000 (arising out of sale of garments 8,000 Pcs  ₹ 150) which accrued during 2022, not the cash received  and also the expenses correctly. Shop rent for 12 months is an expense item amounting to ₹ 36,000 , not ₹ 33,000 the cash paid. Should the accountant treat  a s  e x p e n s e s  f o r  p u r c h a s e  o f  merchandise? And should he treat ₹ 1,64,000 as profit? (Revenue ₹ 12,00,000-Merchandise ₹ 10,00,000. Shop Rent ₹ 36,000). Obviously, the answer is No. Matching links revenue with expenses. Revenue - Expenses  Profit But this unqualified equation may create misconception. It should be defined as: Periodic Profit  Periodic Revenue - Matched Expenses From the revenue of an accounting period such expenses are deducted which are expended to generate the revenue to determine profit of that period. In the given example revenue relates to only sale of 8,000 pcs. of garments. Therefore, the cost of 8,000 pcs of garments should be treated as expenses. Thus, Profit = Revenue Revenue: ₹12,00,000 31st\\xa0₹8,00,00010,00,00031st\\xa0×₹10,00,000₹10,00,000=='), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='Less Expenses: Merchandise: ₹8,00,000 Shop Rent: ₹36,000 Total Expenses: (₹8,36,000) Profit: Net Profit: ₹3,64,000 Assets: Inventory: (2,000 pcs x ₹100) = ₹2,00,000 Trade Receivables: ₹2,00,000 Cash: (Cash Receipts ₹10,00,000 - Cash Payments ₹8,33,000) = ₹1,67,000 Total Assets: ₹5,67,000 Liabilities: Trade Payables: ₹2,00,000 Expenses Payables: ₹3,000 Capital (Profit): ₹3,64,000 Total Liabilities: ₹5,67,000 Thus, accrual, matching and periodicity concepts work together for income measurement and recognition of assets and liabilities. f)Going Concern concept: T h e  f i n a n c i a l  s t a t e m e n t s  a r e  n o r m a l l y  prepared on the assumption that an enterprise is a going concern and will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Hence, it is assumed that the enterprise has neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or curtail materially the scale of its operations; if such an intention or need exists, the financial statements may have to be prepared on a different basis and, if so, the basis used needs to be disclosed. The valuation of assets of a business entity is dependent on this assumption. Traditionally, accountants follow historical cost in majority of the cases. Suppose Mr. X purchased a machine for his business paying  o u t  o f   invested by him. He also paid transportation expenses and installation ₹5,00,000₹7,00,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='charges amounting to . If he is still willing to continue the business, his financial position will be as follows: BALANCE SHEET This balance sheet shows that the entity has a total of ₹7,00,000 in capital, which matches the total value of assets. The assets are composed of machinery worth ₹5,70,000 and cash amounting to ₹1,30,000. The total liabilities equal the total assets, ensuring that the balance sheet is balanced. Now if he decides to back out and desires to sell the machine, it may fetch more than or less than . So his financial position should be different. If going concern concept is taken, increase/ decrease in the value of assets in the short-run is ignored. The concept indicates that assets are kept for generating benefit in future, not for immediate sale; current change in the asset value is not realisable and so it should not be counted. This can be understood differently with some examples we may have come across in real life. Recently during pandemic, many businesses were shutting down due to heavy losses. If the financial statement of these entities does not reveal the fact of winding up due to losses, it will mislead the stakeholders. And, a sudden news of the business shutting down would be a setback to those stakeholders. Therefore, entities need to assess at the time of preparation of financial statements, whether they are likely to continue to operate their business. If the Going Concern assumption is under question, the same information should be communicated to the stakeholders. g)Cost concept: By this concept, the value of an asset is to be determined on the basis of historical cost, in other words, acquisition cost. Although there are various measurement bases, accountants traditionally prefer this concept in the interests of objectivity. When a machine is acquired by paying ₹ , following cost concept the value of the machine is taken as ₹ 5,00,000. It is highly objective and free from all bias. Other measurement bases are not so objective. Current cost of an asset is not easily determinable. If the asset is purchased on 1.1.1995 and such model is not available in the market, it becomes difficult to determine which model is the appropriate equivalent to the existing one. Similarly, unless the machine is actually sold, realisable value will give only a hypothetical figure. Lastly, present value base is highly subjective because to know the value of the asset one has to chase the uncertain future. However, the cost concept creates a lot of distortion too as outlined below: a)In an inflationary situation when prices of all commodities go up on an average, acquisition cost loses its relevance. For example, a piece of land purchased on 1.1.1995 for ₹ 2,000 may cost ₹  as on 1.1.2022. So if ₹70,000\\n₹5,70,000\\n5,00,000\\n1,00,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='the accountant makes valuation of asset at historical cost, the accounts will not reflect the true position. b)Historical cost-based accounts may lose comparability. Mr. X invested ₹ 1,00,000 in a machine on 1.1.1995 which produces ₹ 50,000 cash inflow during the year 2022, while Mr. Y invested ₹ 5,00,000 in a machine on 1.1.2005 which produced  cash inflows during the year. Mr. X earned at the rate  while Mr. Y earned at the rate . Who is more efficient? Since the assets are recorded at the historical cost, the results are not comparable. Obviously, it is a corollary to (a). c)Many assets do not have acquisition costs. Human assets of an enterprise are an example. The cost concept fails to recognise such asset although it is a very important asset of any organization. Many other controversial issues have arisen in financial accounting that revolves around the cost concept which will be discussed at the advanced stage. However, later on we shall see that in many circumstances, the cost convention is not followed. See conservatism concept for an example, which will be discussed later on in this unit. h)Realization concept: It closely follows the cost concept. Any change in value of an asset is to be recorded only when the business realises it. When an asset is recorded at its historical cost of  and even if its current cost is  such change is not counted unless there is certainty that such change will materialize. However, accountants follow a more conservative path. They try to cover all probable losses but do not count any probable gain. That is to say, if accountants anticipate decrease in value they count it, but if there is increase in value they ignore it until it is realized. Economists are highly critical about the realisation concept. According to them, this concept creates value distortion and makes accounting meaningless. Thus, the going concern, cost concept and realization concept gives the valuation criteria. i)Dual aspect concept: This concept is the core of double entry book-keeping. Every transaction or event has two aspects: 1)It increases one Asset and decreases other Asset; 2)It increases an Asset and simultaneously increases Liability; 3)It decreases one Asset, increases another Asset; 4)It decreases one Asset, decreases a Liability. ₹50,00050%10%\\n₹5,00,000₹15,00,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content=\"Alternatively: 5)It increases one Liability, decreases other Liability; 6)It increases a Liability, increases an Asset; 7)It decreases Liability, increases other Liability; 8)It decreases Liability, decreases an Asset. j)Conservatism: Conservatism states that the accountant should not anticipate any future income however they should provide for all possible losses. When there are many alternative values of an asset, an accountant should choose the method which leads to the lesser value. Later on, we shall see that the golden rule of current assets valuation - 'cost or market price whichever is lower' originated from this concept. The Realisation Concept also states that no change should be counted unless it has materialised. The Conservatism Concept puts a further brake on it. It is not prudent to count unrealised gain but it is desirable to guard against all possible losses. For this concept there should be at least three qualitative characteristics of financial statements, namely, i.Prudence, i.e., judgement about the possible future losses which are to be guarded, as well as gains which are uncertain. ii.Neutrality, i.e., unbiased outlook is required to identify and record such possible losses, as well as to exclude uncertain gains, iii.Faithful representation of alternative values. This concept is of wider importance to investors since they would need to take a decision about their money being invested in the business. Recording future profits when these have not been earned would suggest that the business is booming, and the investors would be tempted to put more money into the same. However, eventually if the profit is not earned, the investors are likely to loose their investments. At the same time, if the entity expects to make a loss in future, it is prudent to show that loss in the books in present itself. This acts as a safeguard for the investors as they would be prudent to make the investment decisions. For example: Mr.  runs a business of computers. He purchased 10 computers at a cost of  each and is expecting to be able to sell these computers at the current market price of ₹ 25,000 each. Note that the conservatism principle does not allow to recognise the profit on the computers unless the sale has been made. Since, this is a future profit, Mr. X needs to follow X₹20,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content=\"a prudent approach while recording the transactions in his books and ignore the profit until it is earned However, before sale, the market price of the computers declines to ₹ 17,000 each. Under the conservatism approach, Mr. X needs to recognise that loss of  per computer, even though the sale has not been made. Many accounting authors, however, are of the view that conservatism essentially leads to understatement of income and wealth and it should not be the basis for the preparation of financial statements. k)Consistency: I n  o r d e r  t o  a c h i e v e  c o m p a r a b i l i t y  o f  t h e  f i n a n c i a l  statements of an enterprise through time, the accounting policies are followed consistently from one period to another; a change in an accounting policy is made only in certain exceptional circumstances. The concept of consistency is applied particularly when alternative methods of accounting are equally acceptable. For example, a company may adopt any of several methods of depreciation such as written-down-value method, straight-line method, etc. Likewise, there are many methods for valuation of inventories. But following the principle of consistency it is advisable that the company should follow consistently over years the same method of depreciation or the same method of valuation of Inventories which is chosen. However, in some cases though there is no inconsistency, they may seem to be inconsistent apparently. In case of valuation of Inventories if the company applies the principle 'at cost or market price whichever is lower' and if this principle accordingly results in the valuation of Inventories in one year at cost price and the market price in the other year, there is no inconsistency here. It is only an application of the principle. But the concept of consistency does not imply non-flexibility as not to allow the introduction of improved method of accounting. An enterprise should change its accounting policy in any of the following circumstances only: a.To bring the books of accounts in accordance with the issued Accounting Standards. b.To comply with the provision of law. c.When under changed circumstances, it is felt that new method will reflect a true and fair picture in the financial statement. l)Materiality: Materiality principle permits other concepts to be ignored, if the effect is not considered material. This principle is an exception to full disclosure principle. According to materiality principle, all the items having ₹3,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content=\"significant economic effect on the business of the enterprise should be disclosed in the financial statements and any insignificant item which will only increase the work of the accountant but will not be relevant to the users' need should not be disclosed in the financial statements. The term materiality is the subjective term. It is on the judgement, common sense and discretion of the accountant that which item is material and which is not. For example, stationary purchased by the organization though not used fully in the accounting year purchased still shown as an expense of that year because of the materiality concept. Similarly, depreciation on small items like books, calculators etc. is taken as  in the year of purchase though used by the entity for more than a year. This is because the amount for books or calculator is very small to be shown in the balance sheet though it is the asset of the company. The materiality depends not only upon the amount of the item but also upon the size of the business, nature and level of information, level of the person making the decision etc. Moreover, an item material to one person may be immaterial to another person. What is important is that omission of any information should not impair the decision-making of various users. 2.6.FUNDAMENTAL ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS There are three fundamental accounting assumptions: i.Going Concern ii.Consistency iii.Accrual All the above three fundamental accounting assumptions have already been explained in para 2.5. If nothing has been written about the fundamental accounting assumption in the financial statements then it is assumed that they have already been followed in their preparation of financial statements. However, if any of the above-mentioned fundamental accounting assumption is not followed then this fact should be specifically disclosed. 2.7.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The aim of accounting is to keep systematic records to ascertain financial performance and financial position of an entity and to communicate the relevant financial information to the interested user groups. The financial statements are basic means through which the management of an entity makes public communication of the financial information along with selected quantitative details. They are structured financial representations of the financial position and 100%\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content=\"the performance of an enterprise. To have a record of all business transactions and also to determine whether all these transactions resulted in either 'profit or loss' for the period, all the entities will prepare financial statements viz., balance sheet, profit and loss account, cash flow statement etc. by following various accounting concepts, principles, and conventions which have been already discussed in detail. 2.7.1.Qualitative Characteristics of financial Statements Qualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information provided in financial statements useful to users. The following are the important qualitative characteristics of the financial statements: 1.Understandability: An essential quality of the information provided in financial statements is that it must be readily understandable by users. For this purpose, it is assumed that users have a reasonable knowledge of business, economic activities and accounting and study the information with reasonable diligence. Information about complex matters that should be included in the financial statements because of its relevance to the economic decision-making needs of users should not be excluded merely on the ground that it may be too difficult for certain users to understand. 2.Relevance: To be useful, information must be relevant to the decision-making needs of users. Information has the quality of relevance when it influences the economic decisions of users by helping them evaluate past, present or future events or confirming, or correcting, their past evaluations. The predictive and confirmatory roles of information are interrelated. For example, information about the current level and structure of asset holdings has value to users when they endeavour to predict the ability of the enterprise to take advantage of opportunities and its ability to react to adverse situations. The same information plays a confirmatory role in respect of past predictions about, for example, the way in which the enterprise would be structured or the outcome of planned operations. Information about financial position and past performance is frequently used as the basis for predicting future financial position and performance and other matters in which users are directly interested, such as dividend and wage payments, share price movements and the ability of the enterprise to meet its commitments as they fall due. To have predictive value, information need not be in the form of an explicit forecast. The ability to make predictions from financial statements is enhanced, however, by the manner in which information on past transactions and events is displayed. For example, the predictive value of the statement of profit and loss is enhanced if unusual, abnormal and infrequent items of income and expense are separately disclosed.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='3.Reliability: To be useful, information must also be reliable, Information has the quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be depended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. Information may be relevant but so unreliable in nature or representation that its recognition may be potentially misleading. For example, if the validity and amount of a claim for damages under a legal action against the enterprise are highly uncertain, it may be inappropriate for the enterprise to recognise the amount of the claim in the balance sheet, although it may be appropriate to disclose the amount and circumstances of the claim. 4.Comparability: Users must be able to compare the financial statements of an enterprise through time in order to identify trends in its financial position, performance and cash flows. Users must also be able to compare the financial statements of different enterprises in order to evaluate their relative financial position, performance and cash flows. Hence, the measurement and display of the financial effects of like transactions and other events must be carried out in a consistent way throughout an enterprise and over time for that enterprise and in a consistent way for different enterprises. An important implication of the qualitative characteristic of comparability is that users be informed of the accounting policies employed in the preparation of the financial statements, any changes in those polices and the effects of such changes. Users need to be able to identify differences between the accounting policies for like transactions and other events used by the same enterprise from period to period and by different enterprises. Compliance with Accounting Standards, including the disclosure of the accounting policies used by the enterprise, helps to achieve comparability. The need for comparability should not be confused with mere uniformity and should not be allowed to become an impediment to the introduction of improved accounting standards. It is not appropriate for an enterprise to continue accounting in the same manner for a transaction or other event if the policy adopted is not in keeping with the qualitative characteristics of relevance and reliability. It is also inappropriate for an enterprise to leave its accounting policies unchanged when more relevant and reliable alternatives exist. Users wish to compare the financial position, performance and cash flows of an enterprise over time. Hence, it is important that the financial statements show corresponding information for the preceding period(s). The four principal qualitative characteristics are understandability, relevance,reliability and comparability. 5.Materiality: The relevance of information is affected by its materiality. Information is material if its misstatement (i.e., omission or erroneous'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='statement) could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial information. Materiality depends on the size and nature of the item or error, judged in the particular circumstances of its misstatement. Materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point rather than being a primary qualitative characteristic which the information must have if it is to be useful. 6.Faithful Representation: To be reliable, information must represent faithfully the transactions and other events it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. Thus, for example, a balance sheet should represent faithfully the transactions and other events that result in assets, liabilities and equity of the enterprise at the reporting date which meet the recognition criteria. Most financial information is subject to some risk of being less than a faithful representation of that which it purports to portray. This is not due to bias, but rather to inherent difficulties either in identifying the transactions and other events to be measured or in devising and applying measurement and presentation techniques that can convey messages that correspond with those transactions and events. In certain cases, the measurement of the financial effects of items could be so uncertain that enterprises generally would not recognise them in the financial statements; for example, although most enterprises generate goodwill internally over time, it is usually difficult to identify or measure that goodwill reliably. In other cases, however, it may be relevant to recognise items and to disclose the risk of error surrounding their recognition and measurement. 7.Substance over Form: If information is to represent faithfully the transactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality and not merely their legal form. The substance of transactions or other events is not always consistent with that which is apparent from their legal or contrived form. For example, where rights and beneficial interest in an immovable property are transferred but the documentations and legal formalities are pending, the recording of acquisition/disposal (by the transferee and transferor respectively) would in substance represent the transaction entered into. 8.Neutrality: To be reliable, the information contained in financial statements must be neutral, that is, free from bias. Financial statements are not neutral if, by the selection or presentation of information, they influence the making of a decision or judgement in order to achieve a predetermined result or outcome. 9.Prudence: The preparers of financial statements have to contend with the uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the collectability of receivables, the probable useful life of plant and machinery, and the warranty claims that may occur. Such uncertainties are recognised by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by the exercise of'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='prudence in the preparation of the financial statements. Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of the judgments needed in making the estimates required under conditions of uncertainty, such that assets or income are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not understated. However, the exercise of prudence does not allow, for example, the creation of hidden reserves or excessive provisions, the deliberate understatement of assets or income, or the deliberate overstatement of liabilities or expenses, because the financial statements would then not be neutral and, therefore, not have the quality of reliability. 10.Full, fair and adequate disclosure: The financial statement must disclose all the reliable and relevant information about the business enterprise to the management and also to their external users for which they are meant, which in turn will help them to take a reasonable and rational decision. For it, it is necessary that financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles i.e the information is accounted for and presented in accordance with its substance and economic reality and not merely with its legal form. The disclosure should be full and final so that users can correctly assess the financial position of the enterprise. The principle of full disclosure implies that nothing should be omitted while principle of fair disclosure implies that all the transactions recorded should be accounted in a manner that financial statement purports true and fair view of the results of the business of the enterprise and adequate disclosure implies that the information influencing the decision of the users should be disclosed in detail and should make sense. This principle is widely used in corporate organizations because of separation in management and ownership. The Companies Act in pursuant of this principle came out with the format of balance sheet and profit and loss account. The disclosures of all the major accounting policies and other information are to be provided in the form of footnotes, annexures etc. The practice of appending notes to the financial statements is the outcome of this principle. 11.Completeness: To be reliable, the information in financial statements must be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost. An omission can cause information to be false or misleading and thus unreliable and deficient in terms of its relevance. Thus, if accounting information is to present faithfully the transactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality, not by their legal form. For example, if a business enterprise sells its assets to others but still uses the assets as usual for the purpose of the business by making some arrangement with the seller, it simply becomes a legal transaction. The economic reality is that the business is using the assets as usual for deriving the benefit.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='Financial statement information should contain the substance of this transaction and should not only record going by legality. In order to be reliable, the financial statements information should be neutral i.e., free from bias. The prepares of financial statements however, have to contend with the uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the collectability of doubtful receivables, the probable useful life of plant and equipment and the number of warranty claims that many occur. Such uncertainties are recognised by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by exercise of prudence in the preparation of financial statements. Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of judgement needed in making the estimates required under condition of uncertainty such that assets and income are not overstated and loss and liability are not understated. \\nUNIT – 3 3.CAPITAL AND REVENUE EXPENDITURES AND RECEIPTS 3.1.INTRODUCTION'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='Accounting aims in ascertaining and presenting the results of the business for an accounting period. For ascertaining the periodical business results, the nature of transactions should be analyzed whether they are of capital or revenue nature. Revenue Expense relates to the operations of the business of an accounting period or to the revenue earned during the period or the items of expenditure, benefits of which do not extend beyond that period. Capital Expenditure, on the other hand, generates enduring benefits and helps in revenue generation over more than one accounting period. Revenue Expenses must be associated with a physical activity of the entity. Therefore, whereas production and sales generate revenue in the earning process, use of goods and services in support of those functions causes expenses to occur. Expenses are recognised in the Profit & Loss Account through matching principal which tells us when and how much of the expenses to be charged against revenue. A part of the expenditure can be capitalised only when these can be traced directly to definable streams of future benefits. The distinction of transaction into revenue and capital is done for the purpose of placing them in Profit and Loss account or in the Balance Sheet. For example: revenue expenditures are shown in the profit and loss account as their benefits are for one accounting period i.e., in which they are incurred while capital expenditures are placed on the asset side of the balance sheet as they will generate benefits for more than one accounting period and will be transferred to profit and loss account of the year on the basis of utilisation of that benefit in particular accounting year. Hence, both capital and revenue expenditures are ultimately transferred to profit and loss account. Revenue expenditures are transferred to profit and loss account in the year of spending while capital expenditures are transferred to profit and loss account of the year in which their benefits are utilised. Therefore, we can conclude that it is the time factor, which is the main determinant for transferring the expenditure to profit and loss account. Also, expenses are recognized in profit and loss account through matching concept which tells us when and how much of the expenses to be charged against revenue. However, distinction between capital and revenue creates a considerable difficulty. In many cases borderline between the two is very thin. 3.2.CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINING CAPITAL AND REVENUE EXPENDITURES The basic considerations in distinction between capital and revenue expenditures are: a)Nature of business: For a trader dealing in furniture, purchase of furniture is revenue expenditure but for any other trade, the purchase of furniture should be treated as capital expenditure and shown in the balance'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 44}, page_content='sheet as asset. Therefore, the nature of business is a very important criteria in separating an expenditure between capital and revenue. b)Recurring nature of expenditure: If the frequency of an expense is quite often in an accounting year then it is said to be an expenditure of revenue nature while nonrecurring expenditure is infrequent in nature and do not occur often in an accounting year. Monthly salary or rent is the example of revenue expenditure as they are incurred every month while purchase of assets is not the transaction done regularly therefore, classified as capital expenditure unless materiality criteria defines it as revenue expenditure. c)Purpose of expenses: Expenses for repairs of machine may be incurred in course of normal maintenance of the asset. Such expenses are revenue in nature. On the other hand, expenditure incurred for major repair of the asset so as to increase its productive capacity is capital in nature. However, determination of the cost of maintenance and ordinary repairs which should be expensed, as opposed to a cost which ought to be capitalised, is not always simple. d)Effect on revenue generating capacity of business: The expenses which help to generate income/ revenue in the current period are revenue in nature and should be matched against the revenue earned in the current period. On the other hand, if expenditure helps to generate revenue over more than one accounting period, it is generally called capital expenditure. When expenditure on improvements and repair of a fixed asset is done, it has to be charged to Profit and Loss Account if the expected future benefits from fixed assets do not change, and it will be included in book value of fixed asset, where the expected future benefits from assets increase. e)Materiality of the amount involved: Relative proportion of the amount involved is another important consideration in distinction between revenue and capital. 3.3.CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND REVENUE EXPENDITURES As we have already discussed, capital expenditure contributes to the revenue earning capacity of a business over more than one accounting period whereas revenue expense is incurred to generate revenue for a particular accounting period. The revenue expenses either occur in direct relation with the revenue or in relation with accounting periods, for example cost of goods sold, salaries, rent, etc. Cost of goods sold is directly related to sales revenue whereas rent is related to the particular accounting period. Capital expenditure may represent acquisition of any tangible or intangible fixed assets for enduring future benefits. Therefore, the benefits arising out of capital expenditure last for more than one'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 45}, page_content=\"accounting period whereas those arising out of revenue expenses expire in the same accounting period. 3.3.1.Key differences between Capital and Revenue Expenditures ➢Period of benefit: Capital expenditure is any expenditure incurred to provide a benefit over a long-term period. Revenue expenditure is any expenditure incurred to provide a benefit during the current period. ➢Enhancement vs Maintenance: Capital expenditure is incurred for the purpose of increasing the capacity of the business or to reduce the costs of the business. Revenue expenditure is incurred to maintain the earning capacity of the business. ➢Examples: Capital expenditure includes purchases of machines, cars, furniture, etc. Revenue expenditure includes repairs and maintenance, salaries of accounting staff, etc 3.4.CAPITAL RECEIPTS AND REVENUE RECEIPTS Just as a clear distinction between Capital and Revenue expenditure is necessary, in the same manner capital receipts must be distinguished from revenue receipts. Receipts which are obtained in course of normal business activities are revenue receipts (e.g., receipts from sale of goods or services, interest income etc.). On the other hand, receipts which are not revenue in nature are capital receipts (e.g., receipts from sale of fixed assets or investments, secured or unsecured loans, owners' contributions etc.). Revenue and capital receipts are recognised on accrual basis as soon as the right of receipt is established. Revenue receipts should not be equated with the actual cash receipts. Revenue receipts are credited to the Profit and Loss Account. On the other hand, Capital receipts are not directly credited to Profit and Loss Account. For example, when a fixed asset is sold for ₹ 92,000 (cost ₹ 90,000), the capital receipts ₹ 92,000 is not credited to Profit and Loss Account. Profit or Loss on sale of fixed assets is calculated and credited to Profit and Loss Account , Sale Proceeds                                    ₹ 92,000 Cost                                                    (₹ 90,000) Profit                                                   ₹ 2,000 UNIT - 4\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content='4.CONTINGENT ASSETS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITES 4.1.CONTINGENT ASSET A contingent asset may be defined as a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only after occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise. It usually arises from unplanned or unexpected events that give rise to the possibility of an inflow of economic benefits to the business entity. For example, a claim that an enterprise is pursuing through legal process, where the outcome is uncertain, is a contingent asset. As per the concept of prudence as well as the present accounting standards, an enterprise should not recognise a contingent asset. These assets are uncertain and may arise from a claim which an enterprise pursues through a legal proceeding. There is uncertainty in realisation of claim. It is possible that recognition of contingent assets may result in recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset no longer remains as contingent asset. A contingent asset need not be disclosed in the financial statements. A contingent asset is usually disclosed in the report of the approving authority (Board of Directors in the case of a company, and the corresponding approving authority in the case of any other enterprise), if an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and if it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change occurs. 4.2.CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The term \\'Contingent liability\\' can be defined as a.a possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise; or b.a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because: i.it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or ii.a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made.\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 47}, page_content='For example- Mr. X sells a machine to Mr. Y. Any damages incurred by Mr. Y while using the machine need to be compensated by Mr. X. A few days later from the date of sale of machine, Mr.  received a notice from Mr. Y who is claiming damages of ₹ 20 lac. The notice mentioned that a worker met with an accident during the use of the machine and is required to be compensated. The receipt of this notice does not suggest that Mr. X is liable to pay the amount, although this needs to be investigated and confirmed, as whether the damage arose due to any defect in the machine or it is due to negligence while operating the machine. Although, the receipt of the notice results into an event which requires recognition of a contingent liability since there is a possible obligation, and that can only be confirmed in future. Taking another example let us assume Mr. AB sells cars to its customers. One of the cars caught fire due to malfunctioning of a faulty part during the test drive by one of the customers. The customer has filed a court case seeking a claim of ₹ 50 lac due to the incidence. While Mr. AB acknowledges that there is a present obligation, it is not certain that whether he is expected to pay for any damages. The final outcome will only be known during the court proceedings. A contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and may arise in future depending on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events [part (a) of the definition]. A contingent liability may also be a present obligation that arises from past events [(part (b) of the definition)]. An enterprise should not recognise a contingent liability in balance sheet, however it is required to be disclosed in the notes to accounts, unless possibility of outflow of a resource embodying economic benefits is remote. These liabilities are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits has become probable. If it becomes probable that an outflow or future economic benefits will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognised in financial statements of the period in which the change in probability occurs except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made. 4.3.DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND LIABILITIES The distinction between a liability and a contingent liability is generally based on the judgement of the management. A liability is defined as the present financial obligation of an enterprise, which arises from past events. The settlement of a liability results in an outflow from the enterprises of resources embodying X'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 48}, page_content='economic benefits. On the other hand, in the case of contingent liability, either outflow of resources to settle the obligation is not probable or the amount expected to be paid to settle the liability cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Examples of contingent liabilities are claims against the enterprise not acknowledged as debts, guarantees given in respect of third parties, liability in respect of bills discounted and statutory liabilities under dispute etc. In addition to present obligations that are recognized as liabilities in the balance sheet, enterprises are required to disclose contingent liability in their balance sheets by way of notes. 4.4.DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS Provision means \"any amount written off or retained by way of providing for depreciation, renewal or diminution in the value of assets or retained by way of providing for any known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with substantial accuracy\". It is important to know the difference between provisions and contingent liabilities. The distinction between both of them can be explained as follows: Provision is a present liability of uncertain amount that can be reliably measured using substantial estimation, whereas a contingent liability is a potential obligation dependent on uncertain future events. A provision satisfies the recognition criteria, while a contingent liability does not meet these criteria. Provision is acknowledged when there is a current obligation from past events likely to result in an economic benefit outflow, and the amount can be reliably estimated; in contrast, a contingent liability includes obligations not recognized due to uncertainty in benefit outflow or amount estimation. Management recognizes a provision in the balance sheet if it is probable that fulfilling an obligation will result in economic benefits outflow; conversely, if economic benefits outflow is unlikely, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability.  Let us take an example to understand the distinction between provisions and contingent liabilities. The Central Excise Officer imposes a penalty on Alpha Ltd. for violation of a provision in the Central Excise Act. The company goes on an appeal. If the management of the company estimates that it is probable that the company will have to pay the penalty, it recognises a provision for the liability. On the other hand, if the management anticipates that the judgement of the appellate authority will be in its favour and it is less likely that the company will have to pay the penalty, it will disclose the obligation as a contingent liability instead of recognising a provision for the same.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 49}, page_content='UNIT - 5  5.ACCOUNTING POLICIES 5.1.MEANING OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Policies refer to specific accounting principles and methods of applying these principles adopted by the enterprise in the preparation and presentation of financial statements. Policies are based on various accounting concepts, principles and conventions that have already been explained in Unit 2 of Chapter 1. There is no single list of accounting policies, which are applicable to all enterprises in all circumstances. Enterprises operate in diverse and complex environmental situations and so they have to adopt various policies. The choice of specific accounting policy appropriate to the specific circumstances in which the enterprise is operating, calls for considerate judgement by the management. ICAI has been trying to reduce the number of acceptable accounting policies through Guidance Notes and Accounting Standards in its combined efforts with the government, other regulatory agencies and progressive managements. Already it has achieved some progress in this respect. The areas wherein different accounting policies are frequently encountered can be given as follows: 1)Valuation of Inventories; 2)Valuation of Investments. This list should not be taken as exhaustive but is only illustrative. As the course will progress, students will see the intricacies of the various accounting policies. Suppose an enterprise holds some investments in the form of shares of a company at the end of an accounting period. For valuation of shares, the enterprise may adopt FIFO, average method etc. The method selected by that enterprise for valuation is called an accounting policy. 5.2.SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES Choice of accounting policy is an important policy decision which affects the performance measurement as well as financial position of the business entity. Selection of inappropriate accounting policy may lead to understatement or overstatement of performance and financial position. Thus, accounting policy should be selected with due care after considering its effect on the financial'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 50}, page_content='performance of the business enterprise from the angle of various users of accounts. It is believed that no unified and exhaustive list of accounting policies can be suggested which has universal application. Three major characteristics which should be considered for the purpose of selection and application of accounting policies. viz., Prudence, Substance over form, and Materiality. The financial statements should be prepared on the basis of such accounting policies, which exhibit true and fair view of state of affairs of Balance Sheet and the Profit & Loss Account. Examples wherein selection from a set of accounting policies is made, can be given as follows:- 1.Inventories are valued at cost except for finished goods and by-products. Finished goods are valued at lower of cost or market value and by-products are valued at net realizable value. 2.Investments (long term) are valued at their acquisition cost. Provision for permanent diminution in value has been made wherever necessary. Sometimes a wrong or inappropriate treatment is adopted for items in Balance Sheet, or Profit & Loss Account, or other statement. Disclosure of the treatment adopted is necessary in any case, but disclosure cannot rectify a wrong or inappropriate treatment. 5.3.CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES A change in accounting policies should be made in the following conditions: a)It is required by some statute or for compliance with an Accounting Standard b)Change would result in more appropriate presentation of financial statement Change in accounting policy may have a material effect on the items of financial statements. For example, if cost formula used for inventory valuation is changed from weighted average to FIFO, or if interest is capitalized which was earlier not in practice, or if proportionate amount of interest is changed to inventory which was earlier not the practice, all these may increase or decrease the net profit. Unless the effect of such change in accounting policy is quantified, the financial statements may not help the users of accounts. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the effect of change on financial statement items like assets, liabilities, profit/loss. For example, Omega Enterprises revised its accounting policy relating to valuation of inventories to include applicable production overheads.

UNIT - 6  6.ACCOUNTING AS A MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE - VALUATION PRINCIPLES, ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 6.1.MEANING OF MEASUREMENT Measurement is vital aspect of accounting. Primarily transactions and events are measured in terms of money. Any measurement discipline deals with three basic elements of measurement viz., identification of objects and events to be measured, selection of standard or scale to be used, and evaluation of dimension of measurement standards or scale. Prof. R. J. Chambers defined \\'measurement\\' as \"assignment of numbers to objects and events according to rules specifying the property to be measured, the scale to be used and the dimension of the unit\". (R.J. Chambers, Accounting Evaluation and Economic Behaviour, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 1966, P.10). Kohler defined measurement as the assignment of a system of ordinal or cardinal numbers to the results of a scheme of inquiry or apparatus of observations in accordance with logical or mathematical rules - [A Dictionary of Accountant]. Ordinal numbers, or ordinals, are numbers used to denote the position in an ordered sequence: first, second, third, fourth, etc., whereas a cardinal number says \\'how many there are\\': one, two, three, four, etc. Chambers\\' definition has been widely used to judge how far accounting can be treated as a measurement discipline. According to this definition, the three elements of measurement are: (2) Selection of standard or scale to be used; (3) Evaluation of dimension of measurement standard or scale. 6.2.OBJECTS OR EVENTS TO BE MEASURED'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 52}, page_content=\"We have earlier defined Accounting as the process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decisions by the users of the information. So accounting essentially includes measurement of 'information'. Decision makers need past, present and future information. For external users, generally the past information is communicated. There is no uniform set of events and transactions in accounting which are required for decision making. For example, in cash management, various cash receipts and expenses are the necessary objects and events. Obviously, the decision makers need past cash receipts and expenses data along with projected receipts and expenses. For giving loan to a business one needs information regarding the repayment ability (popularly called debt servicing) of principal and interest. This also includes past information, current state of affairs as well as future projections. It may be mentioned that past and present objects and events can be measured with some degree of accuracy but future events and objects are only predicted, not measured. Prediction is an essential part of accounting information. Decision makers have to take decisions about the unseen future for which they need suitable information. 6.3.STANDARD OR SCALE OF MEASUREMENT In accounting, money is the scale of measurement (see money measurement concept), although now-a- days quantitative information is also communicated along with monetary information. Money as a measurement scale has no universal denomination. It takes the shape of currency ruling in a country. For example, in India the scale of measurement is Rupee, in the U.K. PoundSterling (  ), in Germany Deutschmark (DM), in the United States Dollar ($) and so on. Also there is no constant exchange relationship among the currencies. If one businessman in India took loan  from a businessman of the U.S.A., he would enter the transaction in his books in terms of ₹ Suppose at the time of loan agreement exchange rate was US . Then loan amounted to ₹ . Afterwards the exchange rate has been changed to . At the changed exchange rate the loan amount becomes₹ . So money as a unit of measurement lacks universal applicability across the boundary of a country unless a common currency is in vogue. Since the rate of exchange fluctuates between two currencies over the time, money as a measurement scale also becomes volatile. 6.4.DIMENSION OF MEASUREMENT SCALE An ideal measurement scale should be stable over time. For example, if one buys . cabbage today, the quantity he receives will be the same if he will buy . £$5,000$=₹502,50,000$1=₹552,75,0001\\xa0kg1\\xa0kg\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 53}, page_content=\"cabbage one year later. Similarly, length of 1 metre cloth will not change if it is bought a few days later. That is to say a measurement scale should be stable in dimension. Money as a scale of measurement is not stable. There occurs continuous change in the input output prices. The same quantity of money may not have the ability to buy same quantity of identical goods at different dates. Thus information of one year measured in money terms may not be comparable with that of another year. Suppose production and sales of a company in two different years are as follows: In Year 1, 5,000 pieces were valued at ₹5,00,000, while in Year 2, 4,500 pieces were valued at ₹5,40,000 Looking at the monetary figures one may be glad for  sales growth. In fact there was  production and sales decline. The growth envisaged through monetary figures is only due to price change. Let us suppose further that the cost of production for the above mentioned two years is as follows: In Year 1, the quantity was 5,000 pieces valued at ₹4,00,000; in Year 2, it was 4,500 pieces valued at ₹4,50,000. Take Gross profit  Sales - Cost of Production. Then in the first year profit was ₹ 1,00,000 while in the second year the profit was ₹ 90,000 . There was  decline in gross profit. So, money as a unit of measurement is not stable in the dimension. Thus, Accounting measures information mostly in money terms which is not a stable scale having universal applicability and also not stable in dimension for comparison over the time. So it is not an exact measurement discipline. 6.5.ACCOUNTING AS A MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE How do you measure a transaction or an event? Unless the measurement base is settled we cannot progress to the record keeping function of book-keeping. It has been explained that accounting is meant for generating information suitable for users' judgments and decisions. But generation of such information is preceded by recording, classifying and summarising data. By that process it measures performance of the business entity by way of profit or loss and shows its financial position. Thus, measurement is an important part of accounting discipline. But a set of theorems governs the whole measurement sub- system. These theorems should be carefully understood to know how the cogs of the 'accounting-wheel' work. Now-a-days accounting profession earmarked three theorems namely going concern, consistency and accrual as fundamental accounting assumptions, i.e., these assumptions are taken for granted. Also while measuring, classifying, summarising and also presenting, various policies are adopted. Recording, classifying summarising and communication of information are also important part of accounting, which do not fall within the purview of measurement 8%10%=10%\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 54}, page_content='discipline. Therefore, we cannot simply say that accounting is a measurement discipline. But in accounting money is the unit of measurement. So, let us take one thing for granted that all transactions and events are to be recorded in terms of money only. Quantitative information is also required in many cases but such information is only supplementary to monetary information. 6.6.VALUATION PRINCIPLES There are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are: i.Historical Cost; ii.Current Cost: iii.Realizable Value; iv.Present Value. Let us discuss these principles in detail. 1.Historical Cost: It means acquisition price. For example, the businessman paid  to purchase the machine and spend  on its installation, its acquisition price including installation charges is . The historical cost of machine would be ₹8,00,000. According to this base, assets are recorded at an amount of cash or cash equivalent paid at the time of acquisition. Liabilities are recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business. When a businessman, takes ₹ 5,00,000 loan from a bank @ 10% interest p.a., it is to be recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. Here the obligation is the repayment of loan as well as payment of interest at an agreed rate i.e. . Proceeds received are  - it is historical cost of the transactions. Take another case regarding payment of income tax liability. You know every individual has to pay income tax on his income if it exceeds certain minimum limit. But the income tax liability is not settled immediately when one earns his income. The income tax authority settles it some time later, which is technically called assessment year. Then how does he record this liability? As per historical cost base it is to be recorded at an amount expected to be paid to discharge the liability. ₹7,00,000₹1,00,000₹8,00,000\\n10%₹5,00,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='Companies usually apply historical cost method in case of long-term assets like machinery, furniture, licenses etc. 2.Current Cost: Take that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 at . As per historical cost base he has to record it at  i.e. the acquisition price. As on 1.1.2022, Mr. X found that it would cost ₹  to purchase that machine. Take also that Mr. X took loan from a bank as on 1.1.2011 ₹ 5,00,000 @ 18% p.a. repayable at the end of 15 th year together with interest. As on 1.1.2022 the bank announces  p r e p a y m e n t  penalty on the loan amount if it is paid within 15 days starting from that day. As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000. Current cost gives an alternative measurement base. Assets are carried out at the amount of cash or cash equivalent that would have to be paid if the same or an equivalent asset was acquired currently. Liabilities are carried at the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents that would be required to settle the obligation currently. So as per current cost base, the machine value is  while the value of bank loan is ₹ 5,05,000. Realisable Value: Suppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently. Take also that Mr. X found that he had no money to pay off the bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 currently. As per realisable value, assets are carried at the amount of cash or cash equivalents that could currently be obtained by selling the assets in an orderly disposal. Haphazard disposal may yield something less. Liabilities are carried at their settlement values; i.e. the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents expressed to be paid to satisfy the liabilities in the normal course of business. So, the machine should be recorded at ₹  the realisable value in an orderly sale while the bank loan should be recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 the settlement value in the normal course of business. Realisable value concept is commonly applied in case of inventories. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Present Value: Suppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference. Now think the machine purchased by Mr. X can work for another 10 years and is supposed to generate cash @ ₹ 1,00,000 p.a. Also take that bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 taken by Mr.  is to be repaid as on 31.12.2028. Annual interest is . ₹7,00,000₹7,00,00025,00,0001%\\n₹25,00,000₹7,00,000₹25,00,00020,00,000\\nX₹90,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content=\"As per present value, an asset is carried at the present discounted value of the future net cash inflows that the item is expected to generate in the normal course of business. Liabilities are carried at the present discounted value of future net cash outflows that are expected to be required to settle the liabilities in the normal course of business. The concept of Present Value is common in case of accounting for investments and loans. The term 'discount', 'cash inflow' and 'cash outflow' need a little elaboration. ₹ 100 in hand as on 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 in hand as on 31.12.2022. There is a time gap of one year. If Mr. X had ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 he could use it at that time. If he received it only on 31.12.2022, he had to sacrifice his use for a year. The value of this sacrifice is called 'time value of money'. Mr.  w o u l d  sacrifice i.e. he would agree to take money on 31.12.2022 if he had been compensated for the sacrifice. So a rational man will never exchange ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 with ₹ 100 to be received on 31.12.2022. Then ₹ 100 of 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 of 31.12.2022. To make the money receivable at a future date equal with the money of the present date it is to be devalued. Such devaluation is called discounting of future money.

Total of all these present values is ₹ 4,19,246. Since the machine purchased by Mr. X will produce cash equivalent to ₹ 4,19,246 in terms of present value, it is to be valued at such amount as per present value measurement basis. Here, Mr.  will receive  at different points of time-these are cash inflows. In the other example, he has to pay interest and principal of bank loan-these are cash outflows.

The bank loan liability has a historical cost of ₹5,00,000, a current cost of ₹5,05,000, a realisable value of ₹5,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,70,094.  The accounting system which we shall discuss in the remaining chapters is also called historical cost accounting. However, this need not mean that one shall follow only historical cost basis of accounting. In the later stages of the CA course, we shall see that the accounting system uses all types of measurement bases although under the traditional system most of the transactions and events are measured in terms of historical cost. 6.7.MEASUREMENT AND VALUATION Value relates to the benefits to be derived from objects, abilities or ideas. To the economist, value is the utility (i.e.; satisfaction) of an economic resource to the person contemplating or enjoying its use. In accounting, to mean value of an object, abilities or ideas, a monetary surrogate is used. That is to say, value is measured in terms of money. Suppose, an individual purchased a car paying . Its value lies in the satisfaction to be derived by that individual using the car in future. Economists often use ordinal scale to indicate the level of satisfaction. But accountants use only cardinal scales. If the value of car is taken as ₹ 2,50,000 it is only one type of value called acquisition cost or historical cost. So value is indicated by measurement. In accounting the value is always measured in terms of money. 6.8.ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Earlier in this unit we have learned how to measure a transaction, which had already taken place and for which either some value/money has been paid or Ai[1−1(1+i)n]1,00,0000.20[1−1(1+0.20)10]=₹4,19,24690,0000.20[1−1(1+0.20)5]+5,00,000(1+0.20)5=₹2,69,155+₹2,00,939=₹4,70,094\\n₹2,50,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content='some valuation principles are to be adopted for their measurement. But there are certain items, which have not occurred therefore cannot be measured using valuation principles still they are necessary to record in the books of account, for example, provision for doubtful debts. For such items, we need some value. In such a situation reasonable estimates based on the existing situation and past experiences are made. The measurement of certain assets and liabilities is based on estimates of uncertain future events. As a result of the uncertainties inherent in business activities, many financial statement items cannot be measured with precision but can only be estimated. Therefore, the management makes various estimates and assumptions of assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses as on the date of preparation of financial statements. Such estimates are made in connection with the computation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses as well as, accruals, provisions and employee benefit obligations. Also estimates may be required in determining the bad debts, useful life and residual value of an item of plant and machinery and inventory obsolescence. The process of estimation involves judgements based on the latest information available. An estimate may require revision if changes occur regarding circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of new information, more experience or subsequent developments. Change in accounting estimate means difference arises between certain parameters estimated earlier and re-estimated during the current period or actual result achieved during the current period. Few examples of situations wherein accounting estimates are needed can be given as follows: 1.A company incurs expenditure of  on development of patent. Now the company has to estimate that for how many years the patent would benefit the company. This estimation should be based on the latest information and logical judgement. 2.A company dealing in long-term construction contracts, uses percentage of completion method for recognizing the revenue at the end of the accounting year. Under this method the company has to make adequate provisions for unseen contingencies, which can take place while executing the remaining portion of the contract. Since provisioning for unseen contingencies requires estimation, there may be excess or short provisioning, which is to be adjusted in the period when it is recognised. 3.A company has to provide for taxes which is also based on estimation as there can be some interpretational differences on account of which tax authorities may either accept the expenditure or refuse it. This will ultimately lead to different tax liability. ₹10,00,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 60}, page_content=\"4.Company XY Ltd purchases a machine for ₹ 10 lac in 2021. The procurement head suggested that the machine is expected to offer benefits up to next 10 years. After 3 years of its use, the machine has become obsolete as new technologies are now available providing better productivity than the existing machine. Hence, it is now expected that the machine can only offer benefits for further 3 years. This is a change in estimate in the useful life of the machine. \\nUNIT - 7  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 7.1 INTRODUCTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Accounting as a 'language of business' communicates the financial results of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. If the financial accounting process is not properly regulated, there is possibility of financial statements being misleading, tendentious and providing a distorted picture of the business, rather than the true. To ensure transparency, consistency, comparability, adequacy and reliability of financial reporting, it is essential to standardize the accounting principles and policies. Accounting Standards (ASs) provide framework and standard accounting policies for treatment of transactions and events so that the financial statements of different enterprises become comparable. Accounting standards are written policy documents issued by the expert accounting body or by the government or other regulatory body covering the aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of accounting transactions and events in the financial statements. The ostensible purpose of the standard setting bodies is to promote the dissemination of timely and useful financial information to investors and certain other parties having an interest in the company's economic performance. The accounting standards deal with the issues of - i.recognition of events and transactions in the financial statements; ii.measurement of these transactions and events;\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 61}, page_content='iii.presentation of these transactions and events in the financial statements in a manner that is meaningful and understandable to the reader; and iv.the disclosure requirements which should be there to enable the public at large and the stakeholders and the potential investors in particular, to get an insight into what these financial statements are trying to reflect and thereby facilitating them to take prudent and informed business decisions. 7.2 OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The whole idea of accounting standards is centered around harmonisation of accounting policies and practices followed by different business entities so that the diverse accounting practices adopted for various aspects of accounting can be standardised. Accounting Standards standardise diverse accounting policies with a view to: i.eliminate the non-comparability of financial statements and thereby improving the reliability of financial statements; and ii.provide a set of standard accounting policies, valuation norms and disclosure requirements. Accounting standards reduce the accounting alternatives in the preparation of financial statements within the bounds of rationality, thereby ensuring comparability of financial statements of different enterprises.  7.3 BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Accounting standards seek to describe the accounting principles, the valuation techniques and the methods of applying the accounting principles in the preparation and presentation of financial statements so that they may give a true and fair view. By setting the accounting standards, the accountant has following benefits: i.Standards reduce to a reasonable extent or eliminate altogether confusing variations in the accounting treatments used to prepare financial statements. ii.There are certain areas where important information are not statutorily required to be disclosed. Standards may call for disclosure beyond that required by law. iii.The application of accounting standards would, to a limited extent, facilitate comparison of financial statements of companies situated in different parts of the world and also of different companies situated in the same country. However, it should be noted in this respect that differences in the institutions, traditions and legal systems from one country to another'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 62}, page_content='give rise to differences in accounting standards adopted in different countries. The benefits of accounting standards. The content can be described in textbook language as follows Benefits of Accounting Standards Accounting standards provide several key advantages that are crucial for the uniformity and transparency of financial reporting: 1.Standardisation of Alternative Accounting Treatments: Accounting standards mitigate inconsistencies by standardizing various methods available for accounting treatments. This eliminates the discrepancies that can arise when different practices are applied to similar transactions. 2.Requirements for Additional Disclosures: They necessitate comprehensive disclosures that give users of financial statements a more complete understanding of the financial information presented. These disclosures are integral to ensuring that all relevant financial data is communicated effectively. 3.Comparability of Financial Statements: One of the most significant benefits of accounting standards is the comparability they afford. By providing a consistent framework for financial reporting, these standards make it possible to compare financial statements across different periods and entities, enhancing the decision-making process for investors, regulators, and other stakeholders. The diagram illustrates a cyclic relationship indicating that the standardization of accounting treatments and the requirement for additional disclosures contribute to the overall benefits of accounting standards, which in turn leads to the comparability of financial statements. However, there are some limitations of accounting standards: i.Difficulties in making choice between different treatments: Alternative solutions to certain accounting problems may each have arguments to recommend them. Therefore, the choice between different alternative accounting treatments may become difficult. ii.Restricted scope: Accounting standards cannot override the statute. The standards are required to be framed within the ambit of prevailing statutes. Limitations of Accounting Standards While accounting standards play a crucial role in financial reporting, they are not without limitations:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content='1.Difficulties in Making Choice Between Different Treatments: Accounting standards can sometimes present challenges in selecting the most appropriate accounting treatment among the various alternatives allowed. This difficulty arises due to the need for professional judgment in specific scenarios where multiple treatments might seem applicable. 2.Restricted Scope: The scope of accounting standards can sometimes be limited. They may not cover every possible scenario or emerging transaction type, leading to areas where the accountant must use their discretion or seek guidance from other regulatory frameworks. These limitations underscore the necessity for continuous review and updating of accounting standards to ensure they remain relevant and comprehensive enough to address new types of transactions and evolving business practices. 7.4 PROCESS OF FORMULATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN INDIA The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), being a premier accounting body in the country, took upon itself the leadership role by constituting the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in 1977. The ICAI has taken significant initiatives in the setting and issuing procedure of Accounting Standards to ensure that the standard-setting process is fully consultative and transparent. The ASB considers International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) while framing Indian Accounting Standards (ASs) in India and try to integrate them, in the light of the applicable laws, customs, usages and business environment in the country. The composition of ASB includes, representatives of industries (namely, ASSOCHAM, CII, FICCI), regulators, academicians, government departments etc. Although ASB is a body constituted by the Council of the ICAI, it (ASB) is independent in the formulation of accounting standards and Council of the ICAI is not empowered to make any modifications in the draft accounting standards formulated by ASB without consulting with the ASB. The standard-setting procedure of Accounting Standards Board (ASB) can be briefly outlined as follows: •Identification of broad areas by ASB for formulation of AS. •Constitution of study groups by ASB to consider specific projects and to prepare preliminary drafts of the proposed accounting standards. The draft normally includes objective and scope of the standard, definitions of the terms used in the standard, recognition and measurement principles wherever applicable and presentation and disclosure requirements. •Consideration of the preliminary draft prepared by the study group of ASB and revision, if any, of the draft on the basis of deliberations.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content=\"•Circulation of draft of accounting standard (after revision by ASB) to the Council members of the ICAI and specified outside bodies such as Department of Company Affairs (DCA), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C&AG), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE), etc. for comments. •Meeting with the representatives of the specified outside bodies to ascertain their views on the draft of the proposed accounting standard. •Finalisation of the exposure draft of the proposed accounting standard and its issuance inviting public comments. •Consideration of comments received on the exposure draft and finalisation of the draft accounting standard by the ASB for submission to the Council of the ICAI for its consideration and approval for issuance. •Consideration of the final draft of the proposed standard and by the Council of the ICAI, and if found necessary, modification of the draft in consultation with the ASB is done. •The accounting standard on the relevant subject (for non-corporate entities) is then issued by the ICAI. For corporate entities the accounting standards are issued by The Central Government of India. 7.5 LIST OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN INDIA The 'Accounting Standards' issued by the Accounting Standards Board establish standards which have to be complied by the business entities so that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The first book that described a double entry accounting system. Double entry system of book-keeping has emerged in the process of evolution of various accounting techniques. It is the only scientific system of accounting. According to it, every transaction has two-fold aspects-debit and credit and both the aspects are to be recorded in the books of accounts. Therefore, in every transaction at least two accounts are effected. For example, on purchase of furniture either the cash balance will be reduced or a liability to the supplier will arise and new asset furniture is acquired. This has been made clear already, the Double Entry System records both the aspects. It may be defined as the system which recognises and records both the aspects of transactions. This system has proved to be systematic and has been found of great use for recording the financial transactions for all kind of entities requiring use of money. 1.2.ADVANTAGES OF DOUBLE ENTRY SYSTEM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 67}, page_content=\"This system affords the under mentioned advantages: i.By the use of this system the accuracy of the accounting work can be established, through the device of the trial balance. ii.The profit earned or loss incurred during a period can be ascertained together with details. iii.The financial position of the entity or the institution concerned can be ascertained at the end of each period, through preparation of the financial statements. iv.The system permits accounts to be kept in as much details as necessary and, therefore provides significant information for the purpose of control and reporting. v.Result of one year may be compared with those of previous years and reasons for the change may be ascertained. In view of the above, the advantages of double entry system has been used extensively in all countries. 1.3.Account We have seen how the accounting equation becomes true in all cases. A person starts his business with say, ₹  as capital with corresponding balance of cash ₹ . For example, transactions entered into by the entity will alter the cash balance in two ways, one will increase the cash balance and other will reduce it. Payment for goods purchased, salaries paid and rent expense paid, etc., will reduce the cash balance whereas sales of goods for cash and collection from customers will increase it. We can change the cash balance with every transaction but this will be cumbersome. Instead it would be better if all the transactions that lead to an increase are recorded in one column and those that reduce the cash balance in another column; then the net result can be ascertained. If we add all increases to the opening balance of cash and then deduct the total of all decreases, we shall know the closing balance. In this manner, significant information will be available relating to cash. The two columns which we referred above are put usually in the form of an account, called the '  ' form. This is illustrated below by taking imaginary figures: Since, each T-account shows only amounts and not transaction descriptions, we record each transaction in some way, such as by numbering used in this illustration. However, one can use date also for this purpose. 10,00,00010,00,000\\nT\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 68}, page_content=\"What we have done is to record the increase of cash on the left hand side and the decrease on the right hand side; the closing balance has been ascertained by deducting the total of payments, ₹ 23,00,000 from the total of the left - hand side. Such a treatment of receipts and payments of cash is very convenient. Here we talked about only one account namely cash, now let us see how to make T-accounts when assets as well as liabilities are effected from a particular transaction. Now, let us take some more examples:- Transaction 1: Initial investment by owners ₹ 25,00,000 in cash. This will effect two accounts namely cash and capital. The asset cash increases and the stock holders' equity paid up capital also increases. CAPITAL Capital account increased by ₹25,00,000. Transaction 2: Paid cash to the creditors ₹  This will effect cash account which will decrease and creditors account which is a liability will also decrease. In transaction 2, cash payment to the creditors was ₹14,00,000, resulting in a decrease in both the cash account and the creditors account, which is a liability. The proper form of an account includes columns for Date, Particulars, and Amount for both the debit and credit sides.  The columns are self-explanatory. 1.4.DEBIT AND CREDIT We have seen that in T-accounts increase and decrease entries are made on the left and right side of the accounts for assets respectively and vice-versa for liabilities. But, formally accountants use the term Debit (Dr.) to denote an entry on the left side of any account and Credit (Cr.) to denote an entry on the right side of any account. We know that by deducting the total of liabilities from the total of assets the amount of capital is ascertained, as is indicated by the accounting equation. 14,00,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 69}, page_content=\"The Basic Accounting Equation The accounting equation is a cornerstone of double-entry bookkeeping and represents the relationship between a company's assets, liabilities, and capital. It can be expressed in two equivalent forms: 1.Assets = Liabilities + Capital This equation signifies that the total assets of a company are financed by obligations to external parties (liabilities) and claims by the owners (capital). 2.Assets - Liabilities = Capital Alternatively, this rearrangement of the equation illustrates that the capital is equal to the assets minus the liabilities, indicating the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting liabilities. Both expressions of the accounting equation provide the same information: the resources owned by the company (assets) are balanced by the company's debts (liabilities) and the owners' interest (capital). To understand the equation better, let us expand it:- The Expanded Accounting Equation The accounting equation is a fundamental concept that illustrates the relationship between a company's assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity. It is represented in two interrelated forms: 1.Basic Form: ·Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity 2.Expanded Form: Assets = Liabilities + (Contributed Capital + Beginning Retained Earnings + Revenue - Expenses - Dividends) This expanded form breaks down stockholders' equity into more specific components: Contributed Capital: The capital that has been directly invested by the stockholders into the company. Beginning Retained Earnings: The accumulated earnings from previous periods that have not been distributed to stockholders as dividends. Revenue: The income generated from the company’s main operations and other activities. Expenses: The costs incurred in the process of earning revenue. Dividends: The portion of earnings distributed to stockholders. The equation emphasizes that a company's assets are financed either by borrowing money (liabilities) or by funds provided by the owners (stockholders' equity), which is itself composed of various factors including investments by the owners, retained earnings, and the results of operations.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 70}, page_content=\"Here, Contributed capital  the original capital introduced by the owner. Beginning retained earnings  previous earnings not distributed to the shareholders. Revenue  generated from the ongoing activities of the business Expenses  cost incurred for the operations of the company. Dividends  earnings distributed to the shareholders of the company We have also seen that if there is any change on one side of the equation, it is bound to be similar change on the other side of the equation or amongst items covered by it or an opposite change on the same side of the equation. This is illustrated below: Started business with cash ₹10,00,000, increasing total assets and owner's capital by the same amount. Borrowed ₹5,00,000, which increased total liabilities and total assets. Withdrew cash from business ₹2,00,000, decreasing total assets and owner's capital. Loan repaid to the extent of ₹1,00,000, decreasing total liabilities and total assets. Bought furniture worth ₹3,00,000 with cash, increasing total assets in the form of furniture while decreasing cash. The balance shows total assets of ₹12,00,000, total liabilities of ₹4,00,000, and owner's capital of ₹8,00,000.  As has been seen previously, what has been given above is suitable only if the number of transactions is small. But if the number is large, a different procedure of putting increases and decreases in different columns will be useful and this will also yield significant information. The transactions given above are being shown below according to this method. Total assets increased by ₹15,00,000 and decreased by ₹3,00,000. Liabilities decreased by ₹1,00,000 and increased by ₹5,00,000. Owner's capital decreased by ₹2,00,000 and increased by ₹10,00,000. The balance shows total assets of ₹12,00,000, liabilities of ₹4,00,000, and owner's capital of ₹8,00,000.  It is a tradition that: i.increases in assets are recorded on the left-hand side and decreases in them on the righthand side; and ==\\xa0=\\xa0=\\xa0=\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 71}, page_content=\"ii.in the case of liabilities and capital, increases are recorded on the right-hand side and decreases on the left-hand side. When two sides are put together in T form, the left-hand side is called the 'debit side' and the right hand side is 'credit side'. When in an account a record is made on the debit or left-hand side, one says that one has debited that account; similarly to record an amount on the credit or right-hand side, it is said the account has been credited. From the above, the following rules can be obtained: i.When there is an increase in the amount of an asset, its account is debited; the account will be credited if there is a reduction in the amount of the asset concerned: Suppose a firm purchases furniture for , the furniture account will be debited by ₹  since the asset has increased by this amount. Suppose later the firm sells furniture to the extent of ₹ 3,00,000 the reduction will be recorded by crediting the furniture account by ₹ 3,00,000. FURNITURE The furniture account shows an increase of ₹8,00,000 due to cash paid for purchase, and a decrease of ₹3,00,000 due to sale or disposal by cash. The balance in the furniture account is ₹5,00,000.  ii.If the amount of a liability increases, the increase will be entered on the credit side of the liability account, i.e. the account will be credited: similarly, a liability account will be debited if there is a reduction in the amount of the liability. Suppose a firm borrows ₹ 5,00,000 from Mohan; Mohan's account will be credited since  is now owing to him. If, later, the loan is repaid, Mohan's account will be debited since the liability no longer exists. MOHAN The account of Mohan shows a decrease by ₹5,00,000 due to cash payment made to him, and an increase by ₹5,00,000 due to cash received from him.  iii.An increase in the owner's capital is recorded by crediting the capital account: Suppose the proprietor introduces additional capital, the capital account will be credited. If the owner withdraws some money, i.e., makes a drawing, the capital account will be debited. iv.Profit leads to an increase in the capital and a loss to reduction: According to the rule mentioned in (iii) above, profit & incomes may be directly credited to the capital account and losses & expenses may be similarly debited. However, it is more useful to record all incomes, gains, expenses and losses separately. By doing so, very useful information will be available regarding the ₹8,00,0008,00,000\\n₹5,00,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 72}, page_content=\"factors which have contributed to the year's profits and losses. Later the net result of all these is ascertained and adjusted in the capital account. v.Expenses are debited and Incomes are credited: Since incomes and gains increase capital, the rule is to credit all gains and incomes in the accounts concerned and since expenses and losses decrease capital, the rule is to debit all expenses and losses. Of course, if there is a reduction in any income or gain, the account concerned will be debited; similarly, for any reduction in an expenses or loss the concerned account will be credited. The rules given above are summarised below Rules of Debit and Credit in Double-Entry Bookkeeping  In the double-entry accounting system, every financial transaction affects at least two accounts in a way that the accounting equation remains balanced. The rules for recording increases and decreases in different account types are: 1.Assets: Increases in assets are recorded as debits. Decreases in assets are recorded as credits. 2.Liabilities: Increases in liabilities are recorded as credits. Decreases in liabilities are recorded as debits. 3.Owner’s Capital: Increases in owner’s capital are recorded as credits. Decreases in owner’s capital are recorded as debits. 4.Expenses: Increases in expenses are recorded as debits. Decreases in expenses are recorded as credits. 5.Revenue or Incomes: Increases in revenue or incomes are recorded as credits. Decreases in revenue or incomes are recorded as debits.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 73}, page_content=\"These rules are essential for maintaining the integrity of financial records and ensuring that all entries balance out in the ledgers. The terms debit and credit should not be taken to mean, respectively, favourable and unfavourable things. They merely describe the two sides of accounts. Whether an entry is to the debit or credit side of an asset depends on the type of account and the transactions ➢Increase in Purchases is debited and Increase in Sales is credited. ➢Increase in Expenses is debited and Increase in revenue and Incomes is credited. ➢Increase in Assets is debited and Increase in Liabilities and Owners' Capital is credited.  In the same way, decrease in purchases, expenses and assets are credits and decrease in sales, income, liabilities and owners' capital are debit. 1.5.TRANSACTIONS In the system of book-keeping, students can notice that transactions are recorded in the books of accounts. A transaction is a type of event, which is generally external in nature and can be determined in terms of money. In an accounting period, every business has huge number of transactions which are analysed in financial terms and then recorded individually, followed by classification and summarisation process, to know their impact on the financial statements. A transaction is a two-way process in which value is transferred from one party to another. In it either a party receives a value in terms of goods etc. and passes the value in terms of money or vice versa. Therefore, one can easily make out that in a transaction, a party receives as well as passes the value to other party. For recording transaction, it is very important that they are supported by a substantial document like purchase invoices, bills, payslips, cash-memos, passbook etc. Transactions analysed in terms of money and supported by proper documents are recorded in the books of accounts under double entry system. To analyse the dual aspect of each transaction, two approaches can be followed: 1)Accounting Equation Approach. 2)Traditional Approach. 1.6.ACCOUNTING EQUATION APPROACH The relationship of assets with that of liabilities and owners' equity in the equation form is known as 'Accounting Equation'. Basic accounting equation comes into picture when sum total of capital and liabilities equalises assets,\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 74}, page_content=\"where assets are what the business owns and capital and liabilities are what the business owes. Under double entry system, every business transaction has two-fold effect on the business enterprise where each transaction affects changes in assets, liabilities or capital in such a way that an accounting equation is completed and equated. This accounting equation holds good at all points of time and for any number of transactions and events except when there are errors in accounting process. Let us suppose that an individual started business by contributing ₹  and taking loan of ₹  f r o m  a  b a n k  t o  b e  r e p a y a b l e ,  a f t e r  5  y e a r s .  H e  purchased furniture costing ₹ , and merchandise worth ₹ . For purchasing the merchandise he paid ₹  to the suppliers and agreed to pay balance after 3 months. The contribution by the owner is termed as capital; the loans are termed as liabilities. Whenever the loan is repayable in the short-run, say within one year, it is called short-term loan or liability. On the other hand, if the loan is repayable atleast after one year, it would be termed as long term loan or liability. Some other short-term liabilities relating to credit purchase of merchandise are popularly called as trade payables, and for other purchases and services received on credit as expense payables. The short-term liabilities are also termed as current liabilities and long term liabilities are termed as non-current liabilities. On the other hand, money raised has been invested in two types of assets-fixed assets and current assets. Furniture is a fixed asset, if it lasts long, say more than one year, and has utility to the business, while inventory and cash balance will not remain fixed for long as soon as the business starts to roll-these are current assets. Often the owner's claim or fund in the business is called equity. Owner's claim implies capital invested plus any profit earned minus any loss incurred. Now we have an equation: Equity + Liabilities  Assets or, Equity + Long-Term Liabilities  Fixed Assets + Current Assets - Current Liabilities On the left-hand side (LHS), Equity is ₹5,000, Long-term Liabilities are ₹1,000, and Current Liabilities are ₹1,000, totaling ₹7,000 (in '000s). On the right-hand side (RHS), under Assets, Furniture (Fixed Asset) is ₹1,000, Inventory (Current Asset) is ₹5,000, and Cash is ₹1,000, totaling ₹7,000 (in '000s). 50,00,00010,00,00010,00,00050,00,00040,00,000\\n==\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 75}, page_content=\"Both sides balance at ₹7,000 (in '000s), which is a check for the accounting equation where Total Assets are equal to the sum of Liabilities and Owner's Equity.  Cash = Capital + Loan - Furniture - Payment to Trade payables (₹' 000 )  Let us use  and  to mean Equity, Liabilities and Assets respectively at . Thus the basic accounting equation becomes  or  (Eq. 1) (₹' 000 ) Now, let us suppose that at the end of period inventory valuing ₹ 2,500 is in hand, cash ₹ 2,000; trade payables ₹ 500; bank loan ₹ 1,000 (interest was properly paid); furniture ₹ 800 {₹ 200 is taken as loss of value due to use (also known as depreciation)}. So at  - Assets: Fixed assets, which include furniture, are valued at ₹800. Current assets, which consist of inventory and cash, are valued at ₹2,500 and ₹2,000 respectively, totaling ₹5,300 for current assets. Liabilities: Long-term liabilities are ₹1,000. Current liabilities are ₹500, summing up to ₹1,500 for total liabilities. Equity, which is the difference between total assets (A) and total liabilities (L), is calculated as ₹3,800.  Equity  Assets - Liabilities i.e.,  or  L e t u s c o m p a r e E 1 w i t h E 0 . E q u i t y i s r e d u c e d b y ₹ . Reduction in equity is termed as loss incurred.

On the other hand,  implies profit earned by business during  implies profit earned during  and so on. So if En> En-1, in general terms, equity has increased, while En< En-1 implies that equity has decreased. Increase in equity is termed as profit while decrease in equity is termed as loss. 1.7.TRADITIONAL APPROACH Under traditional approach of recording transactions one should first understand the term debit and credit and their rules. The term debit and credit have already been explained in para 1.4 of this Unit. Transactions in the journal are recorded on the basis of the rules of debit and credit only. For the purpose of recording, these transactions are classified in three groups: i.Personal transactions. ii.Transactions related to assets and properties. iii.Transactions related to expenses, losses, income and gains. 1.7.1.Classification of Accounts i.Personal Accounts: Personal accounts relate to persons, trade receivables or trade payables. Example would be the account of Ram & Co., a credit customer or the account of Jhaveri & Co., a supplier of goods. The capital account is the account of the proprietor and, therefore, it is also personal but adjustment on account of profits and losses are made in it. This account is further classified into three categories: a)Natural personal accounts: It relates to transactions of human beings like Ram, Rita, etc. b)Artificial (legal) personal accounts: For business purpose, business entities are treated to have separate entity. They are recognised as persons in the eye of law for dealing with other persons. For example: Government, Companies (private or limited), Clubs, Co-operative societies etc. c)Representative personal accounts: These are not in the name of any person or organisation but are represented as personal accounts. For example: outstanding liability account or prepaid account, capital account, drawings account. E2<E1t12E1>E0t01,E2>E1t21'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 77}, page_content='ii.Impersonal Accounts: Accounts which are not personal such as machinery account, cash account, rent account etc. These can be further sub-divided as follows: a)Real Accounts: Accounts which relate to assets of the firm but not debt. For example, accounts regarding land, building, investment, fixed deposits etc., are real accounts. Cash in hand and Cash at the bank accounts are also real. b)Nominal Accounts: Accounts which relate to expenses, losses, gains, revenue, etc. like salary account, interest paid account, commission received account. The net result of all the nominal accounts is reflected as profit or loss which is transferred to the capital account. Nominal accounts are, therefore, temporary. 1.7.2.Golden Rules of Accounting All the above classified accounts have two rules each, one related to Debit and one related to Credit for recording the transactions which are termed as golden rules of accounting, as transactions are recorded on the basis of double entry system. ➢Personal Account: Debit the receiver and credit the giver. ➢Real Account: Debit what comes in and credit what goes out. ➢Nominal Account: Debit expenses and losses and credit income and gains.  1.8.MODERN CLASSIFICATION OF ACCOUNTS Real, nominal and personal accounts is the traditional classification of accounts. Now, let us see the modern and more acceptable classification of accounts:- ➢Asset accounts have a normal debit balance and are debited when increased and credited when decreased. ➢Liabilities accounts have a normal credit balance and are credited when increased and debited when decreased. ➢Capital accounts have a normal credit balance and are credited when increased and debited when decreased. ➢Revenue accounts have a normal credit balance and are credited when increased and debited when decreased. ➢Expenditure accounts have a normal debit balance and are debited when increased and credited when decreased.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 78}, page_content='➢Withdraw accounts have a normal debit balance and are debited when increased and credited when decreased. In practice with the modern approach: ➢Cash, an asset, is debited to reflect an increase. ➢Capital, a liability, is credited to reflect an increase. ➢Wages/salaries paid, an expense, are debited to reflect an increase. ➢Cash, an asset, is credited to reflect a decrease. ➢Rent received, revenue, is credited to reflect an increase. ➢Purchase, an expense, is debited to reflect an increase. ➢Creditor, a liability, is credited to reflect an increase. ➢Cash, an asset, is debited to reflect an increase. ➢Sales, revenue, is credited to reflect an increase.  1.9.JOURNAL Transactions are first entered in this book to show which accounts should be debited and which credited. Journal is also called subsidiary book. Recording of transactions in journal is termed as journalizing the entries. It is the book of original entry in which transactions are entered on a daily basis in a chronological order. 1.9.1.Journalising Process All transactions may be first recorded in the journal as and when they occur; the record is chronological; otherwise it would be difficult to maintain the records in an orderly manner. Debits and credits are listed along with the appropriate explanations. There are basically two types of journals:- 1.General journal 2.Specialized journal The latter is used when there are many repetitive transactions of the same nature. The form of the journal is given below: JOURNAL'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 79}, page_content='Date (1): This column records the date on which the transaction occurred or was entered into the books of accounts. Particulars (2): This section details the nature of the transaction or the names of the accounts that are to be debited or credited. Ledger Folio (L.F.) (3): This column indicates the page number of the ledger where the corresponding account is maintained, facilitating quick reference. Amount Dr. (4): This represents the amount that is to be debited from the specified account on the given date. Amount Cr. (5): This column shows the amount that is to be credited to the specified account on the recorded date. Each entry in this row reflects a single financial transaction as recorded in the books of accounts. The columns have been numbered only to make clear the following but otherwise they are not numbered. The following points should be noted: 1)In the first column the date of the transaction is entered-the year is written at the top, then the month and in the narrow part of the column the particular date is entered. 2)In the second column, the names of the accounts involved are written; first the account to be debited, with the word \"Dr\" written towards the end of the column. In the next line, after leaving a little space, the name of the account to be credited is written preceded by the word \"To\" (the modern practice shows inclination towards omitting \"Dr.\" and \"To\"). Then in the next line the explanation for the entry together with necessary details is given-this is called narration. 3)In the third column the number of the page in the ledger on which the account is written up is entered. 4)In the fourth column the amounts to be debited to the various accounts concerned are entered. 5)In the fifth column, the amount to be credited to various accounts is entered. 1.9.2.Points to be taken into account while recording a transaction in the Journal 1.Journal entries can be single entry (i.e. one debit and one credit) or compound entry (i.e. one debit and two or more credits or two or more debits and one credit or two or more debits and credits). In such cases, it is important to check that the total of both debits and credits are equal. 2.If journal entries are recorded in several pages then both the amount column of each page should be totalled and the balance should be written'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 80}, page_content=\"at the end of that page and also that the same total should be carried forward at the beginning of the next page. An entry in the journal may appear as follows: May 5: Debit entry of ₹14,50,000 to Bank Account, credit entry of ₹14,50,000 to Mohan's account, reflecting the receipt of payment from Mohan against the outstanding amount due from him. We will now consider some individual transactions. i.Mohan commences business with ₹ 50,00,000 in his bank account. This means that the firm has ₹ 50,00,000 in bank. According to the rules given above, the increase in an asset has to be debited. The firm also now owes ₹  to the proprietor, Mohan as capital. The rule given above also shows that the increase in capital should be credited. Therefore, the journal entry will be: Debit entry to Bank Account of ₹50,00,000 and corresponding credit entry to Capital Account, denoting the introduction of capital by Mohan into the business. ii.Out of the above, ₹ 25,000 is withdrawn from the bank. By this transaction the bank balance is reduced by ₹ 25,000 and another asset, cash account, comes into existence. Since increase in assets is debited and decrease is credited, the journal entry will be: Debit entry of ₹25,000 to Cash Account and credit entry of ₹25,000 to Bank Account, reflecting a cash withdrawal from the bank. iii.Furniture is purchased for . Applying the same reasoning as above the entry will be: Debit entry to Furniture Account for ₹12,00,000 and corresponding credit entry to Bank Account, indicating the purchase of furniture. iv.Purchased goods for ₹ 4,00,000. The student can see that the required entry is: Debit entry to Purchases Account for ₹4,00,000 with a corresponding credit entry to Bank Account, signifying the purchase of goods. v.Purchased goods for ₹  on credit from M/s Ram Narain Bros. Purchase of merchandise is an expense item so it is to be debited. ₹  is now owing to the supplier; his account should therefore be credited, since the amount of liabilities has increased. The entry will be: Debit entry to Purchases Account for ₹10,00,000 and credit entry to M/s Ram Narain Bros., reflecting the purchase of goods on credit. 50,00,000\\n₹12,00,000\\n10,00,00010,00,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 81}, page_content=\"vi.Sold goods to M/s Ram & Co. for ₹ 6,00,000. Amount is received in cheque. The amount of bank increases and therefore, the bank amount should be debited; sale of merchandise is revenue item so it is to be credited. The entry will be: Debit entry to Bank Account for ₹6,00,000 and credit entry to Sales Account, representing the revenue from goods sold to M/s Ram & Co vii.Sold goods to Ramesh on credit for ₹ . The Inventories of goods has decreased and therefore, the goods account has to be credited. Ramesh now owes ₹ ; that is an asset and therefore, Ramesh should be debited. The entry is: Debit entry to Ramesh for ₹13,00,000 and a credit entry to Sales Account, recording the credit sale of goods to Ramesh. viii.Received cheque from Ramesh ₹ . The amount of bank increased therefore the bank account has to be debited. Ramesh's liability towards firm has decreased in fact in this case he no longer owes any amount to the firm now, i.e., this particular form of assets has disappeared; therefore, the account of Ramesh should be credited. The entry is: Debit entry of ₹13,00,000 to Bank Account and credit entry of the same amount to Ramesh's account, recording the receipt of a cheque from Ramesh against sales. ix.Paid rent ₹ 1,00,000. The bank balance has decreased and therefore, the bank account should be credited. No asset has come into existence because the payment is for services enjoyed and is an expense. Expenses are debited. Therefore, the entry should be: Rent expense of ₹1,00,000 recorded as a debit to Rent Account and a corresponding credit to Bank Account, representing payment of rent for the month. x.Paid ₹ 22,000 to the clerk as salary. Applying the reasons given in (x) above, the required entry is: Salary payment of ₹22,000 recorded as a debit to Salary Account and a credit to Bank Account, for salary paid to the clerk for the month. xi.Received ₹ 2,20,000 interest. The bank account should be debited since there is an increase in the bank balance. There is no increase in any liability; since the amount is not returnable to any one, the amount is an income, incomes are credited. The entry is: Receipt of ₹2,20,000 as interest income, recorded as a debit to Bank Account and a credit to Interest Account, for the interest received for the period. 13,00,00013,00,00013,00,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='When transactions of similar nature take place on the same date, they may be combined while they are journalised. For example, entries (  ) and (xi) may be combined as follows: Debit entries of ₹1,00,000 to Rent Account and ₹22,000 to Salary Account with a total credit of ₹1,22,000 to Bank Account, reflecting payment for expenses as detailed in the attached documentation. When journal entry for two or more transactions are combined, it is called composite journal entry. Usually, the transactions in a firm are so numerous that to record the transactions for a month will require many pages in the journal. At the bottom of one page the totals of the two columns are written together with the words \"Carried forward\" in the particulars column. The next page is started with the respective totals in the two columns with the words \"Brought forward\" in the particulars column. Conclusion: It is evident from above analysis that procedure for analysis of transactions, classification of accounts and rules for recording business transactions under accounting equation approach and traditional approach are different. But the accounts affected and entries entered/passed remains the same under both approaches. Thus, the recording of transactions in affected accounts on the basis of double entry system is independent of the method of analysis followed by a business enterprise. In other words, accounts to be debited and credited to record the dual aspect remains the same under both the approaches. 1.10.ADVANTAGES OF JOURNAL In journal, transactions recorded on the basis of double entry system, fetch the following advantages: 1.As transactions are recorded in chronological order, one can get complete information about the business transactions on timely basis. 2.Entries recorded in the journal are supported by a note termed as narration, which is a precise explanation of the transaction for the proper understanding of the entry. One can know about the transactions through these narrations. 3.Journal forms the basis for posting the entries in the ledger and reduces the chances of error. 1.11.ACCOUNTING FOR GST 1.11.1.Introduction to GST x'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 83}, page_content=\"Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a comprehensive Indirect Tax  which has subsumed multiple Indirect Taxes in India such as State Value added Tax (VAT) which was levied on sale of goods, Excise Duty, which was levied on manufacture or production of goods, Service Tax which was levied on provision of services etc. GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to consumer. •An indirect tax is a tax whose incidence is borne by the consumers who ultimately consume the product or service. The immediate liability to pay the tax may fall upon another person such as a manufacturer or provider of service or seller of goods, but the same is collected from the person purchasing the goods (recipient of goods or services). Pre-GST scenario: Prior to introduction of GST, the following duties were levied: a)On manufacture of goods: Excise Duty (levied by Central Government) b)On sale of goods within the State: State Value Added Tax (VAT) c)On sale of goods outside the State: Central Sales Tax (levied by Central Government) d)On provision of services provided: Service Tax (levied by Central Government) Since the taxes were levied by different authorities (central and state authorities), it was not possible to take the benefit of credit of taxes paid at different stages. For instance, when a trader received goods (say costing ₹ 1,00,000) from the manufacturer, excise duty (say @ 18%  ) was levied on the goods sold by the manufacturer. When such trader would sell the goods to the customer, he would charge VAT (assume 18%). However, the trader could not avail the benefit of the credit of the excise duty of  paid in respect of the goods purchased from the manufacturer. Accordingly, the 'cost' of the goods to the trader would be , on which the trader would add his profit margin and levy VAT while selling to the consumer. This created a scenario wherein a tax (in our example, VAT) was levied on the tax (in our example, excise duty) also, in addition to the tax levied on the goods. This cascading effect (tax-on-tax) increased the price of the product, and resulted in an unjust enrichment at the cost of the ultimate consumer. Post-GST scenario: On introduction of GST, the tax to be levied at all stages right from manufacture up to final consumption was a single tax- GST, with credit of taxes paid at \\xa0∗\\n=₹18,000₹18,000₹1,00,000+₹18,000=₹1,18,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 84}, page_content=\"previous stages available as setoff. Thus, in the example above, the GST (erstwhile excise duty) of ₹ 18,000 paid by the trader could be availed as a credit (an asset), for set off against the tax charged by the trader (a liability for the trader, which would be received from the consumer). Hence, the cost of the goods to the trader would be ₹  only, as ₹ 18,000 can be set off against the GST charged by the trader to the consumer. The tax levied by the manufacturer to the trader becomes 'input tax' for the trader, since the goods are purchased by him (it is his input). The tax levied by the manufacturer to the trader, or the trader to the consumer is known as 'output tax' (since it is output for both the manufacturer and trader) both for the manufacturer and trader. The 'input tax' cannot be added to the cost of the goods or services procured, as it will be adjusted against the 'output tax' liability. In a nutshell, since the input tax is availed as a credit, only the value addition (i.e., the profit margin levied by the trader to the consumer in our example) will be taxed, with the burden of tax being borne by the final consumer. 1.11.2.Salient features of GST •GST is levied on supply i.e., manufacture or sale of goods and provision of services. In other words, supply is taxable event which own its occurrence creates or attracts the liability to pay tax. •Under GST, tax in levied only the value added at each stage of the supply chain. •GST is a destination-based consumption tax, i.e. the tax is levied at the place where the goods or services are consumed, rather than the place where they are produced. •There is no tax on tax or cascading of taxes under GST system. •Under GST, there is a harmonization of laws, procedures and rates of tax across the country. 1.11.3.Types of Taxes under GST Before going through the types of taxes under GST, it is important to understand the concept of intra-State supply and inter-State supply under GST which determines the type of tax to be charged by the supplier. The Concept of intra-state supply and inter-state supply depends upon on the location of the supplier and place of supply (place of supply is the place where goods/services are consumed. As a general rule, where the location of the supplier and the place of supply of goods or services are in the same State/Union territory, it is treated as intra-State supply of goods or services respectively. 1,00,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 85}, page_content='Similarly, where the location of the supplier and the place of supply of goods or services are in (i) two different States or (ii) two different Union Territories or (iii) a State and a Union territory, it is treated as inter-State supply of goods or services respectively. GST has a dual aspect with the Centre and States simultaneously levying on a common tax base. There are three main components of GST which are: i.Central Goods and Service Tax (CGST) is levied and collected by the Centre on the \"Intra -State\" supply of goods and services. ii.State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) is levied and collected by the State Governments (including Union Territories with legislature, for example Delhi, Pondicherry, Jammu and Kashmir) on \"Intra state\" supply of goods and services iii.Union Territory Goods and Service Tax (UTGST) is levied and collected by Union Territories without Legislatures [i.e. Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Ladakh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli & Daman and Diu and Chandigarh] on \"intra-state\" supply of goods and services. iv.Integrated Goods and services tax (IGST): It is the GST levied on the \"inter state\" supply of goods and services and is collected by the Centre. IGST is equivalent to the sum total of CGST and SGST. GST is a \"Consumption Based Tax\" i.e. the tax is received by the State in which the goods or services are consumed and not by the state in which the goods and services are manufactured. Structure of Goods and Services Tax (GST) GST, a comprehensive indirect tax on the manufacture, sale, and consumption of goods and services, is classified into two categories: 1.Intra-State GST: This pertains to transactions within a single state and is further divided into two parts: Central GST (CGST): Levied by the Central Government. ·State GST (SGST): Levied by the State Government. 2.Inter-State GST: This applies to transactions between two states or a state and a union territory. It is known as: Integrated GST (IGST): Levied by the Central Government and shared with the states. This tax structure aims to create a single unified market by eliminating the cascading effect of taxes on goods and services across India. 1.11.4.Input and Output GST'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 86}, page_content='The tax paid by the recipient on procurement of goods /services is called Input tax. An entity at each stage is permitted to avail credit of GST paid on the purchase of goods and /or availment of services and can set off this credit against the GST payable on the goods and/or services supplied by him. Thus, the final consumer bears the GST charged in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages. Hence, the tax will be levied only on the value added, which results in avoiding double taxation. For example, if tax payable by a manufacturer on the output, i.e. final product is  and he has already paid tax on  on input, i.e. purchases, then he can claim \\'Input Credit\\' of ₹500 and he needs to deposit only ₹250 in cash. Output tax means the GST charged on supply of goods or services made by a supplier. Input tax means the credit of Input tax already paid. Utilisation of Input Tax Credit under GST Tax credit of CGST, SGST and IGST can be utilized in the following manner: •Utilization of IGST Credit: IGST credit has to be first utilized against IGST liability and if any balance is still available, the same can be utilized against CGST or/and SGST in any order and in any proportion. •Utilization of CGST Credit: CGST credit has to be first utilized against CGST liability and if any balance is available, same can be utilized against IGST. However, CGST credit cannot be utilized against SGST. •Utilization of SGST Credit: SGST credit has to be first utilized against SGST liability and if any balance is available, same can be utilized against IGST. However, SGST credit cannot be utilized against CGST. Input GST, which is credited, can be availed and is therefore an asset. It is debited to the \"Input GST Account\" at the time of goods or services purchase. Output GST, charged to the consumer and payable by the supplier, is credited to the \"Output GST Account\" and represents a liability. For intra-state transactions, the CGST paid is debited to \"Input CGST Account\" and SGST paid is debited to \"Input SGST Account,\" while the charged CGST and SGST are credited to their respective output accounts. For inter-state transactions, IGST paid is debited to \"Input IGST Account\" and charged IGST is credited to \"Output IGST Account.\" Reversal of GST is accounted for when goods are returned, used for drawings, distributed as free samples, or given as gifts not qualifying as a supply under GST. Finally, the input GST credit is denied for goods lost in fire or theft and for supplies not eligible to be availed by the recipient. Input GST Account is credited when tax is paid by utilizing input tax credit. ₹750₹500'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 87}, page_content='Double entry book-keeping with GST The Double entry book-keeping records need to show the GST values separately so that the purchases, expenses and sales are posted net i.e. without the addition of GST.

The book which contains all set of accounts (viz. personal, real and nominal accounts), is known as Ledger.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 89}, page_content=\"It is known as principal books of account in which account-wise balance of each account is determined. 2.2.SPECIMEN OF LEDGER ACCOUNTS A ledger account has two sides-debit (left side of the account) and credit (right side of the account). Each of the debit and credit side has four columns. (i) Date (ii) Particulars (iii) Journal folio i.e. page from where the entries are taken for posting and (iv) Amount. Dr. Account Cr. Date: This column is used to record the date when a financial transaction takes place. Particulars: This column describes the details of the transaction, including the accounts affected. J.F. (Journal Folio): This column refers to the page number in the journal where the transaction is recorded, for easy reference. Amount (₹): This column shows the monetary value of the transaction in Indian Rupees (₹). Each row in this table represents a separate entry in the accounting records. 2.3.POSTING The process of transferring the debit and credit items from journal to classified accounts in the ledger is known as posting. 2.3.1.Rules regarding Posting of Entries in the Ledger 1.Separate account is opened in ledger book for each distinct account and entries from Journal are posted to respective account accordingly. 2.It is a practice to use words 'To' and 'By' while posting transactions in the ledger. The word 'To' is used in the particular column with the accounts written on the debit side while 'By' is used with the accounts written in the particular column of the credit side. These 'To' and 'By' do not have any meanings but are used to the account debited and credited. 3.The concerned account debited in the journal should also be debited in the ledger but reference should be of the respective credit account. 2.4.BALANCING AN ACCOUNT At the end of each month or year or any particular reporting period, it may be necessary to ascertain the balance in an account. Suppose a person has bought goods worth ₹1,000 and has paid only ₹ 850; he owes ₹150 and that is the\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 90}, page_content='balance in his account. To ascertain the balance in any account, both the sides of the account is totalled and smaller amount is deducted from the bigger amount to ascertain the difference. If the credit side is bigger than the debit side, it is a credit balance and vice a versa. The credit balance is written on the debit side as, \"To Balance c/d\"; c/d means \"carried down\". By doing this, two sides will be equal. The totals are written on the two sides opposite one another. Then the credit balance is written on the credit side as \"By balance b/d (i.e., brought down)\". This is the opening balance for the new period. The debit balance similarly is written on the credit side as \"By Balance  \", the totals then are written on the two sides as shown above and then the debit balance written on the debit side as, \"To Balance b/d\", as the opening balance of the new period. It should be noted that nominal accounts are not balanced; the balance in the end are transferred to the profit and loss account. Only personal and real accounts balances are ultimately shown in the balance sheet at the end of the accounting period. The capital account is adjusted for profit or loss (i.e net of nominal accounts) at the end of accounting period. \\nUNIT 3 :  3.TRIAL BALANCE 3.1.INTRODUCTION c/d'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 91}, page_content='Preparation of trial balance is the third phase in the accounting process. After posting the accounts in the ledger, a statement is prepared to show separately the debit and credit balances. Such a statement is known as the trial balance. It may also be prepared by listing each and every account and entering in separate columns the totals of the debit and credit sides. Whichever way it is prepared, the totals of the two columns should agree. An agreement indicates arithmetic accuracy of the accounting work; if the two sides do not agree, then there is simply an arithmetic error(s). This follows from the fact that under the Double Entry System, the amount written on the debit sides of various accounts is always equal to the amounts entered on the credit sides of other accounts and vice versa. Hence the totals of the debit sides must be equal to the totals of the credit sides. Also total of the debit balances will be equal to the total of the credit balances. Once this agreement is established, there is reasonable confidence that the accounting work is free from clerical errors, though it is not a proof of cent per cent accuracy, because some errors of principle and compensating errors may still remain. Generally, to check the arithmetic accuracy of accounts, trial balance is prepared at monthly intervals. But because double entry system is followed, one can prepare a trial balance any time. Though a trial balance can be prepared any time but it is preferable to prepare it at the end of the reporting period which may be month end/quarter end/year end to ensure the arithmetic accuracy of all the accounts before the preparation of the financial statements. It may be noted that trial balance is a statement and not an account. 3.2. OBJECTIVES OF PREPARING THE TRIAL BALANCE The preparation of trial balance has the following objectives: i.Trial balance enables one to establish whether the posting and other accounting processes have been carried out without committing arithmetical errors. In other words, the trial balance helps to establish arithmetical accuracy of the books of accounts. ii.Financial statements are normally prepared on the basis of agreed trial balance; otherwise the financial statements will not give true and fair picture of the financial transactions. iii.The trial balance serves as a summary of what is contained in the ledger; the ledger may have to be seen only when details are required in respect of an account. The form of the trial balance is simple as shown below: Trial Balance as at…………….'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 92}, page_content='Serial Number (S.No): This column enumerates the entries for reference and order. Ledger Accounts: This column lists the names of the accounts that have been affected by the transactions. Debit Amount (Dr. Amount): This represents the total or balance amount that has been debited from the respective ledger accounts. Credit Amount (Cr. Amount): This column shows the total or balance amount that has been credited to the respective ledger accounts. Each entry records the financial position of an account in terms of total debits and credits. The under mentioned points may be noted: i.A trial balance is prepared as on a particular date which should be mentioned at the top. ii.In the second column the name of the account is written. iii.In the third column the total of the debit side of the account concerned or the debit balance, if any is entered. iv.In the fourth column, the total of the credit side or the credit balance is written. v.(v) The third and fourth columns are totalled at the end. 3.3.LIMITATIONS OF TRIAL BALANCE One should note that the agreement of Trial Balance is not a conclusive proof of accuracy. In other words, in spite of the agreement of the trial balance some errors may remain. These may be of the following types: i.Transaction has not been entered at all in the journal. ii.A wrong amount has been written in both columns of the journal. iii.A wrong account has been mentioned in the journal. iv.An entry has not at all been posted in the ledger. v.Entry is posted twice in the ledger. Still, the preparation of the trial balance is very useful; without it, the preparation of financial statements, would be difficult. 3.4.METHODS OF PREPARATION OF TRIAL BALANCE'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 93}, page_content='1.TOTAL METHOD Under this method, every ledger account is totalled and that total amount (both of debit side and credit side) is transferred to trial balance. In this method, trial balance can be prepared as soon as ledger account is totalled. Time taken to balance the ledger accounts is saved under this method as balance can be found out in the trial balance itself. The difference of totals of each ledger account is the balance of that particular account. This method is not commonly used as for the preparation of the financial statements, only net balance of the ledger account is required. Therefore, the trial balance compiled under this method cannot be used directly for preparation of the financial statements. 2.BALANCE METHOD Under this method, every ledger account is balanced and those balances only are carried forward to the trial balance. This method is used commonly by the accountants and helps in the preparation of the financial statements. Financial statements are prepared on the basis of the balances of the ledger accounts. 3.TOTAL AND BALANCE METHOD Under this method, the above two explained methods are combined. This has been explained with the help of the following example: Trial Balance of  as at 31.03.2022 Cash Account shows a debit balance of ₹7,500, with total debits amounting to ₹35,500 and credits totaling ₹28,000. Furniture Account has a debit balance of ₹3,000, represented entirely by the total debits with no credits. Salaries Account has a debit balance of ₹2,500, with no corresponding credit entries. Shyam’s Account has a credit balance of ₹3,500, with total debits of ₹21,500 and credits totaling ₹25,000. Purchases Account records total debits of ₹26,000, with no credits, reflecting the total amount spent on purchases. Purchase Returns Account has a credit balance of ₹500, indicating the value of purchases returned. Ram’s Account shows a credit balance of ₹25,100, with total debits of ₹4,900 against total credits of ₹30,000. X'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 94}, page_content='Sales Account has a credit balance of ₹30,500, which is the total income from sales with no debits. Sale Returns Account records a debit balance of ₹100, signifying the amount in sales that was returned. Capital Account shows a debit entry of ₹9,500 and a credit entry of ₹500, with a credit balance of ₹10,000. 3.5.ADJUSTED TRIAL BALANCE (THROUGH SUSPENSE ACCOUNT) If the trial balance does not agree after transferring the balance of all ledger accounts including cash and bank balance and also errors are not located timely, then the trial balance is tallied by transferring the difference of debit and credit side to an account known as suspense account. This is a temporary account opened to proceed further and to prepare the financial statements timely. 3.6.RULES OF PREPARING THE TRIAL BALANCE While preparing the trial balance from the given list of ledger balances, following rules should be taken into account: 1.The balances of all (i) assets accounts (ii) expenses accounts (iii) losses (iv) drawings are placed in the debit column of the trial balance. 2.The balances of all (i) liabilities accounts (ii) income accounts (iii) gains (iv) capital are placed in the credit column of the trial balance. Notes: 1.Dues from customers is an asset, so its balance will be a debit balance. 2.Purchases return account always shows a credit balance because assets go out. 3.Balance in Trade payables is a liability, so its balance will be a credit balance. 4.Bills payable is a liability, so its balance will be a credit balance. 5.Inventory (opening) represents assets, so it will have a debit balance. 6.Sales return account always shows a debit balance because assets come. UNIT - 4 SUBSIDIARY BOOKS 4.1 INTRODUCTION'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 95}, page_content='In a business, most of the transactions generally relate to receipts and payments of cash, sale of goods and their purchase. It is convenient to keep a separate register for each such class of transactions one for receipts and payments of cash, one for purchase of goods and one for sale of goods. A register of this type is called a book of original entry or of prime entry. The transactions recorded in such books will not require journal entries. The system by which transactions of a class are first recorded in the specified book, specially meant for it and on the basis of which ledger accounts are then prepared is known as the Practical System of Book keeping or even the English System. It should be noted that in this system, there is no departure from the rules of the double entry system. These books of original or prime entry are also called subsidiary books since ledger accounts are prepared on their basis without further processing of ledger posting. Normally, the following subsidiary books are used in a business: i.Cash Book to record receipts and payments of cash, including receipts into and payments out of the bank. ii.Purchases Book to record credit purchases of goods dealt in or of the materials and stores required in the factory. iii.Purchase Returns Book to record the returns of goods and materials previously purchased. iv.Sales Book to record the sales of the goods dealt in by the firm. v.Sale Returns Book to record the returns of goods made by the customers sold to them earlier. vi.Bills Receivable Book to record the receipts of promissory notes or hundies from various parties. vii.Bills Payable Book to record the issue of the promissory notes or hundies to other parties. viii.Journal (proper) to record the transactions which cannot be recorded in any of the seven books mentioned above. It may be noted that in all the above cases the word \"Journal\" may be used for the word \"book\". Advantages of Subsidiary Books The use of subsidiary books affords the undermentioned advantages:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 96}, page_content='i.Division of work: Since in the place of one journal there will be so many subsidiary books, the accounting work may be divided amongst a number of clerks. ii.Specialization and efficiency: When the same work is allotted to a particular person over a period of time, he acquires full knowledge of it and becomes efficient in handling it. Thus the accounting work will be done efficiently. iii.Saving of the time: Various accounting processes can be undertaken simultaneously because of the use of a number of books. This will lead to the work being completed quickly. iv.Availability of information: Since a separate register or book is kept for each class of transactions, the information relating to each class of transaction be available at one place. v.Facility in checking: When the trial balance does not agree, the location of the error or errors is facilitated by the existence of separate books. Even the commission of errors and frauds will be checked by the use of various subsidiary books.  4.2 DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUBSIDIARY BOOKS AND PRINCIPAL BOOKS The books in which transactions are first recorded to enable further processing are called subsidiary books. The ledger and the cash book are the principle books since they furnish information for preparation of the trial balance and financial statements. The following chart will help you in understanding the difference between Subsidiary Books and Principal Books. The structure of financial books of accounts. Here is the text representation of the content in the image, formatted in textbook language: Financial Books of Accounts The financial books of accounts are classified into two principal categories: 1.Principal Books 2.Subsidiary Books Principal Books include: ➢·Cash Books, which can be further subdivided into: ➢·Simple Cash Book'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 97}, page_content='➢·Cash Book with Discount Column ➢·Cash Book with Bank and Discount Column ➢·Petty Cash Book ➢·Ledger Subsidiary Books are used for specific transactions and include: ➢·For credit purchases: Purchase Book ➢·For credit sales: Sales Book ➢·For credit purchase returns: Purchase Return Book ➢·For credit sales returns: Sales Return Book ➢·For bills receivable received: Bill Received Book ➢·For bills accepted: Bill Payable Book ➢·For transactions not recorded elsewhere: Journal Proper Each of these books serves a specific purpose in the recording and management of financial transactions for a business. Principal books are used for recording all significant transactions involving cash and credit, while subsidiary books provide a detailed record of transactions that are specific to certain types of business activities This textbook-style text conveys the hierarchical structure and specific functions of the various financial books of accounts as depicted in the image. 4.3 PURCHASES BOOK To record the credit purchases of goods dealt in or materials used in the business, a separate register called the Purchases Book or the Purchases Journal, is usually maintained by firms. It should be remembered that: i.Cash purchases are not entered in this book since these will be entered in the cash book; and ii.Credit purchases of items other than goods or materials, such as office furniture or typewriters are journalised - they are not entered in the Purchases Book. The particulars column is meant to record the name of the supplier and name of the articles purchased and the respective quantities. The amount in respect of each article is entered in the details column. After totalling the various amounts'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 98}, page_content='included in a single purchase, the amount for packing, or other charges is added and the amount for trade discount is deducted. The net amount is entered in the amount column. The total in the amount column shows the total purchase made in a period. POSTING THE PURCHASES BOOK The Purchases Book shows the names of the parties from whom goods have been purchased on credit. These parties are now trade payables. Their accounts have to be credited for the respective amounts shown in the purchase book. The total of the amounts column shows the credit purchases made in a period. The amount is debited to the Purchase Account to indicate receipt of goods. In Illustration 1, the Purchases Account is debited by ₹ 5,022, M/s. Brown & Co. is credited by ₹ 3,042, The Paper Company by ₹1,800 and M/s. Verma Bros. by ₹ 180 . The total of the amounts put on the credit side equals the debit. Thus the double entry is completed. 4.4 SALES BOOK The Sales Book is a register specially kept to record credit sales of goods dealt in by the firm, cash sales are entered in the Cash Book and not in the Sales Book. Credit sales of items other than the goods dealt in by the firm are not entered in the Sales Book rather they are journalised. The rules are the same as for the Purchases Book. Entries in the Sales Book are also made in the same manner as in the Purchase Book. The particulars column will record the name of the customers concerned together with particulars and quantities of the goods sold. For each item, the amount is entered in the details column; after totalling the amounts for one sale, charges for packing etc; are added and the trade discount, if any is deducted: the net amount is put in the outer column. The total of this column will show the total credit sales for a period. POSTING THE SALES BOOK The names appearing in the Sales Book are of those parties which have received the goods. The accounts of the parties have to be debited with the respective amounts. The total of the Sales Book shows the credit sales made during the period concerned; the a mount is credited to the Sales Account. In the Illustration 3, ₹ 1,92,100 is credited to the Sales Account; ₹39,600 is debited to M/s. Gupta and Verma ₹40,000 to M/s Jain and Sons and ₹  to M/s Mathur & Jain. The amount put on the credit side is equal to the total of the amount put on the debit side. Thus, the double entry principle is followed correctly.  4.5 SALES RETURNS BOOK OR RETURNS INWARD BOOK 1,12,500'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 99}, page_content='If customers frequently return the goods sold to them, it would be convenient to record the returns in a separate book, which is named as the Sales Returns Book or the Returns Inward Book.

The following, assumed figures, will illustrate this: Returns Inward Book June 7, 2022: Sunil Bank & Co. was charged ₹37.80 for 6 copies of \"Double Entry Bookkeeping\" by T.S. Grewal at ₹7 each, after a trade discount of 10%, and Kailash & Co. was charged ₹3.50 for 1 copy of \"Business Methods\" by R.K. Gupta, totaling to an amount of ₹41.30. 4.6 PURCHASE RETURNS OR RETURNS OUTWARD BOOK Such a book conveniently records return of goods or material purchased to the suppliers. However, if the returns are not frequent, it may be sufficient to record the transaction in the journal. The rules of the Purchase Returns or Returns Outward Book is similar to that of the Purchase Book; entries are also similarly made, as the illustration given below shows: Returns Outward Book June 2, 2022: Premier Electric Co. was charged ₹175.00 for one 36\" Usha Ceiling Fan. June 28, 2022: Mohan Electric Co. was charged a net amount of ₹135.00 for ten Iron Heaters, after a discount of ₹15.00 on the original total of ₹150.00. The combined total for the transactions is ₹310.00. POSTING OF THE RETURN BOOKS The Sales Return Book will show the total of the returns made by customers. The total of the sales returns is in reduction of the sales. Therefore, the amount may be debited to the Sales Account but, usually, a separate account called Returns Inward Account is opened and the total of the sales returns is debited to this accounts. The customers who have returned the goods are credited with the respective amounts. It should be noted that on goods being received and accepted back from the customers, a credit note is issued to the customers concerned. This shows the amount to be credited to the customer\\'s account.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 100}, page_content='Similarly, when goods are returned to suppliers they will issue the necessary credit note; also the firm returning the goods will issue a debit note to the supplier, indicating the amount for which the supplier account is being debited. The total of Returns Outwards Book shows the total purchase returns made. The amount can be credited to the Purchase Account, but in practice, it is credited to a separate account called Purchase Returns or Returns Outward Account. The suppliers whose names appear in the Book have received the goods, so their accounts are debited. This is shown in the illustration given below: BILLS RECEIVABLE BOOKS AND BILLS PAYABLE BOOKS If the firm usually receives a number of promissory notes or hundies, it would be convenient to record the transaction in a separate book called the Bills Receivable Book. Similarly, if promissory notes or hundies are frequently issued, the Bills Payable Book will be convenient. This will be discussed later.  4.7 IMPORTANCE OF JOURNAL Students are now familiar with the journal. They also know that : i.Cash transactions are recorded in the cash book; ii.Credit purchases of goods or materials are recorded in the purchases book; iii.Credit sales of goods are recorded in the sales book; iv.Returns from customers are recorded in the sale returns book; and v.Returns to suppliers are entered in the purchase returns book. Bill received or accepted transactions are entered in the bills receivable books or the bills payable books, if these are maintained. Apart from the transactions mentioned above, there are other entries also which have to be recorded. For them the proper place is the journal. In fact, if there is no special book meant to record a transaction, it is recorded in the journal (proper). The role of the journal is thus restricted to the following types of entries: i.Opening entries: When books are started for the new year, the opening balance of assets and liabilities are journalised. ii.Closing entries : At the end of the year, the profit and loss account is prepared. For this purpose, the nominal accounts are transferred to profit and loss account. This is done through journal entries called closing entries. iii.Rectification entries: If an error has been committed, it is rectified through a journal entry.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 101}, page_content=\"iv.Transfer entries: If some amount is to be transferred from one account to another, the transfer will be made through a journal entry. v.Adjusting entries : At the end of the year the amount of expenses or income may have to be adjusted for amounts received in advance or for amounts not yet settled in cash. Such an adjustment is also made through journal entries. Usually, the entries pertain to the following: a.Outstanding expenses, i.e., expenses incurred but not yet paid; b.Prepared expenses, i.e., expenses paid in advance for future period; c.Interest on capital, i.e., the interest on proprietor's investment in the business; and d.Depreciation, i.e., fall in the value of the assets used on account of wear and tear. For above type of transactions/events, journal entries are necessary. vi.Entries on dishonour of Bills : If someone who accepted a promissory note (or bill) is not able to pay in on the due date, a journal entry will be necessary to record the nonpayment or dishonour of bills. vii.Miscellaneous entries :  T h e  f o l l o w i n g  e n t r i e s  w i l l  a l s o  r e q u i r e  journalising: a)Credit purchase of items other than goods dealt in or materials required for production of goods e.g. credit purchase of furniture or machinery will be journalised. b)An allowance to be given to the customers or a charge to be made to them after the issue of the invoice. c)Receipt or issue of promissory notes, if separate bill books have not been maintained. d)If an amount becomes irrecoverable, say, because, of the customer becoming insolvent. e)Effects of accidents such as loss of property by fire. f)Transfer of net profit to capital account.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 102}, page_content='UNIT 5 : CASH BOOK 5.1 CASH BOOK - A SUBSIDIARY BOOK AND A PRINCIPAL BOOK Cash transactions are straightaway recorded in the Cash Book and on the basis of such a record, ledger accounts are prepared. Therefore, the Cash Book is a subsidiary book. But the Cash Book itself serves as the cash account and the bank account; the balances are entered in the trial balance directly. The Cash Book, therefore, is part of the ledger also. Hence, it has also to be treated as the principal book. The Cash Book is thus both a subsidiary book and a principal book.  5.2 KINDS OF CASH BOOK The main Cash Book may be of the three types: (i) Simple Cash Book; (ii) Two-column Cash Book; (iii) Three-column Cash Book. In addition to the main Cash Book, firms also generally maintain a petty cash book but that is purely a subsidiary book. SIMPLE CASH BOOK Such a cash book appears like an ordinary account, with one amount column on each side. The left-hand side records receipts of cash and the right-hand side the payments. Balancing: The cash book is balanced like other accounts. The total of receipts column is always greater than total of payments column. The difference is written on the credit side as \\'By balance  \\'. The totals are then entered in the two columns opposite one another and then on the debit side the balance is written as \"To Balance b/d\", to show cash balance in hand in the beginning of next period. DOUBLE-COLUMN CASH BOOK If along with column for \"Amount\" to record cash receipts and cash payments another column is added on each side to record the cash discount allowed or the discount received, or a column on the debit side showing bank receipts and another column on the credit side showing payments through bank. It is a double-column cash book. c/d'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 103}, page_content='Cash discount is an allowance which often accompanies cash payments. For example, if a customer owes ₹ 500 but is promised that  will be deducted if payment is made within a certain period, the customer can clear his account by paying promptly ₹ 490 . Cash received will be  and  will be the discount for the firm receiving the payment and discount is a loss; for the person making the payment it is a gain. Since cash discount is allowed only if cash is paid, it is convenient to add a column for discount allowed on the receipt side of the cash book and a column for discount received on the payment side of the cash book. Balancing: It should be noted that the discount columns are not balanced. They are merely totalled. The total of the discount column on the receipts side shows total discount allowed to customers and is debited to the Discount Account. The total of the column on the payments side shows total discount received and is credited to the Discount Account. The Cash columns are balanced, as already shown. The bank columns are also balanced and the balancing figure is called bank balance. Thus a double column cash book should have two columns on each side comprising of either cash and discount transaction or cash and bank transactions. In the cash column on the debit side, actual cash received is entered; the amount of the discount allowed, if any, to the customer concerned is entered in the discount column. Similarly, actual cash paid is entered in the cash column on the payments side and discount received in the discount column. Also the bank column on the debit side records all receipts through bank and the same column on the credit side shows payment through bank. Note: The person who pays, is credited by both the cash paid by him and the discount allowed to him. Similarly, the person to whom payment is made, is debited with both the amount paid and the discount allowed by him. THREE-COLUMN CASH BOOK A firm normally keeps the bulk of its funds at a bank; money can be deposited and withdrawn at will if it is current account. Probably payments into and out of the bank are more numerous than strict cash transactions. There is only a little difference between cash in hand and money at bank. Therefore, it is very convenient if, on each side in the cash book, another column is added to record cash deposited at bank (on the receipt side of the cash book) and payments out of the bank (on the payment side of the cash book). For writing up the three-column cash book the under mentioned points should be noted: 1.While commencing a new business, the amount is written in the cash column if cash is introduced and in the bank column if it is directly put into the bank with the description \"To Capital Account\". If a new cash book is being started 2%₹490₹10'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 104}, page_content='for an existing business, the opening balances are written as: \"To Balance b/d\". 2.All receipts are written on the receipts side, cash in the cash column and cheques in the bank column. If any discount is allowed to the party paying the amount, the discount is entered in the discount column. In the particulars column the name of the account in respect of which payment has been received is written. 3.All payments are written on the payments side, cash payment in the cash column and payments by cheques in the bank column. If some discount has been received from the party receiving the payment, it is entered in the discount column. 4.Contra Entries: Often cash is withdrawn from bank for use in the office. In such a case the amount is entered in the bank column on the payments side and also in the cash column on the receipts side. In the reverse case of cash being sent to the bank, the amount is recorded in the bank column on the receipts side and in cash column on payment side. Against such entries, the letter \"  \" should be written in the L.F column, to indicate that these are contra transaction and no further posting is required for them. Note: If initially cheques received are entered in the cash column and then sent to the bank, the entry is as if cash has been sent to the bank. While recording contra entries, the basic but important rules should be followed - (a) The Receiver                   Dr. The Giver                               Cr. (b) All what comes in          Dr. All what goes out                 Cr. e.g. where a Cash Book with separate columns for Bank Account is maintained. a)If cash is deposited in Bank Account, the Bank will be the Receiver, hence it will be Debited and as the cash is going out, cash will be credited. b)If cash is withdrawn from the Bank Account, the Bank will be the Giver, hence it will be Credited and, as the cash is coming in, cash will be Debited. 5.If some cheque sent to the bank is dishonoured, i.e., the bank is not able to collect the amount, it is entered in the bank column on the credit side with the name of the concerned party in the particulars column. 6.If some cheque issued by the firm is not paid on presentation, it is entered in the Bank column on the debit side with the name of the party to whom the cheque was given. C'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 105}, page_content='7.In a rare case, a cheque received may be given to some other party, i.e., endorsed. On receipt, it must have been entered in the bank column on the debit side; on endorsement the amount will be written in the bank column on the credit side. The advantages of such type of Cash Book are that - a)the Cash Account and the Bank Account are prepared simultaneously, therefore the double entry is completed in the Cash Book itself. Thus the contra entries can be easily cross-checked in Cash column in one side and the Bank column in the other side of the Cash Book. Also the chances of error are reduced. b)the information regarding Cash in Hand and the Bank Balance can be obtained very easily and quickly as there is no need to prepare Ledger of the Bank Account. In case of maintaining more than one Bank Account, separate column can be add for each Bank Account. Transactions between these two or more Bank Accounts can be recorded and tallied with a much less effort. Suppose, there are two Bank Accounts namely PNB Current Account and SBI-Cash Credit Account. Now, if a cheque is issued from PNB cheque Book to SBI Account, the receiver - i.e., SBI Account will be debited and the giver i.e. the PNB Account shall be credited. Balancing: The discount columns are totalled but not balanced. The cash columns are balanced exactly in the same manner as indicated for the simple cash book. The process is similar for balancing the bank columns also. It is possible, however, that the bank may allow the firm to withdraw more than the amount deposited i.e., to have an overdraft, In such a case, the total of the bank column on the credit side is bigger than the one on the debit side. The difference is written on the debit side as \"To Balance c/d.\" Then the totals are written on the two sides opposite one another, the balance is then entered on the credit side as \"By Balance b/d.\" However, in usual cases debits into the bank will exceed the withdrawals or payments out of the bank. Then the bank columns are balanced just like the cash columns. 5.3 POSTING THE CASH BOOK ENTRIES Students would have seen that the cash columns in the cash book is actually the cash account and the bank column is actually bank account. Also, the discount columns are memorandum columns, meant only to provide information about the total discount allowed and total discount received.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 106}, page_content='The debit side columns for cash and bank indicate receipts. Therefore, the amounts debited in the cash book should be put to the credit of the account in respect of which cash or cheque has been received. For instance, in the cash book given above we see that ₹175 have been received for sale of goods. For posting, the amount is credited to the Sales Account as \"By Cash ₹175.\" We also see M/s. Warsi have paid ₹450 and also they have been allowed ₹ 35 as discount; thus they have discharged a debt of ₹485. In the account of M/s. Warsi, the posting is on the credit side as By Cash ₹ 450 By Discount ₹ 35 or as:  By Sundries ₹ 485 All payments are recorded on the credit side. The particulars columns show on what account payments have been made. In the ledger accounts concerned the amount is put on the debit side. For example, the cash book shows that a cheque for ₹ 330 has been issued to M/s. Ratan & Co. and also that they have allowed a discount of ₹ 20; thus an obligation of  has been met. In the account of M/s. Ratan & Co. the posting is: To Bank ₹ 330 To Discount  Or  To Sundries ₹ 350 The rule thus develops: From the debit side of the cash book, credit the various accounts with their respective amounts (including any discount that may have been allowed); from the credit side of cash book, the posting will be to the debit of the accounts mentioned in the particular column with their respective amounts (including the discount which may have been received). As has been shown already, the total of the discount columns on the debit side is debited to the discount account; the total of the column discount on the credit side is credited to the discount account. From the cash book given on the previous page ₹ 35 is debited and ₹ 20 be credited to the discount account. 5.4 PETTY CASH BOOK In the firm a number of small payments, such as for telegrams, taxi fare, cartage, etc., have to be made. If all these payments are recorded in the cash book, it will become unnecessarily heavy. Also, the main cashier will be overburdened with work. Therefore, it is usual for firms to appoint a person as \\'Petty Cashier\\' and to entrust the task of making small payments say below ₹ 200, to him. Of course he ₹350'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 107}, page_content='will be reimbursed for the payments made. Later, on an analysis, the respective account may be debited. IMPREST SYSTEM OF PETTY CASH It is convenient to entrust a definite sum of money to the petty cashier in the beginning of a period and to reimburse him for payments made at the end of the period. Thus, he will have again the fixed amount in the beginning of the new period. Such a system is known as the imprest system of petty cash. The system is very useful specially if an analytical Petty Cash Book is used. The book has one column to record receipt of cash (which is only from the main cashier) and other columns to record payments of various types. The total of the various columns show why payments have been made and then the relevant accounts can be debited. i.The amount fixed for petty cash should be sufficient for the likely small payments for a relatively short period, say for a week or a fortnight. ii.The reimbursement should be made only when petty cashier prepares a statement showing total payments supported by vouchers, i.e., documentary evidence and should be limited to the amount of actual disbursements. iii.The vouchers should be filed in order. iv.No payment should be made without proper authorisation. Also, payments above a certain specified limit should be made only by the main cashier. v.The petty cashier should not be allowed to receive any cash except for reimbursement. In the petty cash book the extreme left-hand column records receipts of cash. The money column towards the right hand side shows total payments for various purposes; a column is usually provided for sundries to record infrequent payments. The sundries column is analysed. At the end of the week or the fortnight the petty cash book is balanced. The method of balancing is the same as for the simple cash book. ADVANTAGES OF PETTY CASH BOOK There are mainly three advantages: i.Saving of time of the chief cashier; ii.Saving in labour in writing up the cash book and posting into the ledger; and'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 108}, page_content=\"iii.Control over small payments. POSTING THE PETTY CASH BOOK In the ledger, a petty cash account is maintained, when an amount is given to the petty cashier, the petty cash account is debited. Each week or forthnight, the total of the payments made is credited to this account. The petty cash account will then show the balance in the hand of the cashier; on demand he should be able to produce it for counting. At the end of the period/year, the balance is shown in the balance sheet as part of cash balance. Of course, the payments must be debited to their respective accounts as shown by the petty cash book. For this two methods may be used: i.From the petty cash book the total of the various columns may be directly debited to the concerned accounts; or ii.A journal entry may first be prepared on the basis of the petty cash book, debiting the accounts shown by the various analysis columns, and crediting the total of the payment of the petty cash accounts. Note: If the received cheque is endorsed to the other party on the same day, then no entry is required. However, in the above case posting has been done through cash column as the endorsement is done on next day. 5.5 ENTRIES FOR SALE THROUGH CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS Now-a-days sales through Credit/Debit Cards are issued by almost every Bank in India either directly or with collaboration of some other agencies. HSBC Card, SBI Card, BOB Card, ICICI Bank Card, HDFC Card and Andhra Bank Card are some of the popular Cards. The procedure for issuing Credit/Debit Cards are as follows - 1.A small Plastic Card, called Credit Card is issued by the bank to a prospective customer, after verifying his credibility, which is generally measured by his income sources. Debit Card is issued by bank to a customer who has an account with the bank. Now a days ATM Card issued by the bank can also be used as Debit Card. This card would contain an embossed 16 digit number and also the name of the cardholder. 2.Generally Bank charges annual subscription fees from the credit card holder. No fee is charged in case of Debit Card, though some banks charge a nominal fee on Debit Card also. 3.When the Card holder intends to buy some goods or services through Credit or Debit Card, the seller insert the customer's debit/credit card in the card\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 109}, page_content=\"machine and inputs the amount of sales and gives back to customers for feeding the password (i.e Personal Identification Number - PIN) for authorising the transactions. One copy of the receipt is given to the customer and other once is kept by the sellier for its record. 4.The seller sums up the different amounts sold like this and submits, generally everyday, to his bank all the forms. The amount is credited by the bank to the seller's account and debited to the account of the Bank or the company issuing the Credit/Debit Card. 5.The bank issuing the Card, charges commission for each such transaction, which varies between  t o   and is immediately debited to seller's bank account. 6.The bank sends a monthly statement to the card holder. In case of Debit Card the account is immediately debited to the card holder's account, whereas in case of Credit Card, card holder has to pay the amount in full or part. However, if not paid in full, the interest is charged. ACCOUNTING FOR CREDIT/DEBIT CARD SALE From the seller's point of view, this type of sale is equivalent to a cash sale. Commission charged by the bank will be treated as selling expenses. The following journal entries will be made in the seller's books of accounts. 1.Bank                                         Dr. To Sales Account (Sales made through Credit/Debit Card) 2.Commission Account                  Dr. To Bank Account (Commission charged by bank) 1%4%\\nA/c\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 110}, page_content='UNIT 6 : RECTIFICATION OF ERRORS 6.1 INTRODUCTION Unintentional omission or commission of amounts and accounts in the process of recording the transactions are commonly known as errors. These various unintentional errors can be committed at the stage of collecting financial information/data on the basis of which financial statements are drawn or at the stage of recording this information. Also errors may occur as a result of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in applying accounting policies, misinterpretation of facts, or oversight. To check the arithmetic accuracy of the journal and ledger accounts, trial balance is prepared. If the trial balance does not tally, then it can be said that there are errors in the accounts which require rectification thereof. Some of these errors may affect the Trial Balance and some of these do not have any impact on the Trial Balance although such errors may affect the determination of profit or loss, assets and liabilities of the business. Illustrative Case of Errors and their Nature We have seen that after preparing ledger accounts a trial balance is taken out where debit and credit balances are separately listed and totalled. If the totals of debit and credit do not agree, it is definite that there are some errors We shall now study the types of errors which may be committed and how they may be rectified. For this purpose, the working of the following illustrative cases should be carefully seen. Illustrative Cases of Errors a)Wrong Entry: Let us start from the first phase of the accounting process. Where wrong amount of transactions and events are recorded in the subsidiary books, Journal Proper and Cash Book. b)Wrong casting of subsidiary books: Subsidiary books are totalled periodically and posted to the appropriate ledger accounts. There may be'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 111}, page_content=\"totalling errors. Totalling errors may arise due to wrong entry or simply these may be independent errors. c)In case of cash book, wrong castings will result in wrong calculation of the balance c/d. d)Wrong posting from subsidiary books: In this case, the wrong amount may be posted to the ledger account or the amount may posted to the wrong side or to the wrong account. For example, purchases from A may be posted to B's account. e)Wrong casting of ledger balances: Likewise Cash Book, any ledger account balance may be casted wrongly. Obviously wrong postings make the balance wrong; but that is not wrong casting of balances. Whenever there arises independent casting error as in the case of bank column in the Cash Book of example (4), that is called wrong casting to ledger balances. 6.2 STAGES OF ERRORS Errors may occur at any of the following stages of the accounting process: AT THE STAGE OF RECORDING THE TRANSACTIONS IN JOURNAL Following types of errors may happen at this stage: i.Errors of principle, ii.Errors of omission, iii.Errors of commission. AT THE STAGE OF POSTING THE ENTRIES IN LEDGER i.Errors of omission: a)Partial omission, b)Complete omission. ii.Errors of commission: a)Posting to wrong account, b)Posting on the wrong side, c)Posting of wrong amount.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 112}, page_content='AT THE STAGE OF BALANCING THE LEDGER ACCOUNTS i.Wrong Totalling of accounts, ii.Wrong Balancing of accounts. AT THE STAGE OF PREPARING THE TRIAL BALANCE i.Errors of omission, ii.Errors of commission: a)Taking wrong account, b)Taking wrong amount, c)Taking to the wrong side. Accounting errors can be categorized into four broad types: Errors of Principle, Errors of Omission, Errors of Commission, and Compensating Errors. 6.3 TYPES OF ERRORS Basically errors are of two types: (a)Errors of principle: When a transaction is recorded in contravention of accounting principles, like treating the purchase of an asset as an expense, it is an error of principle. In this case, there is no effect on the trial balance since the amounts are placed on the correct side, though in a wrong account. Suppose on the purchase of a computer, the office expenses account is debited; the trial balance will still agree. (b)Clerical errors: These errors arise because of mistake committed in the ordinary course of the accounting process. These are of three types: i.Errors of Omission: If a transaction is completely or partially omitted from the books of account, it will be a case of omission. Examples would be: not recording a credit purchase of furniture or not posting an entry into the ledger. ii.Errors of Commission: If an amount is posted in the wrong account or it is written on the wrong side or the totals are wrong or a wrong balance is struck, it will be a case of \"errors of commission.\" iii.Compensating Errors: If the effect of errors committed cancel out, the errors will be called compensating errors. The trial balance will agree. Suppose an amount of ₹10 received from  is not credited to his account and A'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 113}, page_content=\"the total of the sales book is ₹ 10 in excess. The omission of credit to A's account will be made up by the increased credit to the Sales Account. From another point of view, error may be divided into two categories: a)Those that affect the trial balance - because of these errors, trial balance does not agree; these are the following: i.Wrong casting of the subsidiary books. ii.Wrong balancing of an account.  iii.Posting an amount on the wrong side. iv.Posting the wrong amount. v.Omitting to post an amount from a subsidiary book. vi.Omitting to post the totals of subsidiary book. vii.Omitting to write the cash book balances in the trial balance. viii. Omitting to write the balance of an account in the trial balance. ix.Writing a balance in wrong column of the trial balance. x.Totalling the trial balance wrongly. b)The errors that do not affect the trial balance are the following: i.Omitting an entry altogether from the subsidiary book. ii.Making an entry with the wrong amount in the subsidiary book. iii.Posting an amount in a wrong account but on the correct side, e.g., an amount to be debited to  is debited to , the trial balance will still agree. Classification of Accounting Errors In accounting, errors can be categorized into two main types: Error of Principal and Clerical Errors. These errors have different implications on the trial balance, which is a statement that lists the balances of all ledger accounts to verify the arithmetic accuracy of the books. 1.Error of Principal: This occurs when a transaction is recorded against the fundamental principles of accounting, such as treating revenue expenses as capital expenditure or vice versa, or recording the sale of a fixed asset as an AB\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 114}, page_content='ordinary sale. Despite this error, the Trial Balance will still agree because the entries are made on both sides of accounts. 2.Clerical Errors: These are mistakes made by a bookkeeper in the accounting process and are further divided into: a.Errors of Omission: When a transaction is not recorded at all, it is an error of omission. Within this category: If an entry is completely omitted from the subsidiary books, the Trial Balance will agree. If posting to the ledger account from the subsidiary books is omitted, the Trial Balance will not agree. b.Errors of Commission: These include: Writing the wrong amount in the subsidiary books, which will still result in the Trial Balance agreeing. Wrong casting (tallying) of the subsidiary books, posting the wrong amount in the ledger, or posting an amount on the wrong side of an account will result in the Trial Balance not agreeing. c.Compensating Errors: These are multiple errors that counterbalance each other, resulting in no discrepancy in the Trial Balance. Understanding the nature of these errors is crucial for accountants, as it helps in locating them and taking appropriate corrective measures. Identifying whether the Trial Balance agrees or not can be an initial step in error detection. This text provides a structured explanation of accounting errors based on their  6.4 STEPS TO LOCATE ERRORS Even if there is only a very small difference in the trial balance, the errors leading to it must be located and rectified. A small difference may be the result of a number of errors. The following steps will be useful in locating errors: i.The two columns of the trial balance should be totalled again. If in place of a number of accounts, only one amount has been written in the trial balance the list of such accounts should be checked and totalled again. List of Trade receivables is the example from which Trade receivable balance is derived. ii.It should be seen that the cash and bank balances have been written in the trial balance.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 115}, page_content='iii.The exact difference in the trial balance should be established. The ledger should be gone through again; it is possible that a balance equal to the difference has been omitted from the trial balance. The difference should also be halved; it is possible that balance equal to half the difference has been written in the wrong column. iv.The ledger accounts should be balanced again. v.The casting of subsidiary books should be checked again, especially if the difference is ₹ 1 , ₹ 100 etc. vi.If the difference is very big, the balance in various accounts should be compared with the corresponding accounts in the previous period. If the figures differ materially, those cases should be further scrutinised; it is possible that an error has been committed. Suppose the sales account for the current year shows a balance of  whereas it was ₹ 36,45,000 last year; it is possible that there is an error in the Sales Account. vii.Postings of the amounts equal to the difference or half the difference should be checked. It is possible that an amount has been omitted to be posted or has been posted on the wrong side. viii.If there is still a difference in the trial balance, a complete checking will be necessary. The posting of all the entries including the opening entry should be checked. It may be better to begin with the nominal accounts. 6.5 RECTIFICATION OF ERRORS Errors should never be corrected by overwriting. The correction should be made by making another suitable entry, called as rectification entry. In fact the rectification of an error depends on at which stage it is detected. An error can be detected at any one of the following stages: a)Before preparation of Trial Balance. b)After Trial Balance but before the final accounts are drawn. c)After final accounts, i.e., in the next accounting period. 6.5.1 Before preparation of Trial Balance There are some errors which affect one side of an account or which affect more than one account in such a way that it is not possible to pass a complete rectification entry. In other words, there are some errors which can be corrected, if detected at this stage, by making rectification statement in the appropriate side(s) of concerned account(s). It is important to note here that such errors may involve only one account or more than one account. Read the following illustrations: ₹32,53,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 116}, page_content='i.The sales book for November is undercast by ₹ 200. The effect of this error is that the Sales Account has been credited short by ₹ 200. Since the account is posted by the total of the sales book, there is no error in the accounts of the customers since they are posted with amounts of individual sales. Hence only the Sales Accounts is to be corrected. This will be done by making an entry for ₹ 200 on the credit side: \"By undercasting of Sales Book for November ₹ 200\". ii.While posting the discount column on the debit side of the cash book the discount of ₹ 10 allowed to Ramesh has not been posted. There is no error in the cash book, the total of discount column presumably has been posted to the discount account on the debit side. The error is in not crediting Ramesh by ₹ 10 . This should now be done by the entry \"By omission of posting of discount on ----- ₹10\". iii.₹ 200 received from Ram has been entered by mistake on the debit side of his account. Since the cash book seems to have been correctly written, the error is only in the account of Ram - he should have been credited and not debited by ₹ 200 . Not only the wrong debit is to be removed but also a credit of ₹ 200 is to be given. This can be done now by entering ₹ 400 on the credit side of his account. The entry will be \"By Posting on the wrong side - ₹ 400\". iv.₹ 50 was received from Mahesh and entered on the debit side of the cash book but was not posted to his account. By the error, which affects only the account of Mahesh, ₹ 50 has been omitted from the credit side of his account. The rectification will be by the entry. \"By Omission of posting on the ₹ 50.\" v.₹ 51 paid to Mohan has been posted as ₹15 to the debit of his account. Mohan has been debited short by ₹ 36 . The rectifying entry is \"To mistake in posting on ₹ 36 \". vi.Goods sold to Ram for ₹1,000 was wrongly posted from sales day book to the debit of purchase account. Ram has however been correctly debited. Here the error affects two accounts, viz., purchases account and sales account but we cannot pass a journal entry for its rectification because both the accounts need to be credited. The rectification will be done by the entry \"By wrong posting on  \" in the credit of purchases account and also \"By omission of posting on - ₹ 1,000\" in the credit sales account. vii.Bills receivable from Mr. A of ₹ 500 was posted to the credit of Bills payable Account and also credited to A account. Here also although two accounts are involved we cannot pass a complete journal entry for rectification. The rectification will be done by the entry \"To wrong posting on ₹ 500\" in debit of Bills payable Account and also \"To omission of posting on ₹ 500 \" in the debit of Bills Receivable Account. ₹1,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 117}, page_content='viii.Goods purchased from Vinod for ₹ 1,000 was wrongly credited to Vimal account by ₹ 100. Again we cannot pass a complete journal entry for rectification even though two accounts are involved. The rectification will be done by the entry \"To wrong posting on  \" in the debit of Vimal account and \"By omission of posting on  \" in the credit of Vinod account. Thus, from the above illustrations, it is clear that the general rule of errors affecting two accounts can be corrected by a journal entry does not hold true always. 6.5.2 After Trial Balance but before Final Accounts The method of correction of error indicated so far is appropriate when the errors have been located before the end of the accounting period. After the corrections, the trial balance will agree. Sometimes the trial balance is artificially made to agree despite of errors by opening a suspense account and putting the difference in the trial balance to the account - the suspense account will be debited if the total of the credit column in the trial balance exceeds the total of the debit column and vice as versa. One must note that such agreement of the trial balance is not real. Effort must be made to locate the errors. The rule of rectifying errors detected at this stage is simple. Those errors for which complete journal entries were not possible in the earlier stage of rectification (i.e., before trial balance) can now be rectified by way of journal entry(s) with the help of suspense account, for it these errors which gave rise to the suspense account in the trial balance. The rectification entry for other type of error i.e. error affecting more than one account in such a way that a complete journal entry is possible for its rectification, can be rectified in the same way as in the earlier stage (i.e. before trial balance). In a nutshell, it can be said that each and every error detected at this stage can only be corrected by a complete journal entry. Those errors for which journal entries were not possible at the earlier stage will now be rectified by a journal entry(s), the difference or the unknown side is being taken care of by suspense account. Those errors for which entries were possible even at the first stage will now be rectified in the same way. Suppose, the sales book for November, 2022 is casted short by ₹100; as a consequence the trial balance will not agree. The credit column of the trial balance will be ₹100 short and a Suspense Account will be credited by ₹100. To rectify the error the Sales Account will be credited (to increase the credit to the right figure. Now one error remains, the Suspense Account must be closed by debiting the Suspense Account. The entry will be: ₹100₹1,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 118}, page_content='Debit entry of ₹100 to Suspense Account and credit entry of ₹100 to Sales Account to correct the understatement in the sales book for November 2022. 6.5.3 Correction in the next Accounting Period Rectification of errors discussed so far assumes that it was carried out before the books were closed for the concerned year. However, sometimes, the rectification is carried out in the next year, carrying forward the balance in the Suspense Account or even transferring it to the Capital Account. Suppose, the Purchase Book was cast short by ₹1,000 in December, 2022 and a Suspense Account was opened with the difference in the trial balance. If the error is rectified next year and the entry passed is to debit Purchase Account (and credit Suspense Account), it will mean that the Purchases Account for year 2023 will be  more than the amount relating to year 2023 and thus the profit for year 2023 will be less than the actual for that year. Thus, correction of errors in this manner will \\'falsify\\' the Profit and Loss Account. To avoid this, correction of all amounts concerning nominal accounts, i.e., expenses and incomes should be through a special account styled as \"Prior Period Items\" or \"Profit and Loss Adjustment Account\". The balance in the account should be transferred to the Profit and Loss Account. However, these Prior Period Items should be charged after deriving the profit of the current year. \\'Prior Period items\\' are material income or expenses which arise in the current period as a result of errors or omissions in the preparation of the financial statements of one or more prior periods. Prior Period Items should be separately disclosed in the current statement of profit and loss together with their nature and amount in a manner that their impact on current period profit or loss can be perceived. ₹1,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 119}, page_content='BANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENT 1.INTRODUCTION Banks are essential institutions in a modern society. With the increase in volume of trade, commerce and business, business entities faced difficulty in transacting in cash for each business activity. They discovered that dealing through bank, on regular basis, would be the better and safer option and finally large business entities switched over to banking transactions instead of dealing in cash. Now-a-days, most of the transactions of the business are done through bank whether it is a receipt or a payment. Rather, it is legally necessary to operate the transactions through bank after a certain limit. A Bank accepts from people, in general, deposits in various forms, and lends funds to those who need; it also invests some funds in profitable investments. Thus, money which would have been otherwise idle is put to use and is made available to those who need it. Those who deposit the money are able to withdraw it according to the settled terms and conditions. Apart from receiving deposits from and handling cash transactions on behalf of its customers, the bank also renders some other useful services as indicated below:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 120}, page_content=\"1.The bank discounts promissory notes or hundies, i.e., it enables a customer to receive the cash before the due date in consideration of a small charge called discount. 2.The bank allows overdraft to its good customers so that they can make payments even when they do not have sufficient balance in the bank. Of course, the overdraft facility is generally secured and must be cleared later. 3.The bank grants different types of loans (eg. Working capital, term loan) for a specific period say a year or so, to its customers for smooth functioning of their operations in case of lack of self-funding available with customers'. Such financial assistance is of great help for business. 4.The bank on behalf of the customer collects the amount of dividend warrants or interest on securities etc. 5.On instruction of the customer, the bank makes payments of insurance premium, rent etc. on the due dates. 6.The bank sells and purchases shares, debentures or government securities on behalf of its customers. 7.Money can be remitted to another place or persons through the bank at a low cost. 8.The bank in return, for a consideration, furnishes security or guarantee for its customers whose credit is good. 9.The bank also issues letter of credit or travellers' cheque to facilitate commerce or travel. 10.The bank also provides international banking services such as currency exchange, remittance from abroad, cross country payments, foreign letters of credit, export and import credit, etc. 2.BACKGROUND In the past, many corporate frauds have incurred by the companies through manipulating entries either in bank statements or in cash book. For e.g. -A company's financial statement may present incorrect bank balance to mislead the stakeholders. Such kind of instances has made reconciliation of bank and cash balances an integral part of internal control maintained by management. Over the period, reconciling the accounts became an important activity for businesses because it gives an opportunity to check for fraudulent activity happening in the organization and helps to prevent the financial statement errors. Reconciliation is typically done at regular intervals, such as monthly or\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 121}, page_content=\"quarterly, as part of normal accounting procedures, however, frequency is largely dependent on the size of organization and the number of transactions that occur. 3.BANK PASS BOOK Bank pass book is merely a copy of the customer's account in the books of a bank. The bank either sends periodical statements of account or gives a pass book to its customer in which all deposits and withdrawals made by the customer during the particular period is recorded. Both represent almost a copy of the ledger account of the customer in the books of the bank. Thus, it is the bank's way of keeping the customers informed of the entries made in his account. It is the customer's duty to check the entries and immediately inform the bank of any error that he may notice. These days, customers can easily access their bank statement online any time as facilitated by Net Banking. The form of the pass book is given below:                                        PASS BOOK Messers……………………………… in account with Punjab National Bank Daryaganj, New Delhi-110002 Account number - Transaction Period - The bank statement of account also has a similar form except that it is on loose sheets or can be in an online format. The bank itself sends the statements to customers but if the customer wants to maintain a pass book then it is their duty to send the pass book to the bank periodically so that it is updated by the bank. These days, many banks' ATMs have the automated machines where one can get the passbook updated without any manual intervention and without visiting the branch of the bank. Business houses should also obtain at the end of the year a certificate from the bank duly stamped and signed, showing the balance which, the firm carries with the bank as of date. The bank balance shown in the passbook is known as pass book balance for reconciliation purpose. The credit balance as per pass book at a particular point of time is the deposit made by the customer while debit balance as per pass book is the overdraft balance for the customer (i.e. customer owes to bank). Students may note here that the nature of balance shown by passbook (in the books of bank) and cash book (in the books of customer) is quite different. The\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 122}, page_content='debit balance in the pass book represents the credit balance as per the cash book and vice-versa because the business enterprise treats the bank as a debtor/Trade receivable and bank treats the business enterprise as a creditor/Trade payable. 4. BANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENT To reconcile means to identify or find out the difference between two different sources and eliminating that difference. Whenever we deposit or withdraws money from banks, it is always recorded at two places:- Understanding the Components of Financial Reconciliation In financial accounting, reconciliation involves comparing two sets of records to ensure they are in agreement and that figures are accurate and consistent. Two crucial elements involved in the reconciliation process are: 1.Bank Column of the Cash Book: This refers to the section in the cash book maintained by the customer that records all banking transactions, including deposits and withdrawals. It represents the customer\\'s perspective of all banking transactions. 2.Bank Statement (Pass Book): This is the record provided by the bank, detailing the transactions processed through the customer\\'s account. It is the bank\\'s version of the customer\\'s account activity. The reconciliation process involves aligning the bank column of the cash book with the bank statement to identify any discrepancies between the two records. This is an essential practice to ensure that the records reflect the true amount of cash available and to detect any possible errors or inconsistencies. The cash book is maintained by the person having the bank account whereas the bank statement is prepared by the bank. Therefore, the balance in both the books should be equal and opposite in nature. For eg:- if Mr. A deposited ₹ 1,00,000 in his bank account it will be recorded on the Dr. side of his cash book, but for the bank it\\'s a receipt so it will be recorded as a Cr. Entry in the bank statement or the pass book. But most of the times these two balances do not match. The reasons for difference in balances can be many and are explained later in this chapter. It is possible to eliminate this difference by matching all the facts and figures of the two statements. The process of eliminating this difference and bringing the two statements in line with each other is known as \"Reconciliation\", and the statement which reconciles the bank balance as per cash book with the balance as per the pass book by showing all the causes of difference is known as \"BANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENT\".'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 123}, page_content='5.IMPORTANCE OF BANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENT Bank reconciliation statement is a very important tool for internal control of cash flows. It helps in detecting errors, frauds and irregularities occurred, if any, at the time of passing entries in the cash book or in the pass book, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Since frauds can be detected on the preparation of bank reconciliation statement therefore accountants are careful while preparing and maintaining the records of the business enterprise. Hence it works as an important mechanism of internal control. Following are the salient features of bank reconciliation statement: i.The reconciliation will bring out any errors that may have been committed either in the cash book or in the pass book; ii.Any undue delay in the clearance of cheques will be shown up by the reconciliation; iii.A regular reconciliation discourages the accountant of the bank from embezzlement of funds. There have been many cases when the cashiers merely made entries in the cash book but never deposited the cash in the bank; they were able to get away with it only because of lack of reconciliation. iv.It helps in finding out the actual or true position of the bank balance by incorporating the effect of any uncleared funds as well. v.It will ensure accounting of all the financial transactions incurred by the company during a particular financial year. CAUSES OF DIFFERENCE The difference in the both balances (bank balance as per cash book and pass book) may arise because of the following reasons:- 1.TIMING:- Sometimes a transaction is recorded at two different times in cash book and the pass book. This may happen in the following cases:- •Mr. A has issued a cheque to PQR Itd., now it will be recorded in his cash book immediately but the bank will recognize this transaction only when the same cheque will be presented to it by PQR Itd. •Similarly for PQR Ltd, entry in the cash book will be made immediately as the cheque is received from Mr. A but the bank account will be credited when it collects money in respect of that cheque. 2.TRANSACTIONS:- There are various transactions which the bank carries out by itself without intimating the customer. For e.g.:- interest received on a savings bank account, it will be credited by the bank immediately but the entry in the cash book will be made only when the'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 124}, page_content=\"customer comes to know about it, which is usually at a later stage. Similar is the case with Bank charges (which are debited from the customer account by bank). 3.ERRORS:- Mistakes or errors made in preparing the accounts either by the bank or the customer can also result in disagreement of the two statements. For e.g. omission of cheques issued. For this reason rectification of errors is required to be done in both the statements before preparing any Bank Reconciliation Statement. SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT FREQUENTLY CAUSE A DIFFERENCE:- When the bank balance as per Cash Book is greater, reasons include cheques deposited but not cleared, interest and expenses charged by the bank, direct payments by the bank, and dishonour of a bill discounted with the bank. Conversely, when the bank balance as per Pass Book is greater, it can be due to cheques issued but not presented for payment, interest allowed by the bank, interest and dividends collected by the bank, direct payments into the bank by a customer, and bills collected by the bank on behalf of the customer. Above each scenario is explained in detail below along with examples: i.Cheques issued but not presented for payment: The entry in the cash book is made immediately on issue of cheque but naturally entry will be made by the bank only when the cheque is presented for payment. Thus there will be a gap of some days between the entry in the cash book and in the pass book. ii.Cheques deposited with the bank but not cleared: A s  s o o n  a s  cheques are sent to the bank (i.e. deposited with bank), entries are made on the debit side of the bank column of the cash book. But usually banks credit the customer's account only when they have received the payment from the bank concerned- in other words, when the cheques have been cleared. Again, there will be some time gap between the deposit of the cheques and the credit given by the bank. iii.Interest allowed by bank : If the bank has allowed interest to the customer, the entry will normally be made in the customer's account and later shown in the pass book. The customer usually comes to know the amount of the interest by pursuing the pass book and only then he makes relevant entry in the cash book. iv.Interest and expenses charged by the bank: Like (iii) above, the interest charged by the bank and the amount of the bank charges are entered in the customer account and later in the pass book. The customer makes the required entries only after he sees the pass book or bank statement. These are debited to customer account by bank therefore till such entry is passed in\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 125}, page_content=\"cash book, bank balance as per pass book is less than bank balance as per cash book. v.Interest and dividends collected by the bank: Sometimes investments are left with the bank in the safe custody; the bank itself sees to it that the interest or the dividend is collected on the due dates. Entries are made as indicated in (iii) above. vi.Direct payments by the bank: The bank may be given standing instructions for certain payments such as insurance premium, equated monthly installments of loan (EMIs). In these cases also, the customer comes to know of the payment only after viewing the pass book or bank statement. The entries in the pass book and in the cash book may thus be on different dates. vii.Direct payment into the bank by a customer: If such a payment is received by the bank, it will be entered in the customer's account and also in the pass book; the account holder may come to know of the amount only when he sees the pass book. (e.g. Customers' these days prefers using banking facilities like NEFT, RTGS to transfer funds online) viii.Dishonour of a bill discounted with the bank: If the bank is not able to receive payment on promissory notes discounted by it, it will debit the customer's account together with the charges it may have incurred. The customer will naturally make the entry only when he sees the pass book.. ix.Bills collected by the bank on behalf of the customer: If goods are sold, the documents may be sent through the bank. If the bank is able to collect the amount, it will credit the customer's account. The customer may make the entry only on receiving the pass book. All these timing differences will lead to difference in balances as shown by the cash book and the pass book. Following is the table summarising in brief the timings of different transactions: Payment by the account holder through issuing a cheque is recorded in the cash book at the time of issuing the cheque and in the pass book when the cheque is presented for payment or clearing. Receipt by the account holder through a cheque is recorded in the cash book when the cheque is deposited and in the pass book upon collection of the amount from the issuing party. Collection of bills/cheque directly on behalf of the account holder is recorded in the cash book when it is entered in the pass book notice and in the pass book when the amount is collected by the bank.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 126}, page_content=\"Direct payment to the third party on behalf of the account holder is recorded in the cash book when it is entered in the pass book notice and in the pass book when the bank pays the amount. Dishonour of cheque/bills receivable is recorded in the cash book when the entry is posted in the pass book notice and in the pass book when the cheque is dishonoured. Bank charges levied by the bank are recorded in the cash book when the entry is posted in the pass book notice and in the pass book when the bank levies the charges. Interest and dividend credited by the bank are recorded in the cash book when the entry is posted in the pass book notice and in the pass book when the interest or dividend is allowed or collected by the bank. Interest debited by the bank is recorded in the cash book when the entry is posted into the pass book notice and in the pass book when the bank charges the interest. x.Errors: While recording the entries errors can occur both in the cash book and in the pass book. A bank rarely makes an error but if it does, the balance in the pass book will naturally differ from cash book. Similarly if any error is committed in the cash book then it's balance will be different from that of the pass book. Some of the errors include commission of entry, recording of an incorrect amount, recording of entry on the wrong side of the book, wrong totalling of the account or wrong balancing of the book and recording of transactions of other party. 6. PROCEDURE FOR RECONCILING THE CASH BOOK BALANCE WITH THE PASS BOOK BALANCE Before proceeding further, students must understand that 'Dr. balance as per cash book' means deposits in the bank or cash at bank or . balance as per pass book. Similarly, 'Cr. balance as per cash book' means excess amount over deposits withdrawn by the account holder or overdraft balance or Dr. balance as per pass book. It means that students can be required to start bank reconciliation from any of the following four balances as may be given in the question: Dr. balance as per cash book Cr. balance as per cash book Dr. balance as per pass book . balance as per pass book Cr\\nCr\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 127}, page_content='While doing reconciliation, the following types of problems can be given:- The types of problems encountered in the bank reconciliation process. The flowchart is divided into two main categories based on whether the causes of differences between the cash book and bank statement are known or not. Here is a textbook-style description of the content: Types of Problems in Bank Reconciliation Bank reconciliation problems can be broadly categorized based on the availability of information regarding the causes of discrepancies between the bank statement and the cash book. These are: 1.When Causes of Difference are Given Reconciliation without adjusting cash book: This approach is taken when the discrepancies are identified, and the reconciliation is performed without making any adjustments to the cash book. Reconciliation after adjusting cash book: In this scenario, once the differences are identified, appropriate adjustments are made to the cash book before the reconciliation is completed. 2.When Causes of Difference are Not Given Reconciliation without adjusting cash book: This method involves attempting to reconcile the two records without the knowledge of specific discrepancies, and without making alterations to the cash book. Reconciliation after adjusting cash book: This approach entails making educated adjustments to the cash book based on typical reconciling items, even when the exact causes of the discrepancies are not known. Each of these methods has its own applications and is chosen based on the specific circumstances of the reconciliation process. Understanding the nature of the discrepancies is essential for an accurate and effective bank reconciliation. This text explains the different approaches to solving problems in bank reconciliation, tailored to reflect the structure and information presented in the flowchart. When causes of differences are known then students can start reconciliation by taking any of the balance stated above and proceed further with the causes. Given the causes of disagreement, the balance of the other book can be either more or less on account of the said causes. If the balance of the other book is more on account of the said causes, then add the amount. If the balance of the other book is less on account of the said causes, then subtract the amount. For example, if the reconciliation is initiated with Dr. balance as per the cash book and there is a cheque deposited in the bank but not yet cleared, then on account of non-clearance of the cheque, the . balance of the pass book would be less. In this case, the amount of cheque should be subtracted from the cash book Cr'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 128}, page_content=\"balance to arrive at the balance as per the pass book. Similarly, after making all the adjustments the balance as per the other book is obtained. It is necessary to note here that if a student starts from debit balance of cash book and after all adjustments the balance arrived is positive then it is known as . balance as per the pass book and if the balance is negative then it is said to be Dr. balance as per the pass book and vice-versa. But if causes of differences are not known then one has to compare the debit entries of cash book with the credit entries of the pass-book and vice-versa. The entries, which do not tally in the course, are the causes of difference in the balances of both the books. Once the causes are located their effects on both the books are analysed and then reconciliation statement is prepared to arrive at the actual bank balance. In this procedure students, should also take into care that whether opening balance of both the books at particular point of time from where the books are compared, tallies or not. If opening balances are not same then unticked items are divided into two categories i.e., one relating to reconciliation of opening balance and other relating to reconciliation of closing balance. 7.METHODS OF BANK RECONCILIATION There are following two methods of reconciling the bank balances: 7.1 Bank Reconciliation Statement without Preparation of adjusted Cash-Book For reconciliation purposes students can take any of the four balances as the starting point and can proceed further with the causes of differences. Based on the earlier explanation the following table has been prepared for student's ready reference when reconciliation is done on the basis of 'Balance' presentation. The final balance, which will come after addition and subtraction, will be the balance as per the other book (on the opposite side). A cheque deposited but not cleared results in a subtraction from the favorable balance as per the cash-book and an addition to the unfavorable balance. For a cheque issued but not presented to the bank, add to the favorable balance and subtract from the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. When a cheque is directly deposited in the bank by a customer, add to the favorable balance and subtract from the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Income directly received by the bank, like interest, means adding to the favorable balance and subtracting from the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Cr\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 129}, page_content=\"Expenses directly paid by the bank result in subtracting from the favorable balance and adding to the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Bank charges levied by the bank mean subtraction from the favorable balance and addition to the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Locker rent levied by the bank also leads to subtraction from the favorable balance and addition to the unfavorable balance in the cash-book. A wrong debit in the cash book means subtracting from the favorable balance and adding to the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Conversely, a wrong credit in the cash book requires adding to the favorable balance and subtracting from the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Wrong debits or credits in the pass book will have the opposite effect: a wrong debit means adding to the favorable balance and subtracting from the unfavorable balance, while a wrong credit means subtracting from the favorable balance and adding to the unfavorable balance as per the pass-book. Undercasting or overcasting on either side of the bank account in the cash book will require adjustments: add for undercasting and subtract for overcasting to correct the favorable balance and do the opposite for the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. For a bill receivable collected directly by the bank, add to the favorable balance and subtract from the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Interest on bank overdraft charged means subtracting from the favorable balance and adding to the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. The final balance adjustment depends on whether the result is positive or negative, affecting the favorable or unfavorable balance accordingly in both the cash-book and pass-book. It is proper to prepare a neat statement showing the reconciliation of the two balances. Taking the example given in the illustration 1, the statement may be prepared as follows: 1.'Balance' presentation. 2.'Plus & Minus' presentation. 7.2 Bank Reconciliation Statement after the Preparation of adjusted Cash-Book 7.2.1 Meaning of adjusted cash book When the balance in the cash book is first adjusted for certain adjustments before taking it to the bank reconciliation statement, then it is known as adjusted cash book balance. Adjusting the cash-book before preparing the bank reconciliation statement is completely optional, if reconciliation is done during different\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 130}, page_content=\"months. But if reconciliation is done at the end of the accounting year or financial year, the cash-book must be adjusted so as to reflect the correct bank balance in the balance sheet. While adjusting the cash-book the following adjustments are considered:- 1.All the errors (like incorrect amount recorded in the cash-book, entry posted twice in the cash-book, over/undercasting of the balance etc.) and 2.Omissions (like bank charges recorded in the pass-book only, interest debited by the bank, direct receipt or payment by the bank, dishonour of cheques/bills etc.) by the cash-book are taken into care Only above transactions are considered for adjusting cash book. Apart from this, any delay in recording in the pass-book due to difference in timing (like cheque issued but not presented for payment, cheque deposited but not cleared) is taken to bank reconciliation statement. This adjusted cash-book balance is taken to bank reconciliation statement. Errors occurring in the pass-book are not to be adjusted in the cash book. All the adjustments considered in the adjusted cash-book are not carried again to the Bank Reconciliation Statement. INVENTORIES Types of Inventory Inventory types vary significantly depending on the business's operational focus. Inventory in business can be classified as follows: In the Case of Manufacturing Concerns: 1.Raw Materials: These are the basic inputs or components that will be transformed through the manufacturing process. 2.Work-in-Progress (WIP): This includes items that are in the process of being manufactured but are not yet complete. 3.Finished Goods: These are the final products that have completed the manufacturing process and are ready for sale. 4.Stores and Spares: This category consists of the inventory of spare parts and supplies that are kept on hand for maintenance and repairs of manufacturing equipment. In the Case of Trading Concerns: 1.Packing Material: This refers to the material used for packaging the goods for safe transportation or sale. 2.Traded Goods: These are goods purchased by the business with the intention to resell them without further processing.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 131}, page_content=\"Each type of inventory plays a critical role in the business's supply chain and financial reporting. Proper management and valuation of inventory are essential for accurate financial statements and operational efficiency. This description provides a clear and structured explanation of the different types of inventory relevant to manufacturing and trading businesses, as depicted in the image. Formulae for Determining Cost of Inventory Inventory valuation is a critical aspect of accounting that impacts both the cost of goods sold (COGS) and inventory balance. The techniques for valuing inventory fall into two broad categories: Historical Cost Methods and Non-Historical Cost Methods. Historical Cost Methods: This category is based on the actual cost incurred to acquire the inventory and includes: 1.Specific Identification Method: This method tracks the cost of each specific item of inventory. It is used when the items are not ordinarily interchangeable, such as unique or custom products. 2.FIFO (First-In, First-Out): FIFO assumes that the oldest inventory items are sold first, hence the cost of the oldest items is used in the COGS calculation. This is applied to inventory that is ordinarily interchangeable. 3.LIFO (Last-In, First-Out): LIFO assumes that the most recently purchased or produced items are sold first. This method is also used for interchangeable inventory. Non-Historical Cost Methods: These methods do not solely rely on the historical cost of inventory and include: 1.Adjusted Selling Price: This method values inventory based on the selling price, adjusted for the profit margin. 2.Weighted Average Price: Under this method, the cost of inventory is determined by taking a weighted average of all units available for sale during the period, giving consideration to the cost of each unit. The choice of inventory valuation method can significantly affect financial statements and tax calculations. Companies choose a method based on several factors including the nature of the inventory, industry practices, and regulatory requirements.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 132}, page_content='This description explains the different inventory valuation techniques categorized by their reliance on historical costs or other valuation bases, as depicted in the image. Basis of Inventory Valuation Lower of Cost or Net Realizable Value Rule In accounting, the valuation of inventory is guided by a conservative principle which states that inventory should be recorded at the lower of two figures: 1.Cost: This is the price paid to acquire the inventory, including purchase price, freight, handling, and other costs associated with bringing the inventory to its current condition and location. 2.Net Realizable Value (NRV): This is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business minus the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. According to this rule, if the NRV of the inventory is lower than its cost, the inventory is written down to this lower value. This ensures that the inventory is not overstated on the financial statements and reflects any loss in value due to market conditions or obsolescence. The principle is a practical embodiment of the conservatism constraint in accounting, which seeks to present a cautious and risk-averse approach to financial reporting. 1.MEANING Inventory can be defined as assets held •for sale in the ordinary course of business, or •in the process of production for such sale, or •for consumption in the production of goods or services for sale, including maintenance supplies and consumables other than machinery spares, servicing equipment and standby equipment. There can be different types of inventory based on nature of business of an enterprise. The inventories of a trading concern consist primarily of products purchased for resale in their existing form. It may also have an inventory of supplies such as wrapping paper, cartons, and stationery. The inventories of manufacturing concern consist of several types of inventories: raw material (which will become part of the goods to be produced), work-in-process (partially completed products in the factory) and finished products. In manufacturing concerns inventories will also include maintenance supplies, consumables, loose tools and spare parts. However, inventories do not include spare parts, servicing equipment and standby equipment which can be used only in connection with an'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 133}, page_content='item of fixed asset and whose use is expected to be irregular; such machinery spares are generally accounted for as fixed assets. Similarly, in an enterprise engaged in construction business, projects under construction are also considered as inventory. At the year-end (or any period for which books are closed) every business entity needs to ascertain the closing balance of Inventory which comprise of Inventory of raw material, workin-progress, finished goods and other consumable items. Value of closing Inventory is put at the credit side of the Trading Account and asset side of the Balance Sheet. So, before preparation of final accounts, the accountant should know the value of Inventory of the business entity. However, we shall restrict our discussion on inventory valuation of a manufacturing concern and goods of a trading concern. 2.INVENTORY VALUATION A primary issue in accounting for inventories is the determination of the value at which inventories are carried in the financial statements until the related revenues are recognized. Inventory is generally the most significant component of the current assets held by a trading or manufacturing enterprise. It is widely recognized that inventory is one of the major assets that affects efficiency of operations. Both excess of inventory and its shortage affects the production activity, and the profitability of the enterprise whether it is a manufacturing or a trading business. Proper valuation of inventory has a very significant bearing on the authenticity of the financial statements. The significance of inventory valuation arises due to various reasons as explained in the following points: i.Determination of Income The valuation of inventory is necessary for determining the true income earned by a business entity during a particular period. To determine gross profit, cost of goods sold is matched with revenue of the accounting period. Cost of goods sold is calculated as follows: Cost of goods sold  Opening inventory + Purchases + Direct expenses - Closing inventory. Inventory valuation will have a major impact on the income determination if merchandise cost is large fraction of sales price. The effect of any over or under statement of inventory may be explained as: If closing inventory is overstated, then net income will be overstated. If opening inventory is overstated, then net income will be understated. If closing inventory is understated, then net income will be understated. If opening inventory is understated, then net income will be overstated. ='), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 134}, page_content='The effect of misstatement of inventory figure on the net income is always through cost of goods sold. Thus, proper calculation of cost of goods sold and for that matter, proper valuation of inventory is necessary for determination of correct income. ii.Ascertainment of Financial Position Inventories are classified as current assets. The value of inventory on the date of balance sheet is required to determine the financial position of the business. In case the inventory is not properly valued, the balance sheet will not disclose the truthful financial position of the business. Usually, slow-moving or non-moving inventory is the basic reason for poor financial performance as well as financial position of an enterprise. To identify such items, the first step is to value the inventory in the appropriate manner. iii.Liquidity Analysis Inventory is classified as a current asset, it is one of the components of net working capital which reveals the liquidity position of the business. Current ratio which studies the relationship between current assets and current liabilities is significantly affected by the value of inventory. Bankers rely on the current ratio which is denoted as current assets divided by current liabilities. If inventory is a major part of the current assets then, naturally, the next set of questions that arise would be: a)Whether the inventory is properly valued based on consistently applied principles? b)Are there any items of inventory that are either slow-moving or non-moving? c)How often an external auditor has verified the inventories to make the valuation reliable? Studies have shown that poor management of inventories, is one of the reasons of losses of small manufacturing enterprises which eventually leads to shutting down of such business units. iv.Statutory Compliance Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 requires valuation of each class of goods i.e. raw material, work-in-progress and finished goods under broad head to be'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 135}, page_content=\"disclosed in the financial statements. As per the requirements of the Accounting Standards, the financial statements should disclose: a)the accounting policies adopted in measuring inventories, including the cost formula used, and b)the total carrying amount of inventories and its classification appropriate to the enterprise. The common classification of inventories are raw materials; work-in-progress; finished goods; stores-in-trade (in respect of goods acquired for trading) and spares and loose tools. 3.BASIS OF INVENTORY VALUATION Inventories should be generally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This principle is governed by 'Principle of Conservative Accounting' under which any expenses or losses from transactions entered or event occurred are to be recognized immediately, however, any gains or profits are not recognized until it becomes due or are actually realized. Under the principle of 'lower of cost or net realizable value' any loss due to decrease in sales price of the inventory below its cost is recognized immediately as it is anticipated that the enterprise will make losses whenever it will sell. Cost: As per Accounting Standards, Cost of inventories should comprise 1.all cost of purchase, 2.costs of conversion (primarily for finished goods and work - in progress) and 3.other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of purchase consist of purchase price including duties and taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the enterprise from the taxing authorities), freight inwards and other expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition. Trade discounts, rebates, duty drawbacks and other similar items are deducted in determining costs of purchase. In other words, cost includes any amount paid to the seller reduced by any discounts/rebates given by the seller. Similarly, any duties paid to the supplier will be part of cost of the inventory unless the enterprises can recover these taxes duties from the authorities. For example- Raw material required for making a product is bought at ₹100 per unit plus GST at  units of raw material are bought. 18%.100\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 136}, page_content=\"So, the amount that needs to be paid is  units  GST at  However, since the GST on purchase is available as credit, it won't be counted as the cost of purchase. Hence, the cost of purchase will be ₹ 10,000 only and not ₹11,800/- Costs of conversion of inventories include costs directly related to the units of production, such as direct labour. They also include a systematic allocation of fixed and variable overheads. Continuing the above example - for the conversion of 100 units of raw material into finished goods, direct labour cost incurred is . Then, the cost of conversion will be  and thus the value of inventory at this stage is ₹ 13,000 (for 100 units) Other Costs may include administrative overheads incurred to bring the inventory into present location and condition or any cost specifically incurred on inventory of a specified customer. Interest and other borrowing costs are generally not included in the cost of inventory. However, in some circumstances where production process is longer and it is required to carry inventory for a long period e.g. wine, rice and timber it may be appropriate to consider interest and other borrowing cost also part of cost of inventory. In the same example let us assume that ₹200 is paid as unloading charges for the raw material from the truck to the storage place in the factory, in that case ₹200 shall NOT be accounted as unloading charges separately as expenses, but shall be accounted as other costs to bring the inventory to present location. And hence the cost of inventory of 100 units at this stage shall be ₹13,200/- Exclusions from cost of inventories: Following expenses are generally not included in the costs of inventories: a)abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labour or other production overheads: b)storage costs, unless those costs are necessary in the production process prior to further production stage; c)administrative overheads that do not contribute to bringing the inventories to their present location and condition; and d)selling and distribution costs Brief explanation about the exclusions from the cost of inventories: a.Normal wastage of material or labour cost is included in the cost of inventory. However, abnormal wastage is excluded for the reason that it ₹100×100=₹10,000+18%=₹11,800/−₹3,000₹3,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 137}, page_content=\"occurs either due to inefficiency or abnormal factors that won't justify considering those wastages as part of inventory cost. b.Storage costs are normally the cost of doing business. For example, rent of warehouse or storage area is considered as overheads already and hence not considered as cost of inventory. However, if special storage is required as part of the production process, then such storage cost is considered as cost of inventory. For example, in wine making process, requires the raw material is stored in a particular condition for fermentation for a long time (usually years together), such cost of storage is accounted as cost of inventory. c.Administrative overheads do not usually add any specific value to inventories and hence excluded. d.Selling and distribution costs are part of selling and general administration costs and hence excluded. Net realizable value: This is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. In case of finished goods and traded goods net realizable value will generally mean selling price which is reduced by selling and distribution expenses. In case of work in progress, expenses and overheads required to be incurred to convert work -in progress into finished goods and making it ready for sale will also be reduced from selling price. In case of raw materials, replacement cost is generally considered as net realizable value. An assessment is made of as at each balance sheet date. Inventories are usually written down to net realizable value on an item-by-item basis. In some circumstances, however, it may be appropriate to group similar or related items e.g. in case of interchangeable items it may not be possible to identify cost and net realizable value of each item separately. 4.INVENTORY RECORD SYSTEMS There are two principal systems of determining the physical quantities and monetary value of inventories sold and in hand. One system is known as 'Periodic Inventory System' and the other as the 'Perpetual Inventory System'. The periodic system is less expensive to use than the perpetual method. But the useful information obtained from perpetual system is more than cost incurred on it. These systems are distinguished on the basis of the actual records kept to ascertain the cost of goods sold and the closing inventory valuations. 4.1 PERIODIC INVENTORY SYSTEM Periodic inventory system is a method of ascertaining inventory by taking an actual physical count (or measure or weight) of all the inventory items on hand at a particular date on which inventory is valued. It is because of actual\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 138}, page_content='physical count that the system is also called physical inventory system. The cost of goods sold is determined as shown below: Calculation of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is a key figure on the income statement that represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company. The formula to calculate COGS is as follows: COGS = Opening Inventory + Purchases - Closing Inventory Where: Opening Inventory: This is the value of the inventory that a company has at the beginning of the accounting period. It is the inventory carried over from the end of the previous accounting period. Purchases: This represents the total cost of inventory bought by the company during the accounting period. This includes the purchase price, transportation costs, and any other costs directly related to the acquisition of goods. Closing Inventory: This is the value of the inventory that remains unsold at the end of the accounting period. It is determined by a physical count and is carried forward as the opening inventory for the next accounting period. By subtracting the closing inventory from the sum of opening inventory and purchases, a company can determine the cost of the inventory that was actually sold during the period. Periodic inventory system is simple and less expensive than the perpetual system. In this system, inventory account is adjusted at the end of the accounting period to determine cost of goods sold. This system suffers from various limitations: i.Physical inventory taking is required more than once a year for preparation of quarterly or half yearly financial statements thereby making this system more expensive. ii.Physical count of goods requires closure of normal operations of business. iii.As cost of goods sold is taken as residual figure, it is not possible to identify loss of goods due to pilferage, damage or even fraud. iv.Inventory control is not possible under this system. v.Books of accounts does not reflect inventory in hand and its value therefore, it is difficult to plan operations e.g. how much or when to order/manufacture. This system is used by small enterprises where it is easy to control physical inventory. This system is not considered suitable for medium or larger enterprises which generally use Perpetual Inventory system.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 139}, page_content='4.2 PERPETUAL INVENTORY SYSTEM Perpetual inventory system is a system of recording inventory balances after each receipt and issue. In order to ensure accuracy of perpetual inventory records, physical inventory should be checked and compared with recorded balances. Under this system, cost of goods issued is directly determined and inventory of goods is taken as residual figure with the help of inventory ledger in which flow of goods is recorded on continuous basis. The basic feature of this system is the maintenance of inventory ledger to have records of goods on continuous basis. Under perpetual inventory system, closing inventory is determined  as follows: Determination of Closing Stock In accounting, the closing stock (or closing inventory) is the amount of inventory a company has on hand at the end of the accounting period. It can be calculated when the opening inventory, purchases during the period, and the cost of goods sold (COGS) are known by using the following equation: Closing Stock = Opening Inventory + Purchases during the period - Cost of Goods Sold Where: Opening Inventory: This is the value of the stock that the business has at the beginning of the accounting period. It is the unsold inventory carried forward from the previous period. Purchases during the period: This includes all the inventory bought during the current accounting period. It is important that purchases are added to the opening inventory to get the total goods available for sale. Cost of Goods Sold: This is the total cost of all inventory that was sold during the accounting period. It includes the cost of the opening inventory plus the cost of purchases, minus the closing stock. By rearranging the formula to solve for the closing stock, the business can infer the value of unsold inventory at the end of the period. This is crucial for preparing accurate financial statements and for inventory management purposes. This explanation provides an understanding of the method to compute the closing stock as illustrated in the image, an important concept for financial reporting and inventory management. Perpetual inventory system helps to overcome the limitations of periodic system. As inventory is taken as residual figure, it includes loss of goods. However, the main limiting factor is the high cost of using this system. 4.3 DISTINCTION BETWEEN PERIODIC INVENTORY SYSTEM AND PERPETUAL INVENTORY SYSTEM'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 140}, page_content='Both the systems - Periodic Inventory System and Perpetual Inventory System are not mutually exclusive and complementary in nature. Distinction between both the systems can be explained as follows: The Periodic Inventory System relies on physical counts for inventory assessment, whereas the Perpetual Inventory System is based on continuous book records. Periodic Inventory provides inventory and cost of goods sold information at specific times, while Perpetual Inventory offers continuous data on inventory and cost of sales. In the Periodic system, inventory is determined and cost of goods sold is calculated as the remaining amount, whereas the Perpetual system calculates cost of goods sold directly and inventory as the remaining balance. Cost of goods sold in the Periodic system includes items not present as presumed sold, while in the Perpetual system, the closing inventory considers loss of goods since all unsold items are assumed to be in inventory. Inventory control is not feasible under the Periodic system, in contrast to the Perpetual system where inventory control is maintained. The Periodic system is noted for its simplicity and cost-effectiveness compared to the more expensive Perpetual system. The Periodic system necessitates closing the business for inventory counts, whereas the Perpetual system allows for inventory assessment without disrupting business operations. 5.FORMULAE/METHODS TO DETERMINE COST OF INVENTORY 5.1 Historical Cost Methods There is no unique formula for determination of historical cost of inventories. The different techniques for valuation of inventory have been discussed below: i.Specific Identification Method Pricing under this method is based on actual physical flow of goods. It attributes specific costs to identified goods and requires keeping different lots purchased separately to identify the lot out of which units in inventories are left. The historical costs of such specific purpose inventories may be determined on the basis of their specific purchase price or production cost. This method is generally used to ascertain the cost of inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable and their value is high like expensive medical equipment, otherwise it requires the use of FIFO (First in first out) or weighted average price/average price formula.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 141}, page_content='ii.FIFO (First in first out) Method This method is based on the assumption that cost should be charged to revenue in the order in which they are incurred, that is, it is assumed that the issue of goods is usually from the earliest lot on hand. The inventory of goods on hand therefore, consists of the latest consignments. Thus, the closing inventory is valued at the price paid for such consignments. The FIFO formula assumes that the items of inventories which were purchased or produced first are consumed or sold first and consequently items remaining in the inventory at the end of the period are those most recently purchased or produced. This assumption is in line with the good business practice to disposing goods in the order of their acquisition especially in the case of perishable goods and items with frequent technological changes. It must be kept in mind that this assumption of cost flow or goods flow need not be true as a physical fact i.e. not necessary goods are physically also sold or issued in the chronological order of their purchase or production. It relates only to the method of accounting and not to the actual physical movement of goods. Now, let us take an example to understand the application of FIFO method. iii.LIFO (Last in first out) Method As the name suggests, the LIFO formula assigns to cost of goods sold, the cost of goods that have been purchased last though the actual issues may be made out of the earliest lot on hand to prevent unnecessary deterioration in value. The closing inventory then is assumed to consist of earlier consignments and its value is then calculated according to such consignments. Under this basis, goods issued are valued at the price paid for the latest lot of goods on hand which means inventory of goods in hand is valued at price paid for the earlier lot of goods. In the absence of details of issue, the price paid for the earliest consignments is used for valuing closing inventory. LIFO method is based on the principle of matching current cost with current revenue as cost of recently purchased or produced goods are charged to cost against each sale. The cost of goods sold under this method represents the cost of recent purchases resulting that there is better matching of current costs with current sales. iv.Simple Average Price Method Simple Average price for computing value of inventory is a very simple approach. All the different prices are added together and then divided by the number of prices. The closing inventory is then valued according to the price ascertained. This method is generally followed by the entities using periodic inventory method'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 142}, page_content='as it does not require efforts of identifying that closing inventory belongs to which consignments or lots. v.Weighted Average Price Method Simple average price does not consider quantities purchased in various lots. However, it is more logical to compute weighted average price using the quantities purchased in a lot as weights. Under weighted average price method, cost of goods available for sale during the period is aggregated and then divided by number of units available for sale during the period to calculate weighted average price per unit. Thus Weighted  average  price  per  unit   Closing inventory  N o .  of units in inventory  Weighted average price per unit Cost of goods sold  No. of units sold  Weighted average price per unit. 5.2 Non-Historical Cost Methods Non-historical cost methods do not consider the historical cost incurred to acquire the goods. Non- historical cost methods include Adjusted Selling Price method and Standard Cost method. Adjusted Selling Price method can be explained as follows: (i) Adjusted selling price method This method is also called retail inventory method. It is used widely in retail business or in business where the inventory comprises of items, the individual costs of which are not readily ascertainable. The use of this method is appropriate for measuring inventories of large numbers of rapidly changing items that have similar margins and for which it is impracticable to use other costing methods. The cost of the inventory is determined by reducing from the sales value of the inventory an appropriate percentage of gross margin. The percentage used takes into consideration inventory which has been marked below its original selling price. An average percentage for each retail department is often used. The calculation of the estimated gross margin of profit may be made for individual items or groups of items or by departments, as may be appropriate to the circumstances. 6.INVENTORIES TAKING Normally all operations are suspended for one or two days during the financial year and physical inventory is taken for everything in the godown or the store periodically. For the yearend inventory valuation, physical inventory taking is =\\xa0Total\\xa0cost\\xa0of\\xa0goods\\xa0available\\xa0for\\xa0sale\\xa0during\\xa0the\\xa0period\\xa0\\xa0Total\\xa0number\\xa0of\\xa0units\\xa0available\\xa0for\\xa0sale\\xa0during\\xa0the\\xa0period\\xa0=×=×'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 143}, page_content='done during the last week of the financial year or during the first week of next financial year. If inventory taking is finished on 26th March, whereas accounting year ends on 31st March purchases and sales between 26th and 31 st March are then separately adjusted. Later, a value is put on each item. The principle of cost or Net realizable value, whichever is lower, is applied either for the inventory as a whole or item by item. Normally, enterprises prefer to perform inventory taking on the closing day, however, sometimes inventory taking cannot be carried out on the closing day. It is carried out a few days later or sometimes even a few days earlier. In such a case, the actual value of the inventory must be so adjusted as to relate it to the end of the year concerned. For doing so, it will be necessary to take into account the goods that have come in (purchases and sales returns) and those that have gone out (sales and purchase returns) during the interval between the close of the year and the date of actual inventory taking. Further, the adjustment of all goods must be on the basis of cost or NRV whichever is lower. Suppose, a firm that closes its books on 31st December, carried out the inventory taking on the 7th January next year and actual inventory was of the cost of , during the period January 1 to 7 purchases were ₹ 1,53,000 and sales ₹ 2,50,000, the mark up being  on cost. The inventory on 31 st December would be  ₹7,85,00025%₹8,32,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 144}, page_content='DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION 1.INTRODUCTION 1.1 Concept of Depreciation Tangible Assets are assets that have a physical substance i.e., they can be seen and touched, held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes. Useful life of tangible asset is based on expected usage. Property, plant and equipment are tangible items that: a.are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and b.are expected to be used during more than a period of twelve months. These are also called fixed assets in common parlance. When a fixed asset is purchased, it is recorded in books of account at its original or acquisition/purchase cost. However fixed assets are used to earn revenues or save costs for several accounting periods in future with the same acquisition cost until the concerned fixed asset is sold or discarded. For example, acquisition of a machinery expected to be in use for 10 years in the production of finished goods will earn revenues over the next 10 years. Similarly, an ATM machine installed by a bank will result in cost savings over the expected life of such ATM machines for the bank in terms of not requiring to employ personnel to dispense cash for customers. Since the life of such assets exceeds one year, it is therefore necessary that a part of the acquisition cost of such fixed assets be treated or allocated as an expense in each of the accounting period in which the asset is utilized. The amount or value of fixed assets allocated in such manner to respective accounting period is called depreciation. Value of such assets decreases with passage of time mainly due to following reasons. 1.Wear and tear due to its use in business 2.Efflux of time (even when it is not being used) 3.Obsolescence due to technological or other changes'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 145}, page_content='4.Decrease in market value 5.Depletion mainly in case of mines and other natural reserves It is important to account for value of portion of property, plant and equipment utilized for generating revenue during an accounting year to ascertain true income. In other words, against the income/cost savings generated during a period, it is essential to book a portion of the cost of the asset utilized in generating such income/cost savings. This portion of cost of Property, Plant & Equipment allocated to an accounting year is called depreciation. As per Schedule II under the Companies Act, 2013, Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. The depreciable amount of an asset is the cost of an asset or other amount substituted for cost (i.e., in case of revaluation of assets, such revalued amount), less its residual value. The useful life of an asset is the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use by an entity, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the entity. Thus, there are 3 important factors for computing depreciation: • Estimated useful life of the asset •Cost of the asset • Residual value of the asset at the end of the of its estimated useful life Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e., when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Thus it is not necessary that an asset must be used to be depreciated. There is decrease in value of assets due to normal wear and tear or obsolescence even when these are not physically used. Accordingly, value of such wear and tear should be estimated and accounted for. Depreciation is allocated so as to charge a fair proportion of the depreciable amount in each accounting period during the expected useful life of the asset. Depreciation for a period helps to charge that portion of the cost of the asset against the revenues earned, which is expired for that period and hence follows matching principle. In other words the total cost of the asset is reflected in form of a) Expired cost (depreciation) and b) Unexpired Cost which shall be the written down value of the asset being reflected in balance sheet. Also, charging depreciation every year reduces the distributable profits thereby ensuring the availability of funds whenever the replacement is required. The depreciation is a type of loss in the value of assets employed for carrying on a business. Being an essential element of business expenditure, it is necessary to'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 146}, page_content='calculate the amount of such loss and to make a provision, and therefore, arrive at the amount of profit or loss made by the business. Basically, the cost of an asset used for purpose of business has to be written off over its economic (not physical) life which must be estimated. A point to remember is that usually, at the end of the economic life, an asset has some value as scrap or otherwise. The amount to be written off in each year should be as such which will reduce the book value of the asset, at the end of its economic life, to its estimated scrap value. 1.2 Depreciation on components of an assets It may be noted that Accounting Standards as well as the Companies Act, 2013 requires depreciation to be charged on a component basis. Each part of an item of Property, Plant and Equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item should be depreciated separately. An enterprise should allocate the amount initially recognised in respect of an item of property, plant and equipment to its significant parts/components and should depreciate each such part separately based on the useful life and residual value of each particular component. For Example- Aircraft is a classic example of such an asset. The airframe (i.e. the body of the aircraft), the engines and the interiors have different individual useful lives. If the life of the airframe (being the longest of the individual lives of the three major types of components) is taken as the life of the aircraft, it is important that other two major components i.e. engine and interiors are depreciated over their respective useful life and not over the life of airframe. Other components (usually small and low value) which will require replacement very frequently may be depreciated over the useful life of airframe and their frequent replacement cost may be charged to expense as and when it is incurred. Here it is important to note that a part of Property, Plant & Equipment to be identified as a separate component should have both a)significant cost when compared to overall cost of item of property, plant and equipment and b)an estimated useful life or depreciation method different from rest of the parts of the property plant and equipment. A significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment may have a useful life and a depreciation method that are the same as the useful life and the depreciation method of another significant part of that same item. Such parts may be grouped in determining the depreciation charge. 1.3 Objectives for Providing Depreciation Prime objectives for providing depreciation are:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 147}, page_content='1.Correct income measurement: Depreciation should be charged for proper estimation of periodic profit or loss. In case an enterprise does not account for depreciation on Property, Plant & Equipment, it will not be considering loss in value of property, plant  equipment due to their use in production or operations of the enterprise and will not result in true profit or loss for the period. 2.True position statement: Value of the Property, Plant & Equipment should be adjusted for depreciation charged in order to depict the actual financial position. In case depreciation is not accounted for appropriately, the property, plant and equipment would be disclosed in financial statements at a value higher than their true value. We should always present the same at its unexpired cost which is after charging the expired cost as depreciation. 3.Funds for replacement: Generation of adequate funds in the hands of the business for replacement of the asset at the end of its useful life. Depreciation is a good indication of the amount an enterprise should set aside to replace a fixed asset after its economic useful life is over. However, the replacement cost of a fixed asset may additionally be impacted by inflation or other technological changes. 4.Ascertainment of true cost of production: For ascertaining the cost of the production, it is necessary to charge depreciation as an item of cost of production. Further depreciation is a non-cash expense and unlike other normal expenditure (e.g. wages, rent, etc.) does not result in any cash outflow. Further depreciation by itself does not create funds it merely draws attention to the fact that out of gross revenue receipts, a certain amount should be retained for replacement of assets used for carrying on operation which is achieved by charging depreciation that reduces the distributable profits. 2.FACTORS IN THE MEASUREMENT OF DEPRECIATION Estimation of exact amount of depreciation is not easy as it involves lot of estimation. Generally following factors are taken into consideration for calculation of depreciation. 1.Cost of asset including expenses for installation, commissioning, trial run etc. 2.Estimated useful life of the asset (both in terms of time  also utility/units). 3.Estimated scrap value (if any) at the end of useful life of the asset. The above mentioned factors can be explained, in detail, as follows:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 148}, page_content=\"Depreciation of Fixed Assets Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. The process involves several key components: 1.Cost of Asset: This is the historical cost of acquiring the asset, which includes the purchase price and all expenditures necessary to bring the asset to its intended use, such as installation and commissioning costs. Additional costs for improvements that increase the asset's efficiency may also be included. 2.Useful Life of the Asset: The 'Useful Life' of an asset can be defined in two ways: (i) the period over which the asset is expected to be used by the enterprise, or (ii) the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset's use. The determination of useful life involves various factors including experience with similar assets, estimated working hours, production capacity, repairs, and renewals. 3.Scrap (Residual Value): Estimating the residual or scrap value of an asset at the end of its useful life is a challenging task. This value may be considered insignificant, and thus, regarded as nil, or it may be substantial, estimated at the time of asset acquisition or during a revaluation. 4.Depreciable Amount: This is the historical cost of the asset or its revalued amount, less any estimated residual value. For instance, if a machine with a historical cost of ₹1,10,000 is estimated to have a residual value of ₹10,000 and a useful life of 5 years, the depreciable amount would be ₹1,00,000. The annual depreciation in this case would be calculated as ₹1,00,000 divided by the useful life of 5 years. The depreciable amount is allocated on a systematic basis over the asset's useful life, reflecting the pattern in which the asset's economic benefits are consumed by the enterprise. This explanation captures the key elements and calculations involved in the depreciation of assets as indicated in the image.  Cost of Property, Plant and Equipment comprises: a)its purchase price, including non-refundable import duties and purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates. b)any cost directly attributable to bring the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in a manner intended by the enterprise. \\xa0Depreciation\\xa0=\\xa0Depreciable\\xa0amount\\xa0\\xa0Estimated\\xa0useful\\xa0life\\xa0\\xa0i.e.\\xa0₹1,00,000/5=₹20,000\\xa0per\\xa0year\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 149}, page_content='c)the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling, removing, the item and restoring the site on which an asset is located. Examples of directly attributable costs are: a.cost of employee benefits arising directly from acquisition or construction of an item of property, plant and equipment. b.cost of site preparation c.initial delivery and handling costs d.installation and assembly costs e.cost of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, after deducting the net proceeds from selling the items produced while testing (such as samples produced while testing) f.professional fees e.g. engineers hired for helping in installation of a machine Thus, all the expenses which are necessary for the asset to bring it in condition and location of desired use will become part of cost of the asset. However, following expenses should not become part of cost of asset: a)costs of opening new facility or business, such as inauguration costs; b)cost of introducing new product or service (for example cost of advertisement or promotional activities). c)cost of conducting business in a new location or with a new class of customer (including cost of staff training); and d)administration and other general overhead costs. Once an asset has been brought to its intended condition and location of use, no cost should be recognized as part of cost of the asset unless there is major repair or addition which increases the useful life of the asset or improves the production capacity of the asset. Accordingly, cost incurred while an item is capable of operating in intended manner but it is not yet put to use or is used at less than full capacity should not be capitalized as part of cost of the asset. Similarly, cost of relocation of an asset should not be capitalized. Any additions made to a particular item of property, plant and equipment after it is initially put to use are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. Any addition or extension which has a separate identity and is capable of being used after the existing asset is disposed of, is accounted for separately. Therefore, it is important to maintain an asset register capturing asset wise details of cost,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 150}, page_content=\"rate of depreciation, date of capitalization etc. All these details need to be captured for any additions to existing assets as well. In the absence of the adequate information, it will be very difficult to compute depreciation expense year on year. Also, at the time of disposal or discard of a particular asset, it will not be possible to compute gain or loss on such disposal/discard. 3.METHODS FOR PROVIDING DEPRECIATION Generally, methods for providing depreciation are based on formula, developed on a study of the behavior of the assets over a period of years for readily computing the amount of depreciation suffered by different forms of assets. Each of the methods, however, should be applied only after carefully considering nature of the asset and the conditions under which it is being used. Commonly Used Methods of Depreciation Depreciation methods are systematic approaches to allocate the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. Two prevalent methods are: 1.Straight-Line Method: This method results in a constant depreciation charge over the useful life of the asset, assuming that the asset's residual value does not change. The straight-line method is simple and is calculated by dividing the depreciable amount of the asset by the number of years of its useful life. 2.Diminishing Balance Method: Also known as the reducing balance method, this results in a decreasing charge over the useful life of the asset. The depreciation expense is higher in the earlier years of an asset's life and decreases over time. This method is based on the premise that an asset is more productive in its early years than in its later years. The choice between these methods depends on the nature of the asset, the pattern of its economic benefits, and company policy. The Income Tax Rules, however, prescribe the Diminishing Balance Method except in the case of assets of an undertaking engaged in generation and distribution of power. 3.1 Straight Line Method According to this method, an equal amount is written off every year during the working life of an asset so as to reduce the cost of the asset to nil or its residual value at the end of its useful life. The advantage of this method is that it is simple to apply and gives accurate results especially in case of leases, and also in case of plant and machinery. This method is also known as Fixed Instalment Method. Straight Line Depreciation  =\\xa0Cost\\xa0of\\xa0Asset\\xa0−\\xa0Scrap\\xa0Value\\xa0\\xa0Usefullife\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 151}, page_content='Straight Line Depreciation Rate  The underlying assumption of this method is that the particular tangible asset generates equal utility during its lifetime. But this cannot be true under all circumstances. The expenditure incurred on repairs and maintenance will be low in earlier years, whereas the same will be high as the asset becomes old. Apart from this the asset may also have varying capacities over the years, indicating logic for unequal depreciation provision. However, many assets have insignificant repairs and maintenance expenditures for which straight line method can be applied. While using this method the period of use of an asset in a particular year should also be considered. In the year of purchase of an asset it may have been available for use for part of the year only, accordingly depreciation should be proportioned to reflect the period for which it was available for use. For example, if an asset was purchased on March 1, 2022 and the enterprise prepares financial statements for the year ending on March 31, 2022 depreciation will be provided for a period of 1 month only. Similar situation will arise in the year in which an asset is retired from its intended used or is sold. 3.2 Reducing or Diminishing Balance Method or Written Down Value (WDV) Method Under this system, a fixed percentage of the diminishing value of the asset is written off each year so as to reduce the asset to its residual value at the end of its life. Repairs and small renewals are charged to revenue. This method is commonly used for plant, fixtures, etc. Under this method, the annual charge for depreciation decreases from year to year, so that the earlier years suffer to the benefit of the later years. Also, under this method, the value of asset can never be completely extinguished, which happens in the earlier explained Straight Line Method. This method is based on the assumption that cost of repairs will increase as the asset gets old, therefore, depreciation in earlier years should be high when the repair cost is expected to be low and depreciation in later years should be low when the repair cost is expected to be high. Therefore, this method will result in almost equal burden in all the years of use of the asset as depreciation will reduce with increase in repair costs will increase with every passing year. On the other hand, under the Straight Line Method, the charge for depreciation is constant, while repairs tend to increase with the life of the asset. Among the disadvantages of this method is the danger that too low a percentage may be adopted as depreciation with the result that over the life of the asset full depreciation may not be provided; also if assets are grouped in such a way that individual assets are difficult to identify, the residue of an asset may lie in the asset account even after the asset has been scrapped. The last mentioned difficulty could be, however, over come if a Plant register is maintained. =\\xa0Straight\\xa0Line\\xa0Depreciation\\xa0\\xa0Cost\\xa0of\\xa0Asset\\xa0×100'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 152}, page_content='The rate of depreciation under this method may be determined by the following formula:  where,  useful life Similar to straight line method, in this method also period of use in a particular year e.g. year of purchase or sale an item of property plant and equipment needs to be considered while computing the depreciation amount. Accounting Entries under Straight Line and Reducing Balance Methods: There are two alternative approaches for recording accounting entries for depreciation. First Alternative A provision for depreciation or Accumulated Depreciation account is opened to accumulate the balance of depreciation and the assets are carried at historical cost. This method is preferred by most of the organizations as it presents both the gross investment and the current value of the assets. Accounting entry Depreciation Account Dr. To Provision for Depreciation Account  or Accumulated Depreciation Profit and Loss Account                  Dr. To Depreciation Account Second Alternative Amount of Depreciation is credited to the Asset Account every year and the Asset Account is carried at historical cost less depreciation.

In this case, the annual depreciation is calculated by multiplying the original cost of the asset less its estimated scrap value by the fraction represented by: The number of years (including the present year) of remaining life of the asset Total of all digits of the life of the asset (in years) Suppose the estimated life of an asset is 10 years; the total of all the digits from 1 to 10 is 55 i.e., , or by the formula:   The depreciation to be written off in the first year will be 10/55 of the cost of the asset less estimated scrap value; and the depreciation for the second year will be  of the cost of asset less estimated scrap value and so on. The method is not yet in vogue; and its advantages are the same as those of the Reducing Balance Method. 3.4 Machine Hour Method Where it is practicable to keep a record of the actual running hours of each machine, depreciation may be calculated on the basis of hours that the concerned machine worked. The machine hour rate of the depreciation, is calculated after estimating the total number of hours that machine would work during its whole life; however, it may have to be varied from time to time, on a consideration of the changes in the economic and technological conditions which might take place, to ensure that the amount provided for depreciation corresponds to that considered appropriate in the changed circumstances. It would be observed that the method is a variation of the Straight Line Method under which depreciation is calculated per year. Under this method it is calculated for each hour the machine works. 10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1n(n+1)=10×11=55229/55'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 154}, page_content='Schedule II to the Companies Act 2013 which prescribes estimated useful life of different assets for companies also recognizes this method to some extent. It prescribes that depreciation should be charged using estimated useful life suggested in it; however, in certain category of plant and machinery it prescribes charging higher amount of depreciation if these assets are used for 2 shifts or 3 shifts. In a way, schedule II combines straight line method and machine hour method. 3.5 Production Units Method Under this method depreciation of the asset is determined by comparing the annual production with the estimated total production. The amount of depreciation is computed by the use of following method:  The method is applicable to machines producing product of uniform specifications. 3.6 Depletion Method Depletion is the allocation of the cost of wasting natural resources such as oil, gas, timber, and minerals to the production process. This method is used in case of mines, quarries etc. containing only a certain quantity of product. The depreciation rate is calculated by dividing the cost of the asset by the estimated quantity of product likely to be available to be extracted. Annual depreciation will be the quantity extracted multiplied by the rate per unit. 4.PROFIT OR LOSS ON THE SALE/DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Whenever any depreciable asset is sold during the year, depreciation is charged on it for the period it has been used in the sale year. The written down value after charging such depreciation is used for calculating the profit or loss on the sale of that asset. The resulting profit or loss on sale of the asset is ultimately transferred to profit and loss account. Thus, all entries related to sale and profit or loss on sale of asset are posted in the respective asset account. Alternatively, a new account titled Asset disposal Account may also be opened in the ledger for the purpose of calculating profit or loss on sale of asset. In that case the book value of the asset will be transferred from the asset account to the asset disposal account and all entries related to sale like sale proceeds and calculation of profit or loss on sale will be posted in the Asset disposal account. 5.CHANGE IN THE METHOD OF DEPRECIATION \\xa0Depreciable\\xa0Amount\\xa0×\\xa0Production\\xa0during\\xa0the\\xa0period\\xa0\\xa0Estimated\\xa0total\\xa0production'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 155}, page_content=\"The depreciation method applied to an asset should be reviewed at least at each financial year-end and, if there has been a significant change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset, the method should be changed to reflect the changed pattern. Whenever any change in depreciation method is made, such change in method is treated as change in accounting estimate as per Accounting Standards. Its effect needs to be quantified and disclosed separately. A change in an accounting estimate may affect the current period only or both the current period and future periods. 6.REVISION OF THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT The residual value and the useful life of an asset should be reviewed at least at each financial year-end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the change(s) should be accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with Accounting Standards. Whenever there is a revision in the estimated useful life of the asset, the written down value or the balance depreciable amount should be charged over the revised remaining estimated useful life of the asset. 7.REVALUATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT After recognizing an asset initially, the asset whose fair value could be reliably measured could be carried at the revalued amount, being the fair value at revaluation date and reduced by successively accumulated depreciation and successive accumulated impairment losses (permanent decline in value) (if any). If an entity opts for revaluation: a)Revaluations must be made at adequate intervals (say yearly) for ensuring that carrying amount doesn't differ substantially from that which would be determined if fair value at end of the reporting period is used b)In case an item of PPE is revalued, whole class of such PPE to which such asset belongs should be revalued c)In case the carrying amount of an asset increases due to revaluation, such increase should be credited to revaluation surplus and should be accumulated in equity. However, such increase should be recognized in Profit and Loss statement to the extent of reversal of a previous decrease of that asset that was recognized in the Profit and Loss statement. d)In case the carrying amount of an asset is decreased due to revaluation, such decrease should be recognized in the Profit and Loss account. However, such decrease should be debited to the revaluation surplus to the extent of\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 156}, page_content=\"reversal of a previous increase that was recognized in revaluation surplus for that asset. e)The Revaluation Surplus may be transferred directly to retained earnings when the asset is derecognized. This may involve transferring the whole of the surplus when the asset is retired or disposed of. Such transfer from Revaluation Surplus to Retained Earnings cannot be made through the Profit or Loss. Alternatively, where there is an upward revaluation, the excess depreciation on account of such upward revaluation may be transferred from Revaluation Surplus to Retained Earnings. Such transfer from Revaluation Surplus to Retained Earnings cannot be made through the Profit or Loss. It may be pertinent to note that revaluation of Property, Plant and Equipment is an accounting policy choice, and not mandatory under the accounting standards or the Companies Act, 2013. Accounting for Revaluation of Assets Revaluation of assets is an adjustment of the carrying value of a fixed asset to its current market value. The accounting entries for revaluation can result in either an increase or a decrease in the asset's book value, and the treatment of these changes is as follows: For an Increase in Asset Value: The increase is credited directly to the owners' equity under the heading of revaluation surplus, reflecting the appreciation in the asset's value. Exception: If the increase is a subsequent increase following an initial decrease, the increase should be recognized in the profit and loss statement to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in the profit and loss. For a Decrease in Asset Value: The decrease is charged directly to the profit and loss statement, reflecting a loss in the asset's value. Exception: If the decrease occurs after an initial increase in value, the decrease should be debited directly to owners' equity under the heading of revaluation surplus to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset. These accounting treatments ensure that the financial statements reflect the true value of the assets and the financial position of the business accurately. 8.INTANGIBLE ASSETS\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 157}, page_content='An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset, without physical substance, held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes. Examples of intangible assets include: a.Streaming rights of movies / TV shows / web series on platforms like Netflix, Disney Hot Star, Amazon Prime / Sony LIV etc. b.Broadcasting rights of events such as the Cricket World Cup, the Indian Premier League, the Pro Kabaddi League etc. c.Landing rights / time slots at airports which permit aircrafts to land or take-off during a particular time frame d.Patents e.Trademarks f.Copyrights g.Distribution rights for motion pictures in theatres h.Long-term customer contracts i.Customer data collected by the entities such as customer contact numbers / email IDs and spending data at stores like Pantaloons, Westside etc. could be a major intangible asset for these entities. j.Goodwill (purchased) k.Computer Software Intangible assets comprise a major portion of the balance sheet. It may be noted that it can also be the case that intangible assets could make the entities far more valuable than the tangible assets. For instance, a multi-year customer contract guaranteeing more than  of the revenue for the company is a major asset, which on occasions could be more valuable than the tangible assets themselves. Similarly, when Air India was up for acquisition, the tangible assets comprised of several old planes which needed overhauling and maintenance. However, one of the major reasons that made Air India a desirable target was the prime landing slots (intangible asset) that it had at airports across the world Intangible assets can be recognized in the financial statements provided they meet the following conditions: i.The intangible asset is identifiable. Being identifiable means the entity could rent, sell, exchange or distribute the specific future economic benefits attributable to the asset 75%'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 158}, page_content='without disposing of future economic benefits that flow from other assets used in the same revenue earning activity. ii.The enterprise can exercise control over such intangible asset. Control means the power available with the enterprise to obtain economic benefits from the asset and at the same time, can restrict access of others to those benefits. iii.It is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the enterprise; and iv.The cost of the intangible asset can be measured reliably. An intangible asset acquired separately usually measured at cost, as cost can be measured reliably in such cases. The cost of the intangible asset would comprise of: •Purchase price •Any import duties and taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the enterprise from the tax authorities) •Any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use e.g., professional fees towards legal services. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the cost. As can be seen above, the cost of an intangible asset is similar to the manner in which the cost of a tangible asset is determined. Intangible assets acquired as part of acquisition, government grants, internally generated goodwill / intangible assets, or on exchange of assets are dealt separately at the intermediate level. An intangible asset should be derecognised (eliminated from the balance sheet) on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use and subsequent disposal. Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of an intangible asset should be determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and should be recognised as income or expense in the statement of profit and loss. Difference between Tangible and Intangible Assets Tangible Assets: These are assets that have a physical substance, i.e., they can be seen and touched, held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 159}, page_content=\"to others, or for administrative purposes. Tangible Assets have a finite life based on expected usage. Useful life is based on expected usage, with no presumption laid down for the same. Tangible Assets are depreciated over the useful life. In other words, writing off the value of tangible assets on an annual basis is known as depreciation. Examples include Property, Machinery, Vehicles etc. Intangible Assets: These are identifiable assets that do NOT have a physical substance, held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes. Intangible Assets have a finite life based on contractual terms. In some cases, intangible assets could also have an indefinite life e.g., purchased goodwill. Useful life of Intangible Assets is presumed not to exceed 10 years unless evidence exists to the contrary. Intangible Assets are amortised over the useful life. In other words, writing off the value of intangible assets on an annual basis is known as amortisation. Examples include software, streaming rights, landing rights, trademarks, patents etc. 9.AMORTISATION The concept of amortisation in case of intangible assets is similar to the concept of depreciation in case of tangible assets. In other words, 'depreciation of an intangible asset' is called AMORTISATION. Amortisation can be defined as 'the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an intangible asset over its useful life'. Depreciable amount is the cost of an asset less its residual value. Useful life is either: a)the period of time over which an asset is expected to be used by the enterprise; or b)the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the enterprise. Residual value is the amount which an enterprise expects to obtain for an asset at the end of its useful life after deducting the expected costs of disposal. The depreciable amount of an intangible asset should be allocated on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life. Amortisation should commence when the asset is available for use. It is presumed that the useful life of an intangible asset will not exceed ten years from the date when the asset is available for use unless evidence exists to the contrary. For instance, given the rapid changes in technology, computer software and many other intangible assets are susceptible to technological obsolescence. Therefore, it is likely that their\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 160}, page_content=\"useful life will be short. Similarly, intangible assets with contractual rights for a period exceeding ten years, will be amortised over such extended period rather than the presumed period of ten years. Similar to depreciation, the amortisation method used should reflect the pattern in which the asset's economic benefits are consumed by the enterprise. If that pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method should be used. The amortisation charge for each period should be recognised as an expense unless permitted or required to be included in the carrying amount of another asset. Given the nature of intangible assets, the residual value of an intangible asset should be assumed to be zero unless: a.there is a commitment by a third party to purchase the asset at the end of its useful life; or b.there is an active market for the asset and: i.residual value can be determined by reference to that market; and ii.it is probable that such a market will exist at the end of the asset's useful life. The amortisation period and the amortisation method should be reviewed at least at each financial year end. If the expected useful life of the asset is significantly different from previous estimates, the amortisation period should be changed accordingly. If there has been a significant change in the expected pattern of economic benefits from the asset, the amortisation method should be changed to reflect the changed pattern. BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND PROMISSORY NOTES Bills of Exchange A Bill of Exchange is a written, unconditional order by one party (the drawer) to another (the drawee) to pay a certain sum, either immediately (a sight bill) or on a fixed date (a term bill), to the drawer or to a third party specified by the drawer. There are two types based on the nature of the transaction: 1.Normal Trading: This is used in typical business transactions and involves elements such as: Date of Expiry: The date when the bill is no longer valid. Due Date: The specific date when the amount stated on the bill is payable.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 161}, page_content=\"Days of Grace: Additional days allowed beyond the due date before the bill is considered overdue. Maturity Date: The actual date of payment, taking into account the days of grace. 2.Accommodation: These are bills drawn for mutual benefit or for the benefit of one party, typically without the exchange of goods or services. The nature of a Bill of Exchange can be further detailed as: Bill at Sight: Requires the drawee to pay on demand. Bill after Date: Specifies that payment is due a certain period after the bill has been presented. Bill on Demand: Requires payment whenever it is demanded by the holder. Other Aspects related to Bills of Exchange include: Dishonour of Bill: Occurs when the drawee refuses to accept or pay the bill. Noting Charges: Fees associated with the formal recording of the dishonour. Renewal of Bill: Issuing a new bill after the old one has been dishonoured or its payment has been postponed. Insolvency: The drawee's inability to pay the bill due to financial failure. Retirement of Bill: Early payment of the bill before its maturity. Bills for Collection: Bills that are sent to a bank or an agent for collection of the payment. Promissory Note A Promissory Note is a financial instrument that contains a written promise by one party to pay another party a definite sum of money either on demand or at a specified future date. It is a simpler instrument than a bill of exchange and is not as commonly used in international trade. 1.BILLS OF EXCHANGE It is general practice that when goods are sold or services are provided, the seller extends a credit period to buyer. Sometimes, the seller may not be in a position to offer credit period and the purchase is not in a position to pay immediately. In such circumstances the seller would like that the purchaser should give a definite promise in writing to pay the amount of the goods on a certain date which he can use to generate immediate funds. Commercial practice has developed to treat these written promises into valuable instruments of credit that when a written promise is made in proper form and is properly stamped, it is expected that the buyer discharges his debt and the seller receives payment. This is because written promises are often accepted by banks and money is advanced against them. Also,\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 162}, page_content='they can be endorsed, i.e., passed on from person to person. The written promise is either in the form of a Bill of Exchange or in the form of a promissory note. A Bill of Exchange has been defined as an \"instrument in writing containing an unconditional order signed by the maker directing certain person to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of a certain person or to the bearer of the instrument\". When such an order is accepted in writing on the face of the order itself, it becomes a valid bill of exchange. Suppose A orders B to pay ₹50,000 for three months after date and B accepts this order by signing his name, then it will be a bill of exchange. A Bill of Exchange has the following characteristics: 1.It must be in writing. 2.It must be dated. 3.It must contain an order to pay a certain sum of money. 4.The promise to pay must be unconditional. 5.The money must be payable to a definite person or to his order to the bearer. 6.The draft must be accepted for payment by the party to whom the order is made. 7.It should be properly stamped (except in case of bills payable \"on demand\") 8.Payment must be in legal currency of the country. The party which makes the order is known as the drawer. The party which accepts the order is known as the acceptor and the party to whom the amount has to be paid is known as the payee. The drawer and the payee can be the same. A Bill of Exchange can be passed on to another person by endorsement. Endorsement on a bill of exchange is made exactly as it is done in the case of a cheque. The primary liability on a bill of exchange is that of the acceptor. If he does not pay, a holder can recover the amount from any of the previous endorsers or the drawee. Sometimes, it may happen that a bill of exchange is drawn for foreign trade operations. Such a bill is known as \"Foreign Bill of Exchange\". A foreign bill of exchange is one which is drawn in one country and is payable in another. It is generally drawn up in triplicate wherein each copy is sent by separate post so that at least one copy reaches the intended party. Payment will be made only on one of'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 163}, page_content='the copies and when such payment is made the other copies become useless.

A notice of dishonor is not required in the case of promissory note dishonour. Note: In both instruments, dishonour leads to certain legal implications for the parties involved. In the case of a Bill of Exchange, a notice of dishonour may be necessary, whereas for a Promissory Note, such notice is typically not required. 4.RECORD OF BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND PROMISSORY NOTES A party which receives a Promissory Note or receives an accepted Bill of Exchange will treat it as a new asset under the name of Bills receivable. A party which issues a Promissory Note or accepts a Bill of Exchange will treat it as new liability under the heading of Bills Payable. We shall first deal with the entries in the books of the party which receives promissory notes or bills. (When we talk of bills, we include promissory notes also). On receipt of Bill, the payee makes the following entry in his books of accounts: Bills Receivable Account                                                 Dr. To Drawee/Maker of the note (1) A accepts a Bill of exchange drawn on him by B. In the books of B the entry will be : Bills Receivable Account                                                Dr. To A (2) A sends to B the acceptance of D. In this case also, the entry in the books of B will be:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 166}, page_content='Bills Receivable Account                                                 Dr. To A The person who receives the bill has three options. These are: i.He can hold the bill till maturity. (Naturally in this case no further entry is passed until the date of maturity arrives). ii.The bill can be endorsed in favour of another party say Z. In this case, the entry will be to debit the party which now receives the bill and to credit the Bills Receivable Account. Z Dr. To Bills Receivable Account iii.The Bill of Exchange can be discounted with bank. The bank will deduct a small sum of money as discount and pay rest of the money. Bank Account Dr. (with the amount actually received) Discount Account Dr. (with the amount of loss or discount) To Bills Receivable Account On the date of maturity there will be two possibilities: a)The first is that the bill will be paid, that is to say, met or honoured. The entries for this will depend upon what was done to the bill during the period of maturity. If the bill was kept, the cash will be received by the party which originally received the bill. In his books, therefore, the entry will be : Bank Account                                  Dr. To Bills Receivable Account But if he has already endorsed the bill in favour of his creditor or if the bill has been discounted with the bank he will not get the amount; it will be the creditor or the bank which will receive the money. Therefore, in these two cases, no entry will be made in the books of the party which originally received the bill. b)The second possibility is that the bill will be dishonoured, that is to say, the bill will not be paid. If the bill is dishonoured, the bill becomes useless and the party from whom the bill was received will be liable to pay the amount (and also the expenses incurred by the party). Therefore, the following entries will be made :'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 167}, page_content=\"1.If the bill was kept till maturity then : Drawee / Maker Account Dr. To Bills Receivable Account 2.If the bill was endorsed in favour of a creditor, the entry is : Drawee / Maker Account Dr. To Creditor Account 3.If the bill was discounted with the bank : Drawee / Maker Account Dr. To Bank Account Thus, it will be seen that in case of dishonour, the party which gave the bill has to be debited (because he has become liable to pay the amount). The credit entry is in Bills Receivable Account (if it was retained) or the Creditor or the bank (if it was endorsed/discounted in their favour). 5. TERM OF A BILL The term of bill of exchange may be of any duration. Usually the term does not exceed 90 days from the date of the bill. When a bill is drawn after sight, the term of the bill begins to run from the date of 'sighting', i.e., when the bill is accepted. When a bill is drawn after date, the term of the bill begins to run from the date of drawing the bill. 6.EXPIRY / DUE DATE OF A BILL The date on which the term of the bill terminates is called as 'Expiry/Due Date of the bill'. 7.DAYS OF GRACE Every instrument payable otherwise than on demand is entitled to three days of grace. 8.DATE OF MATURITY OF BILL\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 168}, page_content='The date which comes after adding three days of grace to the expiry/due date of a bill, is called the date of maturity. The maturity of a promissory note or bill of exchange is the date at which it falls due. Every promissory note or bill of exchange gets matured on the third day after the day on which it is expressed to be payable, except when it is expressed to be payable: i.on demand, ii.at sight, or iii.on presentment 9.BILL AT SIGHT Bill at Sight means the instruments in which no time for payment is mentioned. A cheque is always payable on demand. A promissory note or bill of exchange is payable on demand- a.when no time for payment is specified, or b.when it is expressed to be payable on demand, or at sight or on presentment. Notes: i.\"At sight\" and \"presentment\" means on demand. ii.An instrument payable on demand may be presented for payment at any time. iii.Days of grace is not to be added to calculate maturity for such types of bill. 10.BILL AFTER DATE Bill after date means the instrument in which time for payment is mentioned. A promissory note or bill of exchange is a time instrument when it is expressed to be payable- a)after a specified period. b)on a specific day c)after sight d)on the happening of event which is certain to happen'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 169}, page_content=\"Notes: i.The expression 'after sight' means- a.in a promissory note, after presentment for sight b.in a bill of exchange, after acceptance or noting for non-acceptance or protest for non-acceptance. ii.A cheque cannot be a time instrument because the cheque is always payable on demand. Though a cheque can be post dated and which can be presented on or after such date. A cheque has validity of 90 days from its date after that it becomes void, normally termed as 'Stale Cheque' as bank will not honour such cheque. 11.HOW TO CALCULATE DUE DATE OF A BILL The due date of each bill is calculated as follows: Determining the Due Date of a Bill of Exchange The due date of a bill of exchange, which is when the payment must be made, varies depending on several circumstances: a.If the bill specifies a particular date: The due date is that exact date as stated on the bill. b.If the bill specifies a payment period in months after the bill's date: The due date falls on the corresponding day of the month in which the payment period ends. If there is no equivalent date in the final month, the due date is the last day of that month. For example, a bill dated January 31st payable in 3 months would have a due date of April 30th. Note: The date of the bill itself is not included in the calculation. c.If the bill specifies a payment period in days after the bill's date: The due date is calculated by adding the specified number of days to the date on the bill. Note: The issue date of the bill is not counted. d.If the due date falls on a public holiday: The due date is moved to the preceding business day. e.If the due date falls on an emergency or unforeseen holiday: The due date is deferred to the next following business day.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 170}, page_content='These provisions ensure that the payment of a bill of exchange is clearly defined and that both parties are aware of their obligations and rights concerning the payment date. Note: The term of a Bill after sight commences from the date of acceptance of the bill whereas the term of a Bill after date commences from the date of drawing of bill. 12.NOTING CHARGES It is necessary that the fact of dishonour and the causes of dishonour should be established. If the acceptor can prove that the bill was not properly presented to him for payment, he may escape liability. Therefore, if there is dishonour, or fear of dishonour, the bill will be given to a public official known as \"Notary Public\". These officials present the bill for payment and if the money is received, they will hand over the money to the original party. But if the bill is dishonoured they will note the fact of dishonour, with the reasons and give the bill back to their client. For this service they charge a small fee. This fee is known as noting charges. The amount of noting charges is recoverable from the party which is responsible for dishonour. Suppose  received from  a bill for . On Maturity the bill is dishonoured and  is paid as noting charges. The entry in this case will be Y Dr. 1,010 To Bills Receivable Account A/c 1,000 Journal Entry: Debit: Cash Account (Y) ₹1,010 Credit: Bills Receivable Account ₹1,000 Explanation: This journal entry records the receipt of cash amounting to ₹1,010 into the Cash Account labeled \\'Y\\'. Correspondingly, it credits the Bills Receivable Account, indicating that a bill of ₹1,000 has been honored and settled. The difference of ₹10 may represent an interest income or other charges related to the receipt of the bill. Suppose  had endorsed this bill in favour of . In that case entry for dishonoured bill would have been Y Dr. 1,010  XY₹1,000₹10\\nXZ\\xa0To\\xa0Z\\xa01,010'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 171}, page_content='This is because  will claim  f r o m   a n d   has the right of recovering  from . Similarly, if the bill has been discounted with a bank, entry will be : Y Dr. 1,010 To Bank A/c 1,010 13.RENEWAL OF BILL Sometimes the acceptor is unable to pay the amount and he himself moves that he should be given extension of time and in consideration agrees to bear interest for the extended time period (calculated from the date of maturity of old bill till the date of expected settlement). In such a case a new bill will be drawn and the old bill will be cancelled. If this happens entries should be passed for cancellation of the old bill. This is done exactly as already explained for dishonour. When the new bill is received entries for the receipt of the bill will be repeated. The amount of the new bill may represent any of the following: i.Where the drawee pays nothing: Total of amount of original bill as well as the interest for the extended time period. ii.Where the drawee pays the interest amount at the time of renewal: Amount of the Original bill. iii.Where the drawee makes part payment of the original bill or interest amount or both: Unpaid part of total of amount of original bill as well as the interest for the extended time period on such amount. 14.RETIREMENT OF BILLS OF EXCHANGE & REBATE We have seen that renewal of a bill of exchange is made when a person does not have sufficient fund to pay for the bill of exchange on the due date and he requires a further period of credit. Many a time instances do arise when the acceptor has spare funds much before the maturity date of the bill of exchange accepted by him. In such circumstances he approaches the payee of the bill of exchange and asks him whether the payee is prepared to accept cash before the maturity date. In such cases the acceptor gets a certain rebate or interest or discount for premature payment. The rebate becomes the income of the acceptor and expense of the payee. It is a consideration of premature payment. 15.INSOLVENCY Z₹1,010XX₹1,010Y'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 172}, page_content=\"Insolvency of a person means that he is unable to pay his liabilities. This means that bills accepted by him will be dishonoured. Therefore, when it is known that a person has become insolvent, entry for dishonour of his acceptance must be passed. Later on, something may be received from his estate. When and if an amount is received, cash account will be debited and the personal account of the debtor will be credited. The remaining amount will be irrecoverable and, therefore, should be written off as bad debt. The students should be careful to calculate the amount actually received from an insolvent's estate and amount to be written off only after preparing his account. In the books of drawee of the bill, the amount not ultimately paid by him due to insolvency, should be credited to Deficiency Account. 16.ACCOMMODATION BILLS Bills of Exchange are usually drawn to facilitate trade transmission, that is, bills are meant to finance actual purchase and sale of goods. But the mechanism of bill can be utilised to raise finance also. Suppose Boss needs finance for three months. In that case he may persuade his friend Kapoor to accept his draft. The bill of exchange may then be taken by Boss to his bank and get it discounted there. Thus, Boss will be able to make use of funds. When the three months period expires, Boss will send the requisite amount to Kapoor and Kapoor will meet the bill. Thus, Boss is able to raise money for his use. If both Boss and Kapoor need money, the same devise can be used. Either Boss accepts a bill of exchange or Kapoor does. In either case, the bill will be discounted with the bank and the proceeds divided between the two parties according to mutual agreement. The discounting charges must also be borne by the two parties in the same ratio in which the proceeds are divided. On the due date the acceptor will receive from the other party his share. The bill will then be met. When bills are used for such a purpose, they are known as accommodation bills. However, it may so happen that the drawer is not able to remit the proceeds to drawee on the due date. In such a case, the drawee may draw a bill on the drawer, and get it discounted with the bank to honour the first bill. If the new drawer (drawee of the first bill) also remits some proceeds of the new bill to new drawee (drawer of the first bill), then the proportion of discount to be borne by the new drawee will be based upon the proceeds remitted as well as the benefit obtained by him on the first bill (i.e., by not paying the amount due to the original drawee on due date). Entries are passed in the books of two parties exactly in the way already pointed out for ordinary bills. The only additional entry to be passed is for sending the remittance for one party to the other party and also debiting the other party with the shared amount of discount.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 173}, page_content='17.BILLS OF COLLECTION When a person receives a bill of exchange, he may decide to retain the bill till the date of maturity. But in order to ensure safety, he may send it to bank with instructions that the bill should be retained till maturity and should be realised on that date. This does not mean discounting because the bank will not credit the client until the amount is actually realised. If the bill is sent to the bank with such instructions it is known as \"Bill sent for collection\". It is better to make a record of this also in books by passing following entry: Bills for Collection Account Dr. To Bills Receivable Account When the amount is realised the entry will be Bank Account Dr. To Bills for Collection Account When the amount is not honoured, the entry will be Drawee\\'s A/c (from whom the bill was received) Dr. To Bills for collections  18.BILLS RECEIVABLE AND BILLS PAYABLE BOOKS Bills receivable and bills payable books are journals (Day Books) to record in a chronological order the details of bills receivable and bills payable. When large number of bill transactions take place in an organization, it is convenient to maintain these books. Wherein any bill transaction takes place, the same is entered in the Day Books in the first instance. Postings to individual Debtors or Creditors accounts are made from the Day Books. Also totals of bills received or accepted are posted periodically to Bills Receivable Account and Bills Payable Account respectively. Bills receivable book and bills payable book are very useful for following up the status of outstanding bills. When there are large number of bills and these bills fall due on different dates, some of these bills may not be honoured on maturity A/c'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 174}, page_content='due to varied reasons. It is possible from these Day Books to trace the details of the outstanding bills and to identify the reasons for not honouring the bills. Given below are forms of Day Books for both bills receivable and bills payable: Bills Receivable Book: This records the details of transactions where the company is entitled to receive money. When the company receives a bill, they record the date of receipt, the voucher number which references the transaction, the name of the party from whom the bill is received, whether it is an acceptance or a bill, the date of the bill, its due date for payment, the place where payment is to be made, the amount in rupees, the ledger folio (L.F.) number for tracking in financial statements, and the mode of disposal, which indicates how the bill was settled or cleared. Bills Payable Book: This logs the information of transactions where the company has to pay money to others. The company notes the date when they accept the obligation to pay, the drawer of the bill, the payee to whom the payment is to be made, the date of the bill, its due date, the place where the payment will be made, the amount in rupees, the ledger folio (L.F.) number for reference in financial ledgers, and the mode of disposal, detailing how the bill was handled or paid off.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 175}, page_content=\"CHAPTER 7 PREPARATION OF FINAL ACCOUNTS OF SOLE PROPRIETORS UNIT - 1 FINAL ACCOUNTS OF NON MANUFACTURING ENTITIES Unit Overview: Final Accounts of Non-Manufacturing Business Entities In the context of non-manufacturing business entities, the final accounts are crucial for determining the financial performance and position at the end of an accounting period. These accounts typically include: 1.Trading Account: This account is used to calculate the gross profit or loss of the business. It summarizes the costs of goods sold and the revenue from sales. The primary purpose of the trading account is to ascertain the effectiveness of the trading activities of the entity. 2.Profit & Loss Account: Following the trading account, the profit & loss account is prepared to determine the net profit or loss for the period. It takes into account all other incomes and expenses not included in the trading account, such as administrative expenses, selling expenses, and financial charges. 3.Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is a statement of the assets, liabilities, and capital of the business on the last day of the accounting period. It provides a snapshot of the entity's financial condition by listing its resources (assets) and obligations (liabilities). These final accounts are interrelated and provide comprehensive insight into the non-manufacturing business's financial results and status, serving as a basis for decision-making by stakeholders. 1.INTRODUCTION Non-manufacturing entities are the trading entities, which are engaged in the purchase and sale of goods for profit without changing the form/ underlying use of such goods. In other words, non-manufacturing entities do not process the goods purchased rather sell them in their original form. Meanwhile the entity indulges in some liabilities, makes some assets and also incurs some expenses like salaries, stationery expenses, advertisement, rent etc. to run the business. At the end of the accounting year, the entity must be interested in knowing the results of the business. To ascertain the final outcome of the business i.e., the income and financial position, they prepare financial statements at the end of the accounting year. Components of Financial Statements\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 176}, page_content=\"Financial statements are essential documents that provide information about a company's financial performance and position. The primary components of financial statements are: 1.Income Statement: This financial report provides details on the company's revenues and expenses over a specific accounting period, leading to the determination of profit or loss. It includes: Trading Account: This account reflects the results of the buying and selling of goods and services, leading to the calculation of gross profit or gross loss. Profit & Loss Account: It follows the trading account and shows all other incomes and expenses not included in the trading account. The result is the net profit or net loss for the period. 2.Position Statement: Also known as the balance sheet, this statement presents the company's financial position at a specific point in time and includes: Balance Sheet: This statement lists the company's assets, liabilities, and equity, providing a snapshot of what the company owns and owes. It reflects the position of assets and liabilities, showing how the resources are financed, either through debt or equity. These components together provide a comprehensive view of the company's financial health, performance, and stability. Financial Statements are the systematically organized summary of all the ledger account heads and presented in such a manner that it gives detailed information about the financial position and the performance of the entity. As seen above, through categorization of Financial Statements into Income & Position Statement, the profit or loss is measured at two levels: a)Gross Profit or Gross Loss b)Net Profit or Net Loss The profit or loss of the enterprise is obtained through the preparation of Income Statement i.e. Trading and Profit & Loss A/c The financial position of the business enterprise is assessed by measuring the assets, liabilities and capital of the enterprise and the same is communicated to the users of financial statements. Financial position of the enterprise can be known through the preparation of the Position Statement i.e Balance Sheet. Comparison between Income Statement and Position Statement Income Statement: The Income Statement presents the profit or loss at the financial year's end. It's split into two parts for non-manufacturing concerns: the Trading account, which\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 177}, page_content=\"deals with the direct costs and revenues related to sales, and the Profit and Loss account, which records indirect expenses and revenues, leading to the net profit or loss after considering all the income and expenditures incurred during the year. Position Statement: The Position Statement, commonly referred to as the balance sheet, shows the assets and liabilities of a business as of the financial year's end. To provide a fuller picture of financial health, entities might also prepare additional statements like the cash flow statement and changes in equity statement, which, while not mandatory for non-corporate entities, enhance understanding of the business's financial position, displaying the assets and liabilities as on a specific date. 2.PREPARATION OF FINAL ACCOUNTS The principal function of final accounts (Trading Account, Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet) is to exhibit truly and fairly the performance and the financial position of the business to which they relate. In order that these may be properly drawn up, it is essential that a proper record of transactions entered into by the business during a particular accounting period should be maintained. The BASIC PRINCIPLES in regard to accumulation of accounting period data are: i.a distinction should be made between capital and revenue receipts and payments. ii.income and expenses relating to a period of account should be separated from those of another period. iii.different items of income and expenditure should be accumulated under significant heads so as to disclose the sources from which capital has been procured and the nature of liabilities, which are outstanding for payment. Having regard to these basic principles, the various matters to which attention should be paid for determining the different aspects of transactions, a record of which should be kept, and the different heads of account under which various items of income and expenditure should be accumulated, are stated below: a)Distinction between personal and business income:- Since the final statements of account are intended to show the profitability of the business and not that of its proprietors, it is essential that all personal income and expenditure should be separated from business income and expenditure. b)Distinction between capital and revenue expenditure:- A distinction should be made between capital and revenue, both receipts and expenditure. Different types of income and expenditure should be classified\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 178}, page_content='under separate heads. Assets should be included in the Balance Sheet by following accounting principles and accounting standards. Likewise, a provision for expenses which have accrued but not paid, should be made by estimation or otherwise on the same basis as in the previous year. c)All material information to be disclosed:- Every information, considered material for evaluating the performance of the business or its financial position, should be disclosed. For example, when the labour charges have increased substantially on account of bonus having been paid to workmen, the amount of bonus paid should be disclosed. Similarly, If there are substantial write-offs in inventory due to any reason, it should be shown separately. d)Record only current period transactions:- Though the record of transactions should be maintained continuously, at the end of each accounting period, the transactions of the closing accounting period should be cut off from those of the succeeding period. e)Only transactions completed before close of accounts should be given effect:- It should be seen that only the effect of transactions, which were concluded before the close of period of account, has been adjusted in the accounts of the year. For example, when a sale of goods is to take place only after the goods have been inspected by the purchaser and the inspection had not been made before the close of the year, it would be incorrect to treat the goods as a sale in the accounts of the year. Inter-relationship of the two statements One of the points to be remembered is that of total expenditure incurred some type of expenditure appears in the Profit and Loss Account and some in the Balance Sheet. Consider few examples, 1.Salaries paid for current year is shown on the Dr. side of Profit and Loss Account but outstanding salaries is shown on liabilities side of Balance Sheet and is added to Salaries paid and shown under Profit and Loss Account. Profit & Loss Account: The Profit & Loss account records a total salary expense of ₹26,500. This comprises ₹25,000 in salaries that were paid during the period and an additional ₹1,500 in outstanding salaries that are yet to be paid. Balance Sheet:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 179}, page_content=\"In the Balance Sheet, the outstanding salaries of ₹1,500 are recognized under liabilities, indicating an obligation that the company has yet to fulfill as of the balance sheet date. 2.When a machine is purchased, that part of it which is attributable to the year considered as depreciation is debited to the Profit and Loss Account and the balance amount after reducing the amount of depreciation is shown in the Balance Sheet as an asset. Profit & Loss A/C: In the Profit and Loss Account, 'To Depreciation' indicates an expense of ₹50,000 which represents the cost of the reduction in value of fixed assets during the financial year. Balance Sheet: On the Balance Sheet, 'Fixed Assets' are initially recorded at a cost of ₹5,00,000. The 'Less: Depreciation' entry shows a deduction of ₹50,000 from the fixed assets, reflecting the depreciation expense recognized in the Profit & Loss Account, resulting in a net book value of ₹4,50,000 for the fixed assets. These illustrations show that the two statements, the Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet, are thoroughly inter-related. The assets shown in the Balance Sheet are mostly only the remainder of the expenditure incurred after a suitable amount has been charged to the Profit and Loss Account or the Trading Account. For preparing the two statements properly, it is of the greatest importance that the amounts to be charged to the Profit and Loss Account should be properly determined otherwise both statements will show an incorrect position. The principle that governs this concept is called the Matching Principle. Matching Principle This principle demands that expenses incurred to earn the revenue should be properly matched. This means the following: a)If a certain revenue and income is entered in the Trading / Profit and Loss Account all the expenses relating to it, whether or not payment has been actually made, should be debited to the Trading / Profit and Loss Account. This is why at the end of the year an entry is recorded to bring into account the outstanding expenses. That is also the reason why the opening inventory of goods is debited to the Trading Account since the relevant sale is credited in the same account. b)If some expense has been incurred but against it sale will take place in the next year or income will be received next year, the expense should not be\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 180}, page_content='debited to the current year\\'s Profit and Loss Account but should be carried forward as an asset and shown in the Balance Sheet. It will be debited to the Profit and Loss Account only when the relevant income will also be credited. The same reason applies to depreciation of assets also. The part of the cost which is used to earn current year revenue is debited in same year. c)If an income or revenue is received in the current year but the work against it has to be done and the cost in respect of it has to be incurred next year, i.e. income received in advance, such income or the revenue is considered to be of next year. It should be shown in the Balance Sheet on the liabilities side as \"income received in advance\" and should be credited to the Profit and Loss Account of the next year. E.g. Newspapers or magazines usually receive subscriptions in advance for a year. The part of subscription that covers copies to be supplied in the next year is treated as income received in advance. An exception There appears to be one exception to the rule that only such costs as have yielded or is expected to yield revenue should only be debited to Profit and Loss Account. For example, if a fire has occurred and has damaged the firm\\'s property the loss must be debited to the Profit and Loss Account to the extent it is not covered by insurance. A loss, resulting from the fall of selling price below the cost or from some debts turning bad, must similarly be debited to the Profit and Loss Account. If this is not done the profit will be over-stated. (NOTE: - The relevant entries and adjustments regarding the above three items are discussed in detail later in this unit.) 3.TRADING ACCOUNT At the end of the year, as has been seen above, it is necessary to ascertain the net profit or the net loss. For this purpose, it is first necessary to know the gross profit or gross loss. Gross Profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost of the goods sold. For a trading firm, the cost of goods sold can be ascertained by adjusting the cost of goods still on hand at the end of the year against the purchases. It is done as follow:- Opening Stock *** Add: Purchases (Net) ** Add: Direct Expenses **'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 181}, page_content='Less: Cost of Goods Sold (**) Closing Stock *** Suppose, in the first year, the net purchases (that is after deducting returns) total  and that  worth of goods (at cost) were not sold at the end of the year. The cost of the goods sold will then be . If in the next year purchases are , direct expenses are  and the cost of goods sold is  the closing stock will be  calculated as follows: Cost of unsold goods at the beginning of the year 15,000 Purchases during the year  Direct Expenses   Less: Cost of sold goods during the year  Closing Stock  Gross profit is usually ascertained by preparing a Trading account. The format of Trading Account can be shown as below:- Trading Account for the year ended: Debit Side: To Opening Stock: XXX To Purchases: XXX Less: Returns outward: XXX To Direct Expenses: Freight & Carriage: XXX Customs & Insurance: XXX Wages: XXX Gas, Water & Fuel: XXX Factory Expenses: XXX Royalty on Production: XXX Total Direct Expenses: XXX ₹1,00,000₹15,000₹85,000₹1,50,000₹10,000₹1,45,000₹30,0001,50,00010,000_1,75,0001,45,000(30,000)'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 182}, page_content='Credit Side: By Sales: XXX Less: Returns Inwards: XXX By Closing Stock: XXX By Gross Loss c/d*: XXX To Gross Profit c/d* *Only one will appear If in the above example net sales, i.e., after adjustment for sales returns, is ₹ 2,00,000 then the gross profit will be ₹ 55,000 , i.e., ₹2,00,000 - ₹ . This profit is called gross profit since from it indirect expenses have still to be deducted for knowing the net profit. Now, for the same example Trading account will appear as follows:- Trading Account for the year ending To Opening Inventory: ₹15,000 To Purchase Account: ₹1,50,000 To Direct Expenses: ₹10,000 To Gross Profit carried to P & L A/c: ₹55,000 Total: ₹2,30,000 By Sales Account: ₹2,00,000 By Closing Inventory: ₹30,000 Total: ₹2,30,000 Point to Remember:- •The opening inventory and purchases are written on the debt side. •Sales and the closing inventory are entered on the credit side. •If there are any direct expenses then they should also be written on the debit side of the Trading account. 1,45,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 183}, page_content='•If the balances of credit side is more, the difference is written on the debit side as gross profit. This amount will also be carried forward to the Profit and Loss Account on the credit side. •In case of gross loss, i.e., when the debit side of the Trading Account exceeds the credit side, the amount will be written on the credit side of the Trading Account and transferred to the debit side of the Profit and Loss Account. Trading Account Items In a trading firm like a wholesaler, the main business consists of buying and selling the same goods. In addition to the amount of the opening inventory, the trading account will also be debited with all expenses incurred in bringing the goods to the godown of the firm (i.e. to the present condition and location) and in making them ready for sale. For example, freight paid on purchases, cartage, octroi, etc. will all be debited to the Trading Account. The rule is that this account will be debited with all expenses incurred in bringing the goods to their present location and condition. We shall now consider individual items: 1.Opening Inventory: Since this was closing inventory of the last year, it must have been entered in the opening inventory account, through the opening entry. Therefore, it will be found in the trial balance. This item is usually put as the first item on the debit side of the Trading Account. Of course, in the first year of a business there will be no opening inventory.

The purchase returns account will have credit balance showing the return of materials to the supplier.

However, to correctly ascertain the gross profit, the closing Inventories must be properly taken and valued. The entry is Closing Inventory Account Dr. To Trading Account Alternatively, Closing Inventory can be adjusted with purchases : Closing Inventory Account Dr. To Purchases Account The effect of this entry is to reduce the debit in the Purchases Account. The closing inventory is also shown in balance sheet on Assets side. If Closing Stock appears in the Trial balance:- The closing inventory is then not entered in the trading account, it is shown only in the balance sheet. This is because it has already been adjusted to arrive at Cost of Goods Sold. To ascertain value of the closing inventory, it is necessary to make a complete inventory or list of all the items in the godown together with quantities. Of course, damaged or obsolete items are separately listed. To the list of finished goods, one should also add the goods lying with agents sent to them on consignment basis and also the goods sent on approval to customer. The valuation principle is cost or net realisable value whichever is lower. Taking inventory is quite a lengthy process. Strictly, immediately at the end of the year the taking of inventory should be completed. Sometimes, however this is done either a few weeks before or a few weeks after the closing. In such a case the'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 186}, page_content='value of the inventory thus taken must be adjusted to relate it to the closing date.

If we understand word 'expenses' properly, there should be no difficulty in distinguishing between items that will be debited to the Profit and Loss Account and those that will be shown as Assets in the balance sheet. Further, it may be noted that the expenses which are personal in nature will not be charged to Profit and Loss A/c. Only those revenue expenses and losses which are related to the current year, are debited to Profit and Loss Account. It is desirable, according to modern thinking that the Profit and Loss Account should be prepared in such a manner as will enable the reader to form a correct idea about the profit earned or loss incurred by the firm during the period together with the significant factor. Too many details will prevent a person from knowing properly the factors leading to the profit earned. Therefore, items should be according to the various functions, such as administrations, selling and financing.

CLOSING ENTRIES The entries that have to be made in the journal for preparing the Trading and the Profit and Loss Account that is for transferring the various accounts to these two accounts are known as closing entries. We have already seen the entries required for preparing the Trading Account and for transferring the gross profit to the profit and Loss Account. Now to complete the Profit and Loss Account, the under mentioned three entries will be necessary. a)For items to be debited to the Profit and Loss Account this account will be debited and the various accounts concerned will be credited. For example, Profit and Loss Account Dr. To Salaries Account To Rent Account To Interest Account To Other Expenses Account b)Items of income or gain such as interest received or miscellaneous income will be credited to Profit and Loss Account. Discount Received Account Dr. Bad debts Recovered Account Dr. To Profit and Loss Account c)At this stage, the Profit and Loss Account will show net profit or net loss.

However, interest on fixed deposits, interests or income from investments and other interest should be shown separately. Similarly, items which have to be debited/credited to the proprietor should be segregated from other items. Examples would be interest charged on drawings, interest allowed on capital and charges for services rendered by the firm to the proprietor personally. We shall now consider a few items individually: i.Drawings: Drawings are not expenses for the firm but reduction of capital and therefore should not be debited to the Profit and Loss Account but to Capital account of the proprietor. Capital A/C Dr. To Drawings If the proprietor has enjoyed some benefit personally, like use of the firm's car, a suitable amount should be treated as drawing and to that extent the charge to the Profit and Loss Account will be reduced, Drawings are debited to the proprietor's capital account. ii.Income Tax: In case of companies, the income tax payable is treated like other expenses. But in the case of sole proprietorship, income tax is treated as a personal expense. It is debited to the Capital Account and not to the Profit and Loss Account.

In case of partnership business, firm's tax liability is to be debited to profit and loss account of the firm but partners' tax liability are not to be borne by the firm. Therefore if the firm pays income tax on behalf of partners, such payment of personal income tax should be treated as drawings. iii.Discount received and allowed: We have already seen that discount is of two types. Trade discount and Cash discount. Trade discount is allowed when the order for goods is not below a certain figure. It is deducted from the invoice. Only the net amount of invoice is entered in books. There is no further treatment of the trade discount. Cash discount is allowed to a customer if he makes the payment before a certain date. It is allowance made to him for prompt payment and is recorded in the books. Therefore, Trade discount is not debited to  account because it is already adjusted in sales, but cash discount is debited to  account. Discount received is a gain and is credited to the Profit and Loss Account while discount allowed is a loss and debited to Profit and Loss Account.

As such before final accounts are drawn up, it must be ensured that the accounts which require adjustment on this consideration have been adjusted, both by providing for expense accrued and including income outstanding and excluding expenses the benefit of which extends beyond the year of account as well as the income received in advance. The entries that must be passed for adjusting various accounts of income and expenditure are shown below: 1)Expenses accrued and accruing, e.g., Rent, Interest, Local Taxes, Wages etc. Appropriate Expense Account Dr. To Expenses Accrued/outstanding Account For Example, if Rent Paid is ₹ 50,000 for a year and Outstanding Rent is ₹ 14,000 .

If the due date of payment occurs in the current accounting period the term used should be \"outstanding\" or \"accrued and due\". b.The expression accrued and accruing\\' signifies items which though not due for payment but pertain to the period of account, a provision for which has been made. Converse is the position so far as items of income are concerned. 3)Carrying forward income received in advance e.g., Subscription in the case of a club or fees in case of professional person.

Where an examination problem requires that certain bad debts should be written off and a provision for doubtful debts made, the amount of bad debts to be written off should be first debited against the existing balance of the provision and the resulting balance in the account afterwards should be raised to the required figure. The method is illustrated below: 7)Provision for Discount: This provision is created in the same manner, discussed above but the amount of provision is required to be calculated after deducting the Provision for Bad Debts from the total trade receivables. This is because Provision for discount is created only on good debtors. For Example, if Trade Receivables is  and provision for doubtful debt is .

The last mentioned balance would be included on the debit side of the Trial Balance. Students should, as a matter of course, record on the rough working sheets, adjustments in respect of various items stated in a question and then give their effect in the Trial Balance, before proceeding to draw up the Final Accounts. 5.CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS AND THEIR TREATMENTS 1.Abnormal loss of Inventory by accident or fire: Sometimes loss of goods occurs due to fire, theft, etc. If due to accident or fire, a portion of Inventory is damaged, the value of loss is first to be ascertained. Thereafter, Abnormal Loss Account is to be debited and Purchase Account or Trading Account is to be credited. Abnormal Loss Account is to be transferred to Profit & Loss Account. If amount of loss is recoverable from insurance company, then insurance company is to be debited instead of Profit & Loss Account. Till the money is not received from the insurance company, Insurance Company's Account will be shown in the Assets side of the Balance Sheet. If any part of the loss is recoverable from the insurance company, then the portion not compensated by the insurance company should be debited to Profit & Loss Account. For example, if goods worth ₹ 6,000 are destroyed by fire and the insurance company admits the claim for ₹ 4,500, the Journal entries will be:- i.Loss by Fire Account Dr. 6,000 To Purchases/Trading Account 6,000 ii.Insurance Company's A/c (Insurance Claim) Dr.  Profit & Loss A/c Dr.  To Loss by Fire A/c 6,000 \\xa04,500\\xa01,500\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 199}, page_content='Profit/Loss Account: To Loss by Fire: ₹1,500 (The amount not compensated by insurance company) Balance Sheet: Asset: Insurance Claim: ₹4,500 In the Trading Account, Purchases will be reduced by 6,000. 2.Goods sent on Approval basis: Sometimes goods are sold to customers on sale or return basis or on approval basis. It should not be treated as actual sale till the time it is not approved by the customer. When goods were sold we have passed the entry for actual sales. Therefore, at the year end, if the goods are still lying with the customers for approval, following entries are to be passed: For example - i.Goods costing  sent to a customer on sale or return basis for ₹12,000. The entry for such unapproved sale shall be- Sales A/c                                  Dr.                           To Trade receivables                               12,000 ii.Stock on approval                    Dr.  To Trading A/C                                                         10,000          These goods should now be included in the amount of Closing Stock at their cost  price. 3.Goods used other than for sale: Sometimes goods are used for some other purposes, such as distributed as free samples, used in construction of any assets or used by proprietor for personal use. In such cases the amount used for other purposes is subtracted from Purchases  and depending upon the specific use done, the suitable account head is debited. For example:- When goods are given away as donation- Donation A/C                                                                                       Dr. To Purchases A/c When goods are used by the proprietor for his personal use- Drawings A/C                                                                                Dr. ₹10,000\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa012,000A/cA/c\\xa010,000A/c'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 200}, page_content='To Purchases A/C When goods are distributed as free samples :- Free Samples / Advertisement A/c                                              Dr. To Purchases A/C When goods are used in business for construction of Building or the Machinery :- Building A/c / Plant & Machinery A/c                                           Dr. To Purchases A/c When goods are used for maintenance of business premises/ Machinery: - Repair & Maintenance A/C                                                                Dr. To Purchases A/c 4.Commission based on profit: Sometimes commission is payable to manager based on net profit; in such a case calculation is done as follows: i.Commission on net profit before charging such commission = Profit before commission  ii.Commission on net profit after charging such commission = Profit before commission  Commission is recorded by following journal entry Commission A/C                                                            Dr. To Commission Payable A/C (Being commission payable to Mr ..... @ .....% on net profit after charging such commission, net profit before charging commission being ₹........)

That is the significance of the word \"as at.\" The assets are shown on the right hand side and liabilities and capital on the left hand side. CHARACTERISTICS The balance sheet has certain characteristics, which should be noted. These are the following: i.It is prepared at a particular date, rather the close of a day and not for a period. It is true only on that date and not later. Suppose, in the example given above, a part of the goods were sold on 1st April, 2021. This will mean that the value of the Inventory will be reduced, the cash in hand will increase and the capital account will be reduced or increased depending upon loss or profit on sale. ii.The balance sheet is prepared only after the preparation of the Profit and Loss Account. This is the reason why the Profit and Loss Account (including the Trading Account) and the Balance Sheet are together called Final ₹1,00,00010%=₹10,00010%₹1,00,000)\\n10%=9,090.90₹1,00,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 202}, page_content='Accounts (of course, the Balance Sheet is not an account, the two sides are not the debit and the credit sides.) Without being accompanied by the Profit and Loss Account, the Balance Sheet will not be able to throw adequate light on the financial position of the firm. For that purpose an appreciation of the profits of the firm is necessary. iii.Since capital always equals the difference between assets and liabilities and since the capital account will independently arrive at this figure, the two sides of the Balance Sheet must have the same totals. If it is not so, there is certainly an error somewhere. In the illustration no. 5 worked out above it will be seen that the under mentioned accounts have not been closed even after preparation of the Profit and Loss Account and the transfer of the net profit to the capital account. Cash in Hand: ₹1,44,000 (Debit balance) Capital Accounts: ₹16,30,000 (Credit balance, aggregated from ₹10,00,000 and ₹6,30,000) Machinery Account: ₹7,36,000 (Debit balance) Trade receivables: ₹8,50,000 (Debit balance) Trade payables: ₹3,70,000 (Credit balance) Inventories: ₹2,70,000 (Debit balance) Looking at these accounts, one would know that various assets: Cash balance in hand, cash at bank, machinery, furniture etc. that the firm possesses and the amounts that are owing as liability to trade payables and to the proprietor as capital. The capital, of course, will be the difference between the total of assets and of liabilities. The assets, liabilities and capital are usually presented in a statement called the Balance Sheet. This is given below for the accounts mentioned above. C.

Those assets, which are most difficult in this respect, are presented at the bottom. As per Liquidity the balance sheet can be prepared as follow:- Balance Sheet as at... Balance Sheet as at [date]: Liabilities: Bills Payable: [Amount] Trade Creditors: [Amount] Loans: [Amount] Outstanding Expenses: [Amount] Reserves & Surplus: [Amount] Capital: [Amount] Assets: Cash in Hand: [Amount] Cash at Bank: [Amount] Government Securities: [Amount] Other Investments: [Amount] Bills Receivable: [Amount] Sundry Debtors: [Amount]'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 204}, page_content='Stock: [Amount] Furniture & Fixtures: [Amount] Plant & Machinery: [Amount] Land and Building: [Amount] ii.Permanence: Assets, which are to be used, for long term in the business and are not meant to be sold are presented first. Assets, which are most liquid, such as cash in hand, are presented at the bottom. Balance Sheet as at: Liabilities: Capital Reserves & Surplus Outstanding Expenses Loans Trade Creditors Bills Payable Assets: Land and Building Plant & Machinery Furniture & Fixtures Stock Sundry Debtors Bills Receivable Other Investments Government Securities Cash at Bank Cash in Hand'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 205}, page_content='Note:- Some of the assets may be capable of being sold easily like investment in government securities or shares of some companies. They should be treated as liquid or permanent according to the intention of the firm. 2)Liabilities: Liabilities may also be shown according to the urgency with which payment has to be made. One way is to first show the capital, then long-term liabilities and last of all short term liabilities like amounts due to suppliers of goods or bills payable. The other way is to start with short-term liabilities and then show long term liabilities and last of all capital. CLASSIFICATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Assets are basically of following types: Current Assets: - these assets are meant to be converted into cash as quickly as possible. Generally, within one year. For example:- Cash in hand, Cash at Bank, Trade receivables, Inventories. Long Term Assets: - Those that are meant to be used by the firm over a long period and not sold the former type of assets is also called fixed assets. For example:- Machinery, Building, Long term Investment. Intangible Assets: - the assets which have no physical existence and cannot be seen or touched are called as Intangible Assets. For example :- Patents, Copyrights etc. It is desirable that in the balance sheet the two types of assets should be shown separately and prominently. This would give meaningful and logical information. Liabilities to outsider will be of two types: Current Liabilities: - this liability must be settled in one year or less. It is also called as shortterm liability. For example: - Creditors, Bills Payable etc. Long Term Liability: - those liabilities which exists for more than one year are Long term liabilities. For example long term loans from banks. Of course, it will include undistributed profits also. Sole proprietors generally present Balance Sheet in a horizontal form with \"Capital and Liabilities\" on the left hand side and \\'Assets\\' on the right-hand side. In the Balance Sheet the various items should be grouped suitably as indicated below: Balance Sheet as on: Liabilities:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 206}, page_content='Capital A/C: Balance Add: Net Profit/Less: Net Loss Less: Drawings Long Term Loans: Term Loans Other Loans Short Term Loans: Cash Credit Overdrafts Other Loans Current Liabilities: Trade payables Outstanding Expenses Advances Taken Provision: Provision for Bad debts Provision for Retirement Benefits Provision for Taxation Assets: Tangible Fixed Assets: Land and Building Plant and Machinery Vehicles Furniture and Fixture Intangibles: Goodwill Patent Rights Designs and Brand Names Investments: Long term investments Current Assets:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 207}, page_content='Inventory in Trade Trade receivables Short term investments Prepayments Advances Bank Balances Cash In Hand In course, there is no hard and fast rule regarding presentation of assets, liabilities and equities in the Balance sheet. However, the model presentation shown above has been designed considering the nature of Balance Sheet elements and categorizing them appropriately. Proper presentation of Balance Sheet items improves understandability of the information desired to be communicated to the users of account. 7.SEQUENCE OF ACCOUNTING PROCEDURE OR THE ACCOUNTING CYCLE What has been done so far shows that the accounting process in the following order: i.recording the transactions in the journal or journalising; ii.preparing ledger accounts on the basis of the journal or posting into the ledger; iii.taking out the trial balance to check arithmetical accuracy; iv.preparing the trading and profit and loss account or the income statement for the period concerned; and v.preparing the balance sheet to show the financial position at the end of the period. 8.OPENING ENTRY We have seen that on commencing a new business one debits the cash account and credits the capital account with the amount introduced. A firm closes the books of account at the end of each year and starts new books in the beginning of each year. The first entry in the journal is to record the closing balances of various assets and liabilities at the end of the previous year as the opening balances in the beginning of the new year. The balance sheet prepared at the end of the year records these balances and is the basis for this first entry. It is called the opening entry.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 208}, page_content='The assets shown in the balance sheet are debited and the liabilities and the capital account credited. 9.PROVISIONS AND RESERVES Provision means \"any amount written off or retained by way of providing for depreciation, renewal or diminution in the value of assets or retained by way of providing for any known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with substantial accuracy\". A provision is a liability which can be measured only by using a substantial degree of estimation. Thus, a provision may be either in respect of loss in the value of an asset provided or written off on the basis of an estimate or the one in respect of a liability for expenses incurred in respect of a claim which is disputed i.e. when it is a contingent liability. On the occurrence of a diminution in asset values due to some of them having become irrecoverable or Inventory items are lost as a result of some natural calamity, amounts contributed or transferred from profit to make good the diminution also are described as provision. The following are instances of amount retained in the business out of earning for different purposes that are described as provisions. 1)Amount provided for meeting claims which are admissible in principle, but the amount whereof has not been ascertained. 2)An appropriation made for payment of taxes still to be assessed. 3)Amount set aside for writing off bad debts or payment of discounts. The portion of earnings, receipts or other surplus of an enterprise (whether capital or revenue) appropriated by the management for a general or a specific purpose other than a provision for depreciation or diminution in the value of assets or for a known liability is known as reserves. The reserves are primarily of two types: capital reserves and revenue reserves. Also provisions in excess of the amount considered necessary for the purposes these were originally made, are to be considered as reserves. It is thus evident that provisions are a charge against profits, while reserve is an appropriation of profits. Also provisions that ultimately prove to be in excess of amounts required or have been made too liberally are reserves. Such a distinction is essential for disclosing truly in the Balance Sheet the amount by which the equity of shareholders has increased with the accumulation of undistributed profits. Reserve Fund: It signifies the amount standing to the credit of the reserve that is invested outside the business in securities which are readily realisable e.g., when the amounts set apart for replacement of an asset are invested periodically, in government securities or shares. The account to which these amounts are annually credited is described as the Reserve Fund.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 209}, page_content='10.LIMITATIONS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial statements suffer from a number of limitations. These must, therefore, be studied with care, in order that correct inferences may be drawn. The limitations are less serious if the objective is only to appraise the performance of a single company over a period of year Where, however, a comparison of the working of different companies for the same period is to be made. It can be misleading unless the companies concerned have followed the same system and basis of accounting. On the account, a comparison of the performancey of different industries on the basis of financial statements, should be undertaken only if it is not practicable to make such a comparison on any other basis. The principal limitations affecting financial statements are the following: a)Historical Cost: Accounting records and, on that account, the financial statements are prepared only on the basis of the money value prevailing at the time the transaction were entered into. Thus, the effect of subsequent changes in the value of money is not taken into account. At times this has the effect of making the statements of account quite misleading. Take the obvious example of a house built in 1980, say at the cost of , in 2022 the benefit receivable from its occupation will be as much as that of a house created in 2022 , say at a cost of . If the house were included in the financial statements at its original cost, as normally it would not convey a true picture except to a knowledgeable person. The limitations can be serious in the case of other fixed assets that have been working over a long period over which prices have changed radically. It is, however, not easy to get over this difficulty, since revaluation of fixed assets, apart from being costly is not practicable when the value of money is continuously falling. On this account, historical cost continues to be the accepted basis for the preparation of financial statements. Though it may not be possible to do much to remove the limitation mentioned above, one must always remember to read the balance sheet and the profit and loss account in the light of what they cannot reveal as well as what they do. b)Intangible strengths and weaknesses: A company may have a number of strengths and weaknesses which cannot be shown in the balance sheet e.g., the loyalty and calibre of its staff. These must be kept in mind while judging the financial position of the company. c)Perpetual continuity and periodical account: Financial statements ordinarily are drawn up at the end of each year but the accounting record is maintained on the assumption that the business undertaking shall continue to exist forever on the basis of going concern assumption. In consequence, much of the expenditure other than revenue expenditure has to be distributed arbitrarily over a number of years during which benefit of the ₹15,000₹30,00,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 210}, page_content=\"expenditure is expected to arise. As a result, financial statements of account are not absolutely correct. d)Different accounting policies: It is permissible for a company within certain limits to adopt different policies for the preparation of accounts, valuation of various assets and distribution of expenditure over different periods of account. For example, a company may decide to provide annually for payment of pensions and gratuities to staff and thus build up a 'fund' out of which payments will be made ultimately whereas another company may deal with these only when actual payments are made. Similarly, a company may decide whether or not to include intangible assets amongst its assets or manner in which the amounts thereof should be written off. e)Management policies: Management can have different accounting policies for welfare of the staff and public at large. \\nUNIT - 2 FINAL ACCOUNTS OF MANUFACTURING ENTITIES 2.1.INTRODUCTION\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 211}, page_content='The manufacturing entities generally prepare a separate Manufacturing Account as a part of Final accounts in addition to Trading Account, Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet. The objective of preparing Manufacturing Account is to determine manufacturing costs of finished goods for assessing the cost effectiveness of manufacturing activities. Manufacturing costs of finished goods are then transferred from the Manufacturing Account to Trading Account.  a)Trading account shows Gross Profit while Manufacturing Account shows cost of goods sold which includes direct expenses. b)Manufacturing account also deals with the raw materials, and work in progress while the trading account would deal with finished goods only. 2.2.PURPOSE A manufacturing account serves the following functions: 1)It shows the total cost of manufacturing the finished products and sets out in detail, with appropriate classifications, the constituent elements of such cost. It is, therefore, debited with the cost of materials, manufacturing wages and expenses incurred directly or indirectly to manufacture. 2)It provides details of factory cost and facilitates reconciliation of financial books with cost records. It also serves as a basis of comparison of manufacturing operations from period to period. 3)The Manufacturing Account may also be used for various other purposes. For example, if the output is carried to the Trading Account at market prices, it shows the profit or loss on manufacture. Similarly, it may also be used to fix the amount of production linked bonus when such schemes are in force. 2.3.MANUFACTURING COSTS Manufacturing costs are classified into:  Raw Material consumed is arrived at after adjustment of opening and closing Inventory of raw materials: \\xa0+\\xa0Raw\\xa0Material\\xa0Consumed\\xa0\\xa0+\\xa0Direct\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0Wages\\xa0\\xa0+\\xa0Direct\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0Expenses\\xa0\\xa0+\\xa0Direct\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0Cost\\xa0\\xa0+\\xa0Indirect\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0expenses\\xa0or\\xa0\\xa0+\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0Overhead\\xa0\\xa0Total\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0Cost'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 212}, page_content='Raw Material Consumed  Opening inventory + Purchases - Closing inventory of Raw Materials of Raw Materials If there remain unfinished goods at the beginning and at the end of the accounting period, cost of such unfinished goods (also termed as Work-In-Process) is shown in the Manufacturing Account. Opening inventory of Work-in-Process is posted to the debit of the Manufacturing Account and closing inventory of Work-in-Process is posted to the credit of the Manufacturing Account. DIRECT MANUFACTURING EXPENSES Direct manufacturing expenses are costs, other than material or wages, which are incurred for a specific product or saleable service. Examples of direct manufacturing expenses are (i) Royalties for using license or technology if based on units produced, (ii) Hire charge of the plant and machinery used on hire, if based on units produced, etc. When royalty or hire charges are based on units produced, these expenses directly vary with production. INDIRECT MANUFACTURING EXPENSES OR OVERHEAD EXPENSES These are also called Manufacturing overhead, Production overhead, Works overhead, etc. Overhead is defined as total cost of indirect material, indirect wages and indirect expenses. Overhead = Indirect Material + Indirect Wages + Indirect Expenses Indirect material means materials which cannot be linked directly with the units produced, for example, stores consumed for repair and maintenance work, small tools, fuel and lubricating oil, etc. Indirect wages are those which cannot be directly linked to the units produced, for example, wages for maintenance works, holding pay, etc. Indirect expenses are those which cannot be directly linked to the units produced, for example, training expenses, depreciation of plant and machinery, depreciation of factory shed, insurance premium for plant and machinery, factory shed, etc. Accordingly, indirect manufacturing expenses comprise indirect material, indirect wages and indirect expenses of the manufacturing division. ='), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 213}, page_content='BY-PRODUCTS In most manufacturing operations, the production of the main product is accompanied by the production of a subsidiary product which has a value on sale. For example, the production of hydrogenated vegetable oil is accompanied by the production of oxygen gas and the production of steel yields scrap. The subsidiary product is termed as a by-product because its production is not consciously undertaken but results out of the production of the main product. It is usually very difficult to ascertain the cost of the product. Moreover, its value usually forms a very small percentage of the main product. By-product is a secondary product. This is produced from the same raw materials, which are used for producing the main product and without incurring any additional expenses from the same production process in which the main product is produced. Some examples of byproduct are given below: i.Molasses is the by-product in sugar manufacturing; ii.Butter milk is the by-product of a dairy which produces butter and cheese, etc. By-products generally have insignificant value as compared to the value of main product. They are generally valued at net realizable value, if their costs cannot be separately identified. It is often treated, as Other Operating income\" but the correct treatment would be to credit the sale value of the by-product to Manufacturing Account so as to reduce to that extent, the cost of manufacture of main product. 2.4.DESIGN OF A MANUFACTURING ACCOUNT There is no standardized design for the presentation of a Manufacturing Account.

Instead, details are given regarding the number of items in Inventories, quantity manufactured etc. the figures for Inventories, sales etc., would therefore have to be worked out independently from the data given. The following general rules may be observed. (a)The Manufacturing Account should have columns showing the quantities and values. Frequently, all the quantities are not given and the quantities applicable to one or more of the items would have to be worked out. For example, if the question does not state the total number of items sold, the quantity can be worked out by adding opening inventory and units manufactured and deducting closing inventory. It is, therefore, useful to have quantity columns in the account so that it can be seen that both sides balance. (b)The Manufacturing Account will show the quantity of raw materials in inventory at the beginning and at the end of the year and the purchases during the year. As regards finished goods, it will only show the quantity manufactured and, as regards work-in-progress, the opening and closing amounts. (c)The Trading Account will show the quantities of finished goods manufactured and sold and the opening and closing inventory. It will not show the quantity of raw materials or workin-progress. (d)For determining the value of closing inventory, in the absence of specific instruction to the contrary, it must be assumed that sales have been on \"first'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 215}, page_content='in-first out\" basis, that is, the closing inventory consists as far as possible of goods produced during the year, the opening inventory being sold out. It may be mentioned here that nowadays no manufacturing business entity prepares manufacturing account as part of its final set of accounts. Even the items of manufacturing account are shown either in trading account (in case of non-corporate entities) or in Statement of profit and loss (in case of corporate entities). The procedure of preparation of Trading Account, Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet have already been explained in Unit 1 of this chapter. Students should refer the earlier unit for attempting the problems based on the preparation of complete set of final accounts of a sole proprietor. \\nCHAPTER 8'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 216}, page_content='FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOF NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANISATIONS 1.INTRODUCTION A non-profit organization is a legal accounting entity that is operated for the benefit of the society as a whole, rather than for the benefit of a sole proprietor or a group of partners or shareholders. The main motive behind the non-profitable organization is to render service to the society or the members of the organisation. There is difference in the final accounts prepared between the profit making and the nonprofitable organisations. The sources of receipts and payments also vary with the nature of the activity that is being carried on by the organisation. Non-profit making organisations such as public hospitals, public educational institutions, clubs, Temples, churches etc., as a part of their final accounts prepare Receipts and Payments Account and Income and Expenditure Account to show periodic performance (either surplus or deficit) and Balance Sheet to show financial position at the end of the period. In this Chapter, we shall discuss the technique of preparing Receipts and Payments Account, Income and Expenditure Accounts and Balance Sheet of not-for-profit organisations. The Income and Expenditure Account (non- profitable organisation) is just similar to Profit and Loss Account prepared for the profit making organisations but there has been different terminology employed for the word Profit as SURPLUS - excess of income over expenditure or loss as DEFICIT - excess of expenditure over income. In non-profit making organisations, total cash receipts and total cash payments are highlighted through Receipts and Payments Account. 2.NATURE OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS ACCOUNT A Receipts and Payments Account is a summary of the cash book without date column. It is an elementary form of account commonly adopted by not for profit making concerns such as hospitals, clubs, societies, temples, churches etc., for presenting the receipts and payments periodically together with the cash balances at the beginning and close of the period. The receipts are entered on the left hand side, and payments on the right hand side i.e., the same way as they appear in Cash Book. \"The main point to be noted here is that- receipts and payments account is not based on the accrual system of book keeping as it records all the receipts and payments whether capital or revenue, pertaining to the current, previous or future periods.\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 217}, page_content='Features: •It is the summary of the cash and bank transactions like cash book, all the receipts (capital or revenue) are debited, similarly, all the expenditures (capital or revenue) are credited. •It starts with opening cash and bank balances and also ends with their closing balances. This account is usually not a part of the double entry system as it includes all cash and bank receipts and payments, whether they are related to present, past or future periods. •Surplus or deficit for an accounting period cannot be ascertained from this account, since, it shows only the Cash/Bank position and excludes all non cash items. 2.1 Limitations of Receipts and Payments Account From the study of the above account, it is apparent that the increase in the cash and bank balances at the end of the year, as compared to those in beginning, does not truly represent the surplus for the year since it does not take into account the other important transactions, such as cost of construction of the pavilion, which is in excess of the donation received, the outstanding subscription or those which were collected in advance, etc. Another important drawback is that the Receipts and Payments Account includes items relating to all periods and of all types whether capital or revenue. In order to ascertain whether the organisation has made surplus or deficit, there is a need to construct an account which considers all the relevant revenue transactions for the current period. Since the Receipts and payments account does not consider the above, its preparation is not favoured except where the activities of the organization, the results of which are to be exhibited, are simple and modest, involve no carry over from one period to the next and it has no assets, apart from cash balance and no liabilities. 3.INCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT The income and expenditure account is equivalent to the Profit and Loss Account of a Profit making business enterprise. It is an account which is widely adopted by most of the Nonprofit making concerns and is prepared by following accrual principle. Only items of revenue nature pertaining to the current period of account are included. The preparation of the account, therefore, requires adjustments in relevant accounts in respect of both outstanding and advance items of income and expenditure. The only difference is in the terms used to represent the profit and loss. Profit is termed as Surplus- Excess of income over expenditure and loss is termed as Deficit- Excess of expenditure over income.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 218}, page_content='Non-profit organizations registered under section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013 are required to prepare their Income and Expenditure account and Balance Sheet as per the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Features: •It is a revenue account prepared at the end of the accounting period for finding out the surplus or deficit of that period. •It is prepared by matching expenses against the revenue of that period concerned. •Both cash and non-cash items, such as depreciation, are taken into consideration. •All capital expenditures and incomes are excluded. •Only current years\\' income and expenses are considered. This Surplus/deficit is taken to the balance sheet and is added / deducted respectively with the capital fund (opening balance). 3.1.Main Sources of Income For a not for profit organisation, the sources of income, largely depend on the nature of the activity carried on by them. The income for a charitable hospital is different from that of a income received by a sports club. Broadly for the purposes of solving the illustrations, we can classify the sources of income as subscriptions, ordinary donations, membership fees or entrances fees (if the amount is normal or provided according to bye-laws of the society), recurring grants from local authorities and income from investments, etc. Any amount raised for a special activity, e.g. on sale of match tickets, is deducted from the expenditure of that activity and net amount is shown in the income and expenditure account. Any receipt of capital nature shall not be shown as income but will be credited to the Capital Fund or special purpose fund e.g. \"Building Fund\\' or if the receipts is on account of sale of a fixed asset, it shall be credited to the asset account. This system of showing the donation towards specific purposes separately is termed as fund accounting. 3.2.Distinction between Receipts and Payments Account and Income and Expenditure Account Not for profit organizations such as public hospitals, public educational institutions, clubs, Temples, churches etc., conventionally prepare Receipt and Payment Account and Income and Expenditure Account to show periodic performance for a particular accounting period. The distinguishing features of both the accounts can be summarized as:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 219}, page_content='Receipt and Payment Account is an elementary form of account consisting of a classified summary of cash receipts and payments over a certain period together with cash balances at the beginning and close of the period. The receipts are entered on the left hand side and payments on the right hand side i.e. same sides as those on which they appear in cash book. All the receipts and payments whether of revenue or capital nature are included in this account. The receipts and payments pertaining to the current, previous or future periods are also considered here. The balance of the account at the end of a period represents the difference between the amount of cash received and paid up. It is always in debit since it is made up of cash in hand and at bank. Income and expenditure account resembles and is drawn in the same form of a Profit and loss account in case of profit-making organisations. Expenditure of revenue nature is shown on the debit side, income and gains of revenue nature are shown on the credit side. Income and Expenditure Account contains all the items of income and expenditure relevant to the current accounting period only, whether received or paid as well as that which have fallen due for recovery or payment. Capital Receipts, prepayments of income and capital expenditures, prepaid expenses are excluded. It does not start with any opening balance. The balancing figure represents the amount by which the income exceeds the expenditure or vice versa. 3.3.Preparation of Income and Expenditure Account from Receipts and Payments Account Situations may require compilation of Income and Expenditure Account and the Balance Sheet from the Receipts and Payments Account after making adjustments in respect of Income accrued but not collected and expenses outstanding. The preparation of Balance Sheet in such a case is also necessary since an Income and Expenditure Account must always be accompanied by a Balance Sheet. The procedure which should be followed in this regard is briefly outlined below. i.Compute the opening balance of the Accumulated Fund, or Capital Fund of the Institution with the help of making opening balance sheet. It will be excess of the total value of the assets over that of the liabilities at the commencement of the period. ii.Open ledger accounts in respect of various items of income and expenditure (e.g. subscription, rents, printing, purchase of sports materials etc.) in which accruals or outstanding at the beginning or at the end of period have to be adjusted. Enter therein any accrual or outstanding at the end of the period as well as amounts which relate to an earlier period or the following period. The balance of the ledger accounts therefore will represent the amounts or income or expenditure pertaining to the period. These should be transferred to the Income and Expenditure Account.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 220}, page_content='iii.Post from the debit of the Receipts & Payments Account to the credit of the Income and Expenditure Account other items of income wherein accruals and outstanding amount have to be adjusted. Likewise, post item of expenses in which no adjustment is to be made directly to debit of income and Expenditure Account. iv.Transfer the balance of Income and Expenditure Account to the Accumulated Fund/Capital Fund Account. v.Post the receipts and payments of capital nature from the Receipts and Payments Account to the appropriate asset or liability account for incorporating in the Balance Sheet. If a part or whole of an asset has been sold, the capital profit/loss, if any, is credited / debited in the Income and Expenditure Account. The balance of Income and Expenditure Account should be transferred to the Accumulated Fund/Capital Fund Account. vi.Prepare a Balance Sheet by including therein all the balances left over after transfers to the Income and Expenditure Account have been made. 4.BALANCE SHEET A Balance Sheet is the statement of assets and liabilities of an accounting unit at a given date. It is generally prepared at the end of an accounting period after the Income and Expenditure Account has been prepared. It is classified summary of the ledger balances left over, after accounts of all the revenue items have been closed by transfer to the Income and Expenditure Account. In not for profit organizations, the excess of total assets over total outside liabilities is known as Capital Fund. The Capital fund represents the amount contributed by members, through legacies, special donations, entrance fees and accumulated surplus over the years. If however, members have not contributed any amount, it shall be termed as \"Accumulated fund\" instead of \"Capital fund\". The surplus or deficit, if any, on the year\\'s working as disclosed by the Income and Expenditure Account is shown either as an addition to or deduction from the Capital / Accumulated Fund brought forward from the previous period respectively. 4.1.Accounting Treatment of Some Special Items 4.1.1 Donations: These may have been raised either for meeting some revenue or capital expenditure; those intended for the first mentioned purpose are credited directly to the Income and Expenditure Account but others, if the donors have declared their specific intention, then they are credited to special fund account and in the absence thereof, to the Capital Fund Account. If any investments are purchased out of a special fund or an asset is acquired therefrom, these are disclosed separately. Any income received from such investments or any donations collected for a special purpose are credited to an account indicating the'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 221}, page_content='purpose and correspondingly the expenditure incurred in carrying out the purpose of the fund is debited to this account. On no account any such expense is charged to the Income and Expenditure Account. The term \"Fund\" is strictly applicable to the amounts collected for a special purpose when these are invested, e.g. Scholarship Fund, Prize Fund etc. In other cases, when the amounts collected are not invested in securities or assets distinguishable from those belonging to the institution, the word \"Account\" is more appropriate e.g. Building_Account, Tournament Account etc. Instead of paying cash, a donor may sometimes give away or transfer a security or some other readily realisable asset. In such a case, the value of asset on valuation, must be credited to the fund for which the amount has been donated. 4.1.2 Entrance and Admission Fees: Such fees which are payable by a member on admission to club or society are normally considered capital receipts and credited to Capital Fund. This is because these do not give rise to any special obligation towards the member who is entitled to the same privileges as others who have paid only their annual subscription. Nevertheless, where the amount is small, meant to cover expenses concerning admission, or the rules of the society provided that such fees could be treated as income of the society, these amounts may be included in the Income and Expenditure Account. The treatment depends upon the requirement of question. If the question is silent then always take it to be capital receipt. 4.1.3 Subscription: Subscriptions being an income should be allocated over the period of their accrual. For testing the knowledge of candidates of this important accounting principle, questions are often set in examinations wherein figures of subscription collected by a society during the year as well as those outstanding at the beginning of the year and at its close are given. If some subscriptions have been received in advance, their amount is also indicated. In such cases, it is always desirable to set up a Subscription Account for determining the amount of subscription pertaining for the period for which accounts are being prepared. For example, if it is stated that subscriptions collected by a society during the year 2022 amounted to ₹ 1,850 out of which ₹ 200 represented subscription for the year 2021 ; ₹ 100 were subscriptions collected in advance for the year 2023, and subscriptions amounting to ₹ 500 were outstanding for recovery at the end of 2022, the adjusting journal entries and the Subscription Account should be set up as follows: Subscription Outstanding Account: To Subscriptions Account Dr. ₹500 (The amount outstanding for this year credited to Subscription Account) Subscription A/c: To Outstanding Subscription A/c Dr. ₹300'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 222}, page_content='To Subscriptions Received in Advance A/c ₹200 (Subscription received ₹200 for the previous year and ₹100 for the next year, adjusted) Subscription Account: 2022 Dr. Jan 1 To Balance b/d (Outstanding Subscriptions) ₹200 Dec. 31 To Subscriptions received in advance ₹100 To Income and Expenditure Account ₹2,050 Total ₹2,350 2022 Cr. Dec. By Cash A/c ₹1,850 By Balance c/d (Subscriptions Outstanding) ₹500 Total ₹2,350 The amount of outstanding subscription is adjusted in the Subscription Account by debit to Outstanding Subscription Account and that balance is shown as an asset in Balance Sheet. The Subscription Account is closed off by transferring its balance at the end of the year to the Income and Expenditure Account. 4.1.4 Life Membership Fee: Fees received for life membership is a capital receipt as it is of non-recurring nature. It is directly added to capital fund or general fund. For adjusting lump sum subscription collected from the life members, one of the following methods can be adopted: 1)The entire amount may be carried forward in a special account until the member dies, after which the same may be transferred to the credit of the Accumulated Fund. 2)An amount equal to the normal annual subscription may be transferred every year to the Income and Expenditure Account and balance carried forward till it is exhausted. If, however, the life member dies before the whole of the amount paid by him has been transferred in this way, the balance should be transferred to the Accumulated Fund on the date of his death. 3)An amount, calculated according to the age and average life of the member, may annually be transferred to the credit of Income and Expenditure Account.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 223}, page_content='Other concepts Treatment of Important Items in Not For Profit Organization 1.Donation: it is gift in cash or kind from some person. It may be of two types: a.Specific Donation: It is received for certain specific purpose like Building Donation,   Library Books donation etc. It should be capitalized and shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. b.General Donation: It is not received for any specific purpose and shown on the credit side of Income and Expenditure Account. 2.Entrance Fees: It may also be known as admission fees. Entrance Fees should be capitalized and added to the capital fund for all organization. If the question gives any specific treatment of Entrance fees, then it should be followed accordingly. 3.Legacy: It is an amount received by an organization as per the will of the person after the death of the person. It should be capitalised and shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet by adding to the Capital Fund. 4.Life Membership Fees: It should be capitalized and shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. If the question gives any specific treatment of Life membership Fees, then it should be followed accordingly. 5.Endowment Fund Donation: It is a donation received and only income from that donation is to be used for certain specific purpose. In such cases income relating to special funds should be added to these funds on the liabilities side of the Balance Sheet. All the expenses should be deducted from that fund on the liabilities side of the Balance Sheet. 6.Treatment of Sale of Old Newspaper and Periodicals: The amount received on such sale is shown as Income on the credit side of income and expenditure account. 7.Sale of old Fixed Assets: The Sale proceeds of old Fixed Assets are treated as capital receipts. The profit or loss on sale of fixed asset is shown in the Income and Expenditure  8.Honorarium: It is paid to someone for receiving any services from person who are not the employees of the Not for Profit Organisation. 4.2.Preparation of Balance Sheet A/c'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 224}, page_content='•Preparation of opening balance sheet and calculation of surplus: If capital fund or accumulated surplus in the beginning of the year is not given, it is calculated by deducting liabilities from assets in the beginning of year. While calculating opening capital fund, care should be taken to include prepaid expenses and accrued incomes as assets and outstanding expenses and advance incomes as liabilities. Any surplus earned during the year is added to the opening capital fund and deficit suffered during the year is deducted from the opening capital fund. •Cash and bank balance: Closing cash and bank balance as disclosed in Receipt and Payment Account is shown in the assets side of Balance Sheet. If there is a bank overdraft, it is to be shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. •Fixed assets: Opening balances of Fixed Assets (Furniture, building, equipment, etc.) are increased by the amount of purchases and reduced by sales of the same and depreciation on the same. •Liabilities: Opening balances of liabilities should be adjusted for any increase or decrease in the same.

Therefore, Income & Expenditure Account and Balance Sheet are not prepared as per Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. 5.EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS Registration The educational institutions which are functioning in India are mostly registered as Societies under the Indian Societies Registration Act of 1860, in some of the States, where Public Trust Acts have been passed all the Societies registered under the Indian Societies Registration Act, 1860 are required to be simultaneously registered under the Trust Act. Accordingly, in the State of Maharashtra, all the Societies have simultaneously been registered under the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950. Organizational Pattern The Trust Societies are autonomous bodies with office bearers consisting of President, Secretary, Treasurer and Executive Committee Members. The General Body consists of all the Members of the Society. In case of Societies/Trusts which run a number of colleges and schools etc., for managing the affairs of each individual school or college, there is a governing body, wherein the head of the Unit, such as Principal of the college or Head Master of the school as, the case may be, are also members of the Governing Body.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 225}, page_content=\"The function of the Governing Body is to supervise the smooth functioning of the individual school or college. Salient Features The basic tenets pre-suppose, that part of the expenses of the educational institutions are met from the funds raised by the educational institutions themselves, either from donations, or from charities, collected from benevolent citizens in the country. The State Governments through grant-in-aid-code have evolved different patterns of giving assistance to the educational institutions. There is, as such, no uniformity in the giving of assistance to the educational institutions in the form of grants. All the educational institutions follow financial year as their accounting year. 5.1 Sources of Finance for Running the Educational Institution There are three main sources through which amounts are collected by the educational institutions. These are: 1)Donation from Public; 2)Fees in the form of annual tuition fees, term fees, admission fees, laboratory fee etc., and 3)Grants received from the Government. The Government grants are of four kinds namely Maintenance Grant, Equipment grant, Building Grant and such other grants as may be sanctioned by the Government from time to time. 5.2 Specific items 5.2.1 Donation from Public These are received either for recurring or non-recurring purposes. Donations are received either in cash or in kind. The 'in kind' donations are in the form of land and building, shares and securities, utensils, furniture and fixtures and the like, generally with a desire to perpetuate the memory of a distinguished member of the family of the donor. 5.2.2 Capitation fees or admission fees Amounts are collected from parents/guardians of the students who seek admission in the educational institution. These are either in the form of capitation fees or admission fees and are generally collected by the Parent Body\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 226}, page_content='which runs the institution. In recent times, such collections have been a matter of severe attack and ban. 5.2.3 Laboratory and Library deposit These are generally collected by schools and colleges and they remain with the institution till the student finally leaves it. The School Code prescribes the rates of tuition and other fees, to be charged from the students. 5.2.4 Use of Term Fees A separate account of receipts and expenditures shall be maintained and surplus carried over to the next year. The following are main items on which term fee can be used: 1.Medical Inspection. 2.School Magazine-manuscript and/or printing. 3.Examination expenses i.e. printing, of question papers and supply of answer books if there is sufficient balance. 4.Contribution to athletic and cultural associations, connected with school activities. 5.School functions and festivals. 6.Inter-class and Inter-school tournaments. 7.Sports and Games-major and minor. 8.Newspapers and magazines. 9.Extra-curricular excursion and visits. 10.School competition such as elocution competition etc. 11.Scouting and Guiding. 12.School Band. 13.Social and Cultural activities and equipment required for the same. 14.Vocational Guidance in general. 15.Prizes for Co-curricular activities.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 227}, page_content='16.Any other extra-curricular or co-curricular activities. 17.Maintenance of playground. 18.Purchase of books for Pupils Library. 19.Drawing and Craft material. 20.Audio-Visual Education. 21.Curricular visits and excursions. 22.Equipment for Physical education. 5.2.5 Recurring grants Recurring grants in the form of Maintenance Grants are received in instalments spread out throughout the year. 5.2.6 Use of grant-in-aid The School Code provides a detailed list of items of expenditure which are admissible for grant-in-aid: 1)Staff salaries and allowances 2)Leave Allowance. 3)Bad Climate Allowance. 4)Water Allowance. 5)Leave Salary. 6)Expenditure on training of teachers. 7)Pension and Gratuity as may be applicable. 8)Expenditure on the appointment of Librarian. 9)Rent, Taxes and Insurance. 10)Other Contingencies: expenditure of printing and stationery, conveyance expenditure, expenditure on purchase of books and furniture equipment. 11)Current repairs. 12)Miscellaneous Expenses: e.g. School Garden, Physical Education. 13)Prizes.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 228}, page_content='14)Expenditure on co-operative stores. 15)Registration fee paid to the Board for recognition. 16)Maintenance of Tiffin Rooms. 17)Bonus to Teachers. 18)Electrical charges. 19)Telephone Charges. 20)Expenditure in connection with Conferences. 21)Subscription to educational Association etc. 22)Medical charges. 23)Audit fees of the auditors in accordance with prescribed scale. 24)Sales-tax and General tax on purchase of the school requirements. 25)Payments for merit scholarships.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 229}, page_content='CHAPTER 9 ACCOUNTS FROM INCOMPLETE RECORDS 1.INTRODUCTION Very often small sole proprietorship and partnership businesses do not maintain double entry book keeping. There might be reasons like lack of knowledge of accounting, or the business is small and they do not wish to spend time or effort in maintaining the accounting records. As such, they might keep a record of the cash transactions and credit transactions only. But at the end of the accounting period, they will want to know the performance and financial position of their businesses. Think of a grocery-vendor who sells vegetables on a street or runs a small shop. Is he expected to learn accounting formally? No, he is only looking at keeping a record of a few items including: •What amount is he supposed to pay for items purchased on credit from his supplier? •What cash has he collected by selling those vegetables? •In case he runs a shop, how much amount has he paid for rent or electricity expenses? •In case he sells some items on credit, how much is he supposed to receive from that customer? There might be other reasons for incomplete records such as: • Accounting records are destroyed by accident, such as fire; •Some essential figure is unknown and must be calculated as a balancing figure (for example, due to inventory being damaged or destroyed).'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 230}, page_content='Every person would like to know the profit generated by the business. What we expect to learn is how to use those records to arrive at the profit or loss earned by the business or understand the financial position of that business. This chapter discusses how to complete the accounts from available incomplete records and addresses the problems faced in a single-entry system. There is no such formal system as Single-Entry System as the accounts can only be prepared using Double Entry System. It might be appropriate to mention that a single-entry system is truly a system of incomplete or improper records. The way \"Single Entry System\" operates is that for some transactions the book-keepers complete entries and for some others they complete just one aspect of the transaction. In fact, for some other transactions, they even do not pass any entry. The task of the accountant is to establish link among the available information and to finalize these accounts. Normally, the businessmen keep a record of cash receipts and cash payments and personal accounts (receivables, payables, capital etc.) Also, information from bank statement (withdrawals, deposits) is easily available as well. Features of Single Entry System •It is an inaccurate, unscientific and unsystematic method of recording business transactions. •There is generally no record of real and nominal accounts and, in most of the cases; a record is kept for cash transactions and personal accounts. •Cash book mixes up business and personal transactions of the owners. • There is no uniformity in maintaining the records and the system may differ from firm to firm depending on the requirements and convenience of each firm. • Profit under this system is only an estimate based on available information and therefore true and correct profits cannot be determined. The same is the case with the financial position in the absence of a proper balance sheet. 2.TYPES OF SINGLE ENTRY SYSTEM A scrutiny of many procedures adopted in maintaining records under single entry system brings forth the existence of following three types: i.Pure single entry: In this, only personal accounts are maintained with the result that no information is available in respect of cash and bank'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 231}, page_content='balances, sales and purchases, etc. In view of its failure to provide even the basic information regarding cash etc., this method exists only on paper and has no practical application. ii.Simple single entry: In this, only: (a) personal accounts, and (b) cash book are maintained. Although these accounts are kept on the basis of double entry system, postings from cash book are made only to personal accounts with no other account to be found in the ledger. Cash received from debtors or cash paid to creditors is simply noted on the bills issued or received as the case may be. ACCOUNTS FROM INCOMPLETE RECORDS For example, M/s Small shop runs a retail shop. It keeps a register of amount receivable from people for items sold (bread, butter, milk etc). as under: Mr. A - ₹ 300 Mr. B - ₹ 450 Mr. C - ₹ 260. The business does not maintain a record of what item has been sold. It is only concerned about the amount receivable (personal account balance) from its customers. Quasi single entry: In this: (a) personal accounts, (b) cash book, and (c) some subsidiary books are maintained. The main subsidiary books kept under this system are Sales book, Purchases book and Bills book. No separate record is maintained for discounts, which are entered into the personal accounts. In addition, some scattered information is also available in respect of few important items of expenses like wages, rent, rates, etc. In fact, this is the method which is generally adopted as a substitute for double entry system. Some businesses may also maintain additional records like Bills book or Sales book. This might be required for tax or other purposes. For example, a shop selling -shirts may want to issue a bill to each customer for the sales made to them. This will help them validate any returns of goods within reasonable time. In addition, they may keep a purchase book to record all purchases. Also, organisations employing workers keep records of cash wages paid and take acceptance from the workers for the amount paid to them. Types of Single Entry System t'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 232}, page_content=\"In accounting, the single entry system is a method where only one entry is made for each transaction, and it is categorized into different types based on the records maintained: 1.Pure Single Entry: In this most basic form, only personal accounts are maintained. It involves recording the transaction involving individuals and entities, excluding the records of assets, liabilities, incomes, and expenses. 2.Simple Single Entry: This system is a step above the pure single entry system, where personal accounts and a cash book are maintained. The cash book records all cash transactions, providing some information about cash flows, in addition to the records of individuals and businesses the entity deals with. 3.Quasi Single Entry: This system is a hybrid approach that includes the maintenance of personal accounts, a cash book, and subsidiary books. Subsidiary books may include records such as purchases and sales books, which allows for a more comprehensive tracking of transactions than the pure or simple single entry systems. Each type of single entry system serves a different level of accounting needs, with increasing complexity and detail in the records maintained. 3.ASCERTAINMENT OF PROFIT BY CAPITAL COMPARISON This method is also known as Net Worth method or Statement of Affairs Method. Net Worth Method or Statement of Affairs Method The Net Worth method, also known as the Statement of Affairs Method, is a technique used to estimate the profit or loss of a business over a certain period of time. This approach is particularly useful in single-entry accounting systems where a full double-entry bookkeeping record is not available. The formula to calculate profit or loss is: Profit/(Loss) = Closing Capital - Opening Capital Where: Closing Capital refers to the net worth of the business at the end of the accounting period, as determined by the Statement of Affairs. It is the total assets minus total liabilities at the period's end. Opening Capital is the net worth of the business at the beginning of the accounting period, also determined by the Statement of Affairs, which is the total assets minus total liabilities at the period's start.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 233}, page_content=\"The difference between the closing capital and the opening capital represents the net increase or decrease in the owner's equity, which, after adjusting for any drawings and additional capital introduced during the period, gives the profit or loss. If detailed information regarding revenue and expenses is not known, it becomes difficult to prepare profit and loss account. Instead by collecting information about assets and liabilities, it is easier to prepare balance sheet at two different points of time. So, while preparing accounts from incomplete records, if sufficient information is not available, it is better to follow the method of capital comparison to arrive at the profit/loss for the current year. 3.1 Methods of Capital Comparison Closing capital increases if there is profit, while it reduces if there is loss incurred during the year. However, if the proprietor/partners make fresh investments in the business, capital increases; and any withdrawal made by them, decreases the capital. The following points shall be considered while computing the profit/loss under capital comparison method- Particulars  Capital at the end (a)  Add: Drawings  Less: Fresh capital introduced  Capital at the beginning (b)  Profit (a-b)  3.2 Difference between Statement of Affairs and Balance Sheet Basis of Comparison: 1.Source: Statement of Affairs: It is prepared on the basis of partially recorded transactions under the double entry system and estimates under the single entry system, with much of the information gathered from memory rather than complete records. Balance Sheet: It is strictly based on double-entry bookkeeping with each item verifiable from subsidiary books, ledger accounts, and documentary evidence. 2.Capital: Statement of Affairs: Here, capital is merely a balancing figure, reflecting the excess of assets over liabilities. Balance Sheet: Capital is derived from the capital account in the ledger, ensuring assets are equal to liabilities.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 234}, page_content='3.Omission: Statement of Affairs: Incomplete records make it difficult to identify and record all assets and liabilities, leading to potential omissions. Balance Sheet: There is no possibility of omission as all assets and liabilities are properly recorded, and the balance must agree. 4.Basis of Valuation: Statement of Affairs: Valuation is often arbitrary and not based on a systematic method, and the method of valuation is not usually disclosed. Balance Sheet: Assets are valued on a scientific basis, and any changes in valuation method are clearly disclosed. 5.Objective: Statement of Affairs: The objective is to identify the commencement of trading, by preparing a statement that figures the beginning and end capital accounts in the respective accounting periods. Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is prepared to ascertain the financial position on a particular date, ensuring accurate and timely financial reporting. 3.3 Preparation of Statement of Affairs and Determination of Profit It has been discussed in Para 3.1 that figures of assets and liabilities should be collected for preparation of statement of affairs. Given below an example: 4.TECHNIQUES OF OBTAINING COMPLETE ACCOUNTING INFORMATION When books of accounts are incomplete, it is essential to complete double entry in respect of all transactions. The whole accounting process should be carefully followed and Trial Balance should be drawn up. 4.1 General Techniques Where the accounts of a business are incomplete, it is advisable to convert them first to the double entry system and then to draw up the Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet, instead of determining the amount of profit/loss by preparing the statement of affairs. As books of accounts of different firms being incomplete in varying degrees, it is not possible to suggest a formula which could uniformly be applied for preparing final accounts therefrom. As a general rule, it is essential to first start the ledger accounts with the opening balances of assets, liabilities and the capital. Afterwards, each book of original entry should be separately dealt with, so as to complete the double entry by posting into the ledger all entries which have not been posted. For example, If only personal accounts have been posted from the Cash Book, debits and credits pertaining to nominal accounts and real accounts that are not posted, should be posted into the'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 235}, page_content=\"ledger. If there are Discount Columns in the Cash Book, the totals of discounts paid and received should be posted to Discounts Allowed and Discounts Received Accounts respectively, for completing the double entry. Afterwards, the other subsidiary books, i.e., Purchases Day Book, Sales Day Book, Purchase Return Book, Sales Return Book, Bills Receivable and Bills Payable, etc. should be totaled up and their totals posted into the ledger to the debit or credit of the appropriate nominal or real accounts, as the personal aspect of the transactions have been posted already. When an Accountant is engaged in posting the unposted items from the Cash Book and other subsidiary books, he may be confronted with a number of problems. The manner in which some of them may be dealt with is described below: 1)In the Cash Book, there can be several receipt entries which have no connection with the business but which belong to the proprietor, e.g., interest collected on his private investment, legacies received by him, amount contributed by the proprietor from his private resources, etc. All those amounts should be credited to his capital account. Also the Cash Book may contain entries in respect of payments for proprietor's purchases and his personal expenses. All such items should be taken to his capital account on the debit side as drawings. 2)Amounts belonging to the business after collection may have been directly utilised for acquiring business assets or for meeting certain expenses instead of being recorded in the Cash Book. On the other hand, the proprietor may have met some of the business expenses from his private resources. In that case, the appropriate asset or expense account should be debited and the source of obtaining funds to be credited. 3)If cash is short, because the proprietor had withdrawn amount without any entry having been made in the cash book the proprietor’s capital account should be debited. In fact, it will be necessary to credit or debit the proprietor’s capital amount which cannot be adjusted anywhere else. 4)Where the benefit of an item of an expense is received both by the proprietor and business, then it should be allocated between the two on some equitable basis e.g. rent of premises when the proprietor lives in the same premises, should be allocated on the basis of the area occupied by him for residence. In the end, it will be possible to draw a Trial Balance. Students are advised to prepare a Trial balance as it will bring out any mistakes committed while making the above adjustments. 4.2 Derivation of Information from Cash Book\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 236}, page_content='The analysis of cash as well as bank receipts and payments, should be extensive but under significant heads, so that various items of income and expenditure can be posted therefrom into the ledger. However before posting the information into the ledger the same should be collected in the form of an account, the specimen whereof is shown below: Cash and Bank Summary Account for the year ended (assumed figures) Cash and Bank Summary Account for the year ended (assumed figures): To Balance in hand: Cash ₹590, Bank ₹7,400 By Expenses: Cash ₹3,000 Accounting 9.16: To Sales: ₹6,500 To Collection from Debtors: ₹10,000 By Purchases: Cash ₹100, Bank ₹6,000 By Sundry creditors: Bank ₹5,000 By Drawings: Cash ₹1,500 By Petty expenses: Cash ₹800 By Rent: Bank ₹1,000 By Electricity and water: Bank ₹350 By Repairs: Bank ₹350 By Wages: Bank ₹1,000 By Balance in Hand: Cash ₹990, Bank ₹4,400 The important point about incomplete records is that much of the information may not be readily available and that the relevant information has to be ascertained. A good point is to prepare Cash and Bank Summary (if not available in proper form with both sides tallied). The cash and bank balance at the end should be reconciled with the cash and bank books. Having done so, the various items detailed on the Summary Statements, should be posted into the ledger. It is quite likely that some of the missing information will then be available. Consider the following about a firm relating to  March 2022. Cash and Bank Summary: 31st'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 237}, page_content='Dr. Cash Balance on 1-4-2021: ₹250 Collection from Sundry debtors: ₹45,600 Sale of old furniture: ₹750 Fresh Capital brought in: ₹5,000 Balancing figure- (Cash sales): ₹8,340 Cash Balance on 31-03-2022: ₹310 Cr.

What may be the possible source of cash inflow? It can be cash sales. 4.3 Analysis of Sales Ledger and Purchase Ledger Sales Ledger: It would disclose information pertaining to the opening balances of debtors, transactions made with them during the year such as goods sold to them on credit, bills receivable drawn on them, bills dishonored, if any; cash received from them, sales returns, discount, rebate or any other concession allowed to them, receipts of bills receivable, bad debts written off and transfers. Journal entries must be made by debiting or crediting the impersonal accounts concerned with contra credit or debit given to total debtors account.

It can be opening balance, credit sales, cash collected or closing balance etc. For instance, if the information about sales is not available it could be ascertained as the balancing figure, i.e., in the total Debtors Account given above, if all other figures are given, amount of sales on credit basis can be easily ascertained.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 239}, page_content=\"4.4 Distinction between Business Expenses and Drawings It has been already stated that often the distinction is not made between business expenses and drawings. While completing accounts from incomplete records, it is necessary to scan the business transactions carefully to identify the existence of drawings. The main items of drawings are (illustrative): • Rent of premises commonly used for residential as well as business purposes. •Common electricity and telephone bills. •Life insurance premiums of proprietor/partners paid from business cash. •Household expenses met from business cash. • Private loan paid to friends and relatives out of business cash. • Personal gifts made to any friends and relatives out of business cash. •Goods or services taken from the business for personal consumption. •Cash withdrawals to meet family expenses. •Amount collected from debtors directly used for meeting personal expenses. So it is necessary to scan the summary of cash transactions, business resources and their utilization to assess the nature of drawings and its amount. 4.5 Fresh Investment by proprietors / partners Like drawings, often fresh investments made by proprietors'/partners are not readily identifiable. It becomes necessary to scan the business transactions carefully. Apart from direct cash investment, fresh investments may take the following shape: •Money collected and put in the business on maturity of Life Insurance Policy of the proprietors. •Interest and dividend of personal investment of the proprietors collected and put in the business. •Income from non-business property collected and put in the business.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 240}, page_content='• Payments made to creditors out of personal cash.

An individual, i.e., a sole proprietor may not be in a position to cope with the financial and managerial demands of the present-day business world. As a result, two or more individuals may decide to pool their financial and non-financial resources to carry on a business. The preparation of final accounts of sole proprietors have already been discussed in chapter 6 . The final accounts of partnership firms including basic concepts of accounting for admission of a partner, retirement and death of a partner have been discussed in succeeding units of this chapter. 2.DEFINITION AND FEATURES OF PARTNERSHIP'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 241}, page_content='As per Section 4 of the Partnership Act, 1932: \"Partnership is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profit of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all.\" Features of a partnership, i.Existence of an agreement: As per section 5 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, The relation of partnership arises from contract between parties and not from status as it happens in case of HUF (Hindu Undivided Family). A formal or written agreement is not necessary to create a partnership. ii.Business: A partnership can exist only in business. Thus, it is not the agreement alone which creates a partnership. A partnership comes into existence only when partners begin to carry on business in accordance with their agreement. Section 2 (b) of Indian Partnership Act, 1932 only states that business includes every trade, occupation and profession. iii.Sharing of profit: The persons concerned must agree to share the profits of the business. Because no person is a partner unless he or she has the right to share the profits of the business. Section 4 of Indian Partnership Act, 1932 does not insist upon sharing of losses. Thus, a provision for sharing of loss is not necessary. iv.Mutual agency: It means that the business is to be carried on by all or any of them acting for all. Thus, if the person carrying on the business acts not only for himself but for others also so that they stand in the positions of principals and agents, they are partners. v.Minor as a partner: A minor can be added in partnership firm. But the condition is that he can be admitted to share profit only. He cannot be made to share losses of the firm. If the partnership firm suffers loss than it will be borne by other major partners is their profit-sharing ratio. Number of Partners: Minimum Partners: Two Maximum Partners: As per Section 464 of the Companies Act, 2013, no association or partnership consisting of more than 100 number of persons as may be prescribed shall be formed for the purpose of carrying on any business. Rule 10 of Companies (incorporation) Rules 2014 specifies the limit as 50. Thus, maximum number of members in a partnership firm are 50. 3.LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 242}, page_content=\"The Indian Partnership Act of 1932 provides for a general form of partnership which has inherent shortcoming of unlimited liability of all partners for business debts and legal consequences, regardless of their holding or profit-sharing ratio, as the firm is not a legal entity. General partners are also jointly and severally liable for tortuous acts of co-partners. In case of liquidation personal assets of partners can be liquidated to meet liabilities of the firm. With the growth of the Indian economy, the role played by its entrepreneurs as well as its technical and professional manpower has been acknowledged internationally. Entrepreneurship, knowledge, risk and capital may be combined to provide a further impetus to India's economic growth. In this background, a need has been felt for a new corporate form that would provide an alternative to the traditional partnership, with unlimited personal liability on the one hand, and, the statute-based governance structure of the limited liability company on the other. This would enable professional expertise and entrepreneurial initiative to combine, organize and operate in flexible, innovative and efficient manner. The Government felt that with Indian professionals increasingly transacting with or representing multi-nationals in international transactions, the extent of the liability they could potentially be exposed to, is extremely high. Hence, in order to encourage Indian professionals to participate in the international business community without apprehension of being subject to excessive liability, the need for having a legal structure like the LLP is encouraged. Thus, in convergence towards global scenario, Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 was introduced. The Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is viewed as an alternative corporate business proposal that provides the benefits of limited liability but allows its members, the flexibility of organizing their internal structure as a partnership, which is based on a mutually arrived agreement. The LLP will be a separate legal entity, liable to the full extent of its assets, with the liability of the partners being limited to their agreed contribution in the LLP which may be of tangible or intangible nature or both tangible and intangible in nature. No partner would be liable on account of the independent or un-authorized actions of other partners or their misconduct. The liabilities of the LLP and partners who are found to have acted with intent to defraud Creditors or for any fraudulent purpose shall be unlimited for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the LLP. The main benefit in an LLP is that it is taxed as a partnership, but has the benefits of being a corporate, or more significantly, a juristic entity with limited liability. An LLP has the special characteristic of being a separate legal personality distinct from its partners. The LLP is a body corporate in nature.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 243}, page_content='Summary of key advantages and challenges associated with formation of LLP could be presented as below: Advantages: i.LLP is organized and operates on the basis of an agreement. ii.Enables professional/technical expertise and initiative to combine with financial risk taking capacity in an innovative and efficient manner. iii.Limited liability of partners as in case of corporate entities along with flexibility of a partnership without imposing detailed legal and procedural requirements; iv.Lower registration costs as compared to corporate entities; v.Audit not mandatory (subject to turnover / capital contribution benchmark) Challenges: i.Public disclosure of financial statements; ii.No option for Equity investments; iii.Extensive penal provisions for non-compliance The Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) in India were introduced by Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 which lay down the law for the formation and regulation of Limited Liability Partnerships. Later, the Ministry of Law and Justice made amendments to the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 (LLP Act) through the LLP (Amendment) Act, 2021. 1.3.1 Definition of LLP Section 2 of the Limited Liability Partnership (LLPs) Act, 2008 defines limited liability partnership\" as a partnership formed and registered under this Act; and \"limited liability partnership agreement\" means any written agreement between the partners of the limited liability partnership or between the limited liability partnership and its partners which determines the mutual rights and duties of the partners and their rights and duties in relation to that limited liability partnership. \"Small limited liability partnership\" means a limited liability partnership—'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 244}, page_content='i.the contribution of which, does not exceed twenty-five lakh rupees or such higher amount, not exceeding five crore rupees, as may be prescribed; and ii.the turnover of which, as per the Statement of Accounts and Solvency for the immediately preceding financial year, does not exceed forty lakh rupees or such higher amount, not exceeding fifty crore rupees, as may be prescribed; or 1.3.2 Nature of Limited Liability Partnership 1)A limited liability partnership is a body corporate formed and incorporated under this Act and is a legal entity separate from that of its partners. 2)A limited liability partnership should have perpetual succession. 3)Any change in the partners of a limited liability partnership should not affect the existence, rights, or liabilities of the limited liability partnership. 1.3.3 Non-applicability of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 Save as otherwise provided, the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 shall not apply to a limited liability partnership. 1.3.4 Minimum number of partners in case of LLP As per the LLP Act, any individual or body corporate may be a partner in a limited liability partnership; provided that an individual shall not be capable of becoming a partner of a limited liability partnership, if- a)he has been found to be of unsound mind by a Court of competent jurisdiction and the finding is in force; b)he is an undischarged insolvent; or c)he has applied to be adjudicated as an insolvent and his application is pending. Every limited liability partnership shall have at least two partners. If at any time the number of partners of a limited liability partnership is reduced below two and the limited liability partnership carries on business for more than six months while the number is so reduced, the person, who is the only partner of the limited liability partnership during the time that it so carries on business after those six months and has the knowledge of the fact that it is carrying on business with him alone, shall be liable personally for the obligations of the limited liability partnership incurred during that period.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 245}, page_content='1.3.5 Designated partners As per Section 7 of the LLP Act, every limited liability partnership should have at least two designated partners who are individuals and at least one of them should be a resident in India: Provided that in case of a limited liability partnership in which all the partners are bodies corporate or in which one or more partners are individuals and bodies corporate, at least two individuals who are partners of such limited liability partnership or nominees of such body corporate will act as designated partners.

In contrast, a Partnership firm is not a body corporate and does not have a separate legal entity from its partners. 3.Separate Legal Entity: LLP is a separate legal entity, whereas a Partnership firm is a group of persons with no separate legal entity. 4.Creation: LLP is created through a legal registration process under the LLP Act, 2008. A Partnership firm is created by an agreement between the partners. 5.Registration: Registration is mandatory for LLPs, and they can sue or be sued in their own name. For Partnership firms, registration is voluntary. 6.Perpetual Succession: LLPs have perpetual succession; the change in members does not affect its existence. Partnership firms do not have perpetual succession; changes in partners may affect the firm\\'s existence. 7.Name: The name of an LLP must contain \"limited liability partnership\" or \"LLP\" as a suffix. Partnership firms have no specific naming guidelines. 8.Liability: In an LLP, each partner\\'s liability is limited to their contribution except in cases of willful fraud. In a Partnership firm, each partner\\'s liability can be extended up to their personal assets. 9.Mutual Agency: In an LLP, each partner can bind the LLP by their actions but not the other partners. In a Partnership firm, each partner can bind the firm and the other partners by their actions. 10.Designated Partners: LLPs must have at least two designated partners, one of whom must be a resident in India. Partnership firms do not have provisions for designated partners.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 248}, page_content='11.Number of Partners: LLPs require a minimum of two partners but have no maximum limit. Partnership firms also require a minimum of two partners but have a maximum of fifty. 12.Legal Compliances: In LLPs, only designated partners are responsible for legal compliances and penalties under the Act. In Partnership firms, all partners share this responsibility. 13.Foreign Partnership: LLPs allow foreign nationals to become partners in an LLP. Partnership firms do not permit foreign nationals to become partners. 14.Minor as Partner: A minor cannot be admitted to the benefits of an LLP, whereas a minor can be admitted to the benefits of a partnership with the consent of the existing partners. 5.MAIN CLAUSES IN A PARTNERSHIP DEED The relation between the partners is governed by mutual agreement known as partnership deed. It should be comprehensive to avoid disputes later on. It is usual therefore, to find the following clauses in a Partnership Deed which may or may not be registered. 1.Name of the firm and the partners; 2.Commencement and duration of business; 3.Amount of capital to be contributed by each partner; 4.Amount to be allowed to each partner as drawings and the timings of such drawings; 5.Rate of interest to be allowed to each partner on his capital and on his loan to the firm, and to be charged on his drawings; 6.The ratio in which profits or losses are to be shared; 7.Whether a partner will be allowed to draw any salary; 8.Any variations in the mutual rights and duties of partners; 9.Method of valuing goodwill on the occasions of changes in the constitution of the firm; 10.Procedure by which a partner may retire and the method of payment of his dues; 11.Basis of the determination of the executors of a deceased partner and the method of payment;'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 249}, page_content=\"12.Treatment of losses arising out of the insolvency of a partner; 13.Procedure to be allowed for settlement of disputes among partners; 14.Preparation of accounts and their audit. Registration of the firm is not compulsory, but non-registration restricts the partners or the firm from taking any legal action. Often there is no written Partnership Deed or, if there is one, it may be silent on a particular point. In that case the relevant sections of the Partnership Act will apply. If on any point the Partnership Deed contains a clause, it will hold good; otherwise the provisions of the Act relating to the questions will apply. Rules in the absence of Partnership Deed In the absence of any agreement to the contrary; Typical Stipulations in a Partnership Agreement A partnership agreement often includes specific provisions related to the financial arrangements among partners. Some standard clauses are: Salary: No partner is entitled to a salary for their involvement in the partnership's operations, as their compensation is typically derived from the profits earned by the firm. Interest on Capital: Partners are not to receive interest on the capital they have invested in the partnership. The capital contribution is considered a part of the ownership stake and not a loan that accrues interest. Interest on Drawings: No interest is charged on the amounts that partners withdraw from the business for personal use. These drawings are typically deducted from the partner's capital account or their share of the profits. Interest on Partner's Loan: If a partner extends a loan to the firm beyond their capital contribution, they are entitled to interest at a predetermined rate, often cited as 6% per annum in the agreement. Sharing of Profits and Losses: Profits and losses resulting from the partnership's activities are to be divided equally among partners, regardless of their individual capital contributions or efforts, unless otherwise agreed upon. These clauses are designed to ensure a clear understanding of the financial rights and obligations of each partner within the partnership structure. Note: In the absence of an agreement, the interest and salary payable to a partner will be paid only if there is profit. 6.POWERS OF PARTNERS\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 250}, page_content=\"The Partners are supposed to have the power to act in certain matters and not to have such powers in others. In other words, unless a public notice has been given to the contrary, certain contracts entered into by a partner on behalf of the partnership, even without consulting other partners are binding on the firm and the provisions of the Act relating to the question will apply. In case of a trading firm, the implied powers of partners are the following: a)Buying and selling of goods; b)Receiving payments on behalf of the firm and giving valid receipt; c)Drawing cheques and drawing, accepting and endorsing bills of exchange and promissory notes in the name of the firm;  d)Borrowing money on behalf of the firm with or without pledging the inventories-intrade; e)Engaging servants for the business of the firm. In certain cases an individual partner has no power to bind the firm. This is to say that third parties cannot bind the firm unless all the partners have agreed. These cases are: a.Submitting a dispute relating to the firm arbitration; b.Opening a bank account on behalf of the firm in the name of a partner; c.Compromise or relinquishment of any claim or portion of claim by the firm; d.Withdrawal of a suit or proceeding filed on behalf of the firm; e.Admission of any liability in a suit or proceedings against the firm; f.Acquisition of immovable property belonging to the firm; g.Entering into partnership on behalf of the firm. The rights, duties and powers of partners can be changed by mutual consent. 7.ACCOUNTS Partnership Act doesn't specify any format for preparation of accounts of Partnership Firm and thus accounts are prepared as per Basic rules of accounts. There is not much difference between the accounts of a partnership firm and that of sole proprietorship (provided there is no change in the firm itself). The only difference to be noted is that instead of one Capital Account there will be as many Capital Accounts as there are partners. If, for instance, there are three partners;\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 251}, page_content=\"A, B, and C, then there will be a Capital Account for each one of the partners; A's Capital Account will be credited by the amount contributed by him as capital and similarly B's and C's Capital Accounts will be credited with the amounts brought in by them respectively as capital. When a partner takes money out of the firms for his domestic purpose, either his Capital Account can be debited or a separate account, named as Drawings Account, can be opened in his name and the account may be debited. In a Trial Balance of a partnership firm, therefore, one may find Capital Accounts of partners as well as Drawings Accounts. Finally the Drawings Account of a partner may be transferred to his Capital Account so that a net figure is available. But, often the Drawings Account or Current Account (as it is usually called) remains separate. 8.PROFIT AND LOSS APPROPRIATION During the course of business, a partnership firm will prepare Trading Account and a Profit and Loss Account at the end of every year. The final accounts of a sole proprietorship concern will not differ from the accounts of a partnership firm. The Profit and Loss Account will show the profit earned by the firm or loss suffered by it. This profit or loss has to be transferred to the Capital Accounts of partners according to the terms of the Partnership Deed or according to the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act (if there is no Partnership Deed or if the Deed is silent on a particular point). Suppose the Profit and Loss Account reveals a profit of ₹ 90,000. There are two partners, A and B. A devotes all his time to the firm; B does not. A's capital is ₹ 50,000 and  's is . There is no Partnership Deed. In such a case the profit will be distributed among  a n d   equally. This is irrespective of the fact that  does not work as much as A does and B's capital is much less than that of A. But if the Partnership Deed lays down that  is to get a salary and interest is to be allowed on the capital, then first of all, from the profit earned, A's salary must be deducted and interest on the Capital Accounts of both partners will be deducted. The remaining profit will be divided equally between  a n d  . Further if the Partnership Deed says that profits are to be divided in the ratio of, say, threefourth to  and one-fourth to , then this will be the ratio to be adopted. In a partnership, profit has to be divided between the partners in a certain profit sharing ratio after making necessary adjustments stated in the partnership deed such as interest on capitals, drawings and loans; salaries or/and commission to partners etc. Accordingly, an additional account is prepared and net profit is transferred from the debit side of the profit and loss account to the credit side of this new account which is called Profit and Loss Appropriation Account and before the profit is divided between partners, it is necessary to record the above stated adjustments in this account. B′ ₹20,000ABBAABAB\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 252}, page_content=\"The student can see for himself that if salary is to be allowed to a partner, the Profit and Loss Appropriation Account will be debited and the Partner's Capital Account will be credited. Similarly, if interest is to be allowed on capital, the Profit and Loss Appropriation Account will be debited and the respective Capital Accounts will be credited. Let us take an illustration to understand how to divide profits among partners. 9.FIXED AND FLUCTUATING CAPITAL You have seen in the above example that the Capital Account of A has changed from ₹ 30,000 at the beginning to ₹ 33,800 and B's Capital A/c from ₹ 20,000 to ₹ 23,200. This is because we have made entries in respect of interest, salary, profit earned during the year and money taken out by the partners in the Capital Account itself. If the Capital Accounts are prepared on this basis, capitals are said to be fluctuating. Some firms, however, prefer to continue to show the Capital Accounts of the partners at the same old figure. This means that no entry is to be made in the Capital Account in respect of interest, salary, profit and drawings etc. A separate account is to be opened for this purpose. This account is known as the Current Account or even as Drawings Account. Under this system interest on capital if allowed, should be calculated only on the amount of the fixed capital. If the capital Accounts are prepared on this basis, capitals are said to be fixed. Thus, there are two methods of accounting - i.Fixed capital method and ii.Fluctuating capital method. In Fixed capital method, generally initial capital contributions by the partners are credited to partners' capital accounts and all subsequent transactions and events are dealt with through current accounts, Unless a decision is taken to change it, initial capital account balance is not changed. In Fluctuating capital method, no current account is maintained. All such transactions and events are passed through capital accounts. Naturally, capital account balance of the partners fluctuates every time. So in fixed capital method a fixed capital balance is maintained over a period of time while in fluctuating capital method capital account balances fluctuate all the time. 1.9.1 Interest on Capital: A partner is not entitled to interest on his capital as a matter of right. But if there is an agreement, that partner would receive interest on his capital it is paid at the agreed rate only out of profits. Interest on capital is generally calculated on the\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 253}, page_content=\"opening balance and allowance is made for any additions of capital or withdrawals there from during the accounting period. •The amount of interest is debited to interest on capital accounts and credited to the capital accounts, if capitals are fluctuating and current accounts, if capitals are fixed. Interest on capital account is then closed by transfer to profit and loss appropriation account. •Alternatively, credit the capital (or current) account of the partner concerned and debit the profit and loss appropriation account. For interest on capital Profit and Loss Appropriation Account Dr. To (Individual) Capital (or Current) Accounts of Partners Interest is generally allowed on capitals of the partners. Interest on capital of partners is calculated for the relevant period for which the amount of capital has been used in the business. Normally, it is charged for full year on the balance of capital at the beginning of the year unless some fresh capital is introduced during the year. On the additional capital introduced, interest for the relevant period of utilization is calculated. For example, A has  capital in the beginning of the year and introduces ₹10,000 during the year. If rate of interest on capital is  p.a., interest on A's capital is calculated as follows:  In case of fixed capital accounts, interest is calculated on the balance of capital accounts only and no interest is payable / chargeable on the balance of current accounts. Net loss and Interest on Capital: Subject to contract between the partners, interest on capitals is to be provided out of profits only. Thus in case of loss, no interest is provided. But in case of insufficient profits (i.e., net profit less than the amount of interest on capital), the amount of profit is distributed in the ratio of capital as partners get profit by way of interest on capital only. 1.9.2 Interest on Drawings Sometimes interest is not only allowed on the capitals, but is also charged on drawings. In such a case, interest will be charged according to the time that elapses between the taking out of the money and the end of the year. Method 1: Product Method: When Unequal amount is withdrawn at different time period. ₹30,00020%[30,000×20100]+[10,000×20100×612]=₹6,000+₹1,000=₹7,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 254}, page_content=\"Suppose , a partner, has drawn the following sum of money - On 29th February, 2022 500 On 31st March, 2022 400 On 30th June, 2022 600 On 31st October, 2022 800 Accounts are closed on 31st December every year.

If the dates on which amounts are drawn are not given, the student will do well to charge interest for six months on the whole of the amount on the assumption that the money was drawn evenly through out the year. In the above example, the total drawings come to ₹ 2,300; and at  for 6 months, the interest comes to ₹ 69 .

If withdrawals are mode at the beginning of each quarter, interest can be calculated by Total drawings  Rate . However, if withdrawals are at end of each quarter, the formula : Total drawings  Rate   will apply. 1.9.3 Guarantee of Minimum Profit Sometimes, one partner can enjoy the right to have minimum amount of profit in a year as per the terms of the partnership agreement. In such case, allocation of profit is done in a normal way if the share of partner, who has been guaranteed minimum profit, is more than the amount of guaranteed profit. However, if share of the partner is less than the guaranteed amount, he takes minimum profit and the excess of guaranteed share of profit over the actual share is borne by the remaining partners as per the agreement. There are three possibilities as far as share of deficiency by other partners is concerned. These are as follows: •Excess is payable by one of the remaining partners. • Excess is payable by at least two or all the partners in an agreed ratio. •Excess is payable by remaining partners in their mutual profit sharing ratio. If the question is silent about the nature of guarantee, the burden of guarantee is borne by the remaining partners in their mutual profit sharing ratio. 1.9.4 Capital ratio Partners may agree to share profits and losses in the capital ratio. When capitals are fixed, profits will be shared in the ratio of given capitals. But if capitals are fluctuating and partners introduce or withdraw capitals during the year, the capitals for the purpose of ratio would be determined with reference to time on the basis of weighted average method. ××100×7.5/12××100×4.5/12'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 256}, page_content='UNIT - 2: TREATMENT OF GOODWILL IN PARTNERSHIP ACCOUNTS  2.1 GOODWILL Goodwill is the value of reputation of a firm in respect of profits expected in future over and above the normal rate of profits. In simpler terms, Goodwill is nothing more than the probability that old customer will resort to old place again and again. The capacity of a business to earn super profits in the future is basically what is meant by term goodwill. Goodwill is an intangible asset; it cannot be seen; it cannot be felt; it cannot be transported physically. Even then it is very real. From accounting point of view, it is necessary that it has some monetary or saleable value. The implication of the term over and above is that there is always a certain normal rate of profits earned by similar firms in the same locality. The excess profit earned by a firm may be due to its locational advantage, better customer service, possession of a unique patent right, personal reputation of the partner or for similar other reasons. The necessity for valuation of goodwill in a firm arises in the following cases: a)When the profit sharing ratio amongst the partners is changed; b)When a new partner is admitted; c)When a partner retires or dies; and d)When the business is dissolved or sold. Let us take a simple example. There is a small Book business owned by a firm. Its net worth i.e. Asset-liabilities, is ₹ 140,000 . Now if a purchaser is willing to pay  for it, the extra  is known in accounting as goodwill. The next question is: Why the purchaser is willing to pay ₹ 10,000 for goodwill. One reason may be the future capability of the business to earn more profit than the normal profit. It may be on account of favourable location. The major factors which affect value of goodwill are as follows: The list is in no way exhaustive but only provides the basic guidelines: i.The quality of the goods sold. ₹150,000₹10,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 257}, page_content=\"ii.The personal reputation of the owners i.e., their ability to attract the customers. iii.The location of the business premises e.g., a good position in a congested market. iv.The possession of near monopoly right e.g. main agent for a particular vehicle like, Maruti car, Bajaj scooter, etc. v.The possession of trademarks and patents. vi.The presence of managerial skill. vii.The cost of research and development which enables the production at low cost and of good quality. viii.The possession of special contracts for the availability of materials RECOMMENDATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD Accounting Standards require an enterprise to recognize an intangible asset, only if and only if, certain conditions are satisfied, namely: i.An intangible asset must have the characteristics of an asset. It means that it must have some value and must be clearly identifiable, so that it can be sold without disposing other assets or future benefits flowing from other assets. ii.An intangible asset should be recognized only if the future probable economic benefits (i.e., increased revenue from sales) will flow to the business enterprise and not to others. It means that management can make reasonable estimates of future benefits. iii.The cost of the intangible asset can be measured reliably, that is, the cost is objectively verifiable. If the cost cannot be measured reliably, then it cannot be recognized as an asset. It is thus clear that none of the conditions is satisfied by internally generated goodwill or inherent goodwill. The reasons are simple to explain. First, it is not an identifiable resource like patent, trademark or copyright. Second, it is very difficult to assess its future benefits. Finally, the cost of internally generated goodwill cannot be reliably measured in the absence of any consideration in money or money' worth. There is no documentary evidence to support the value of goodwill as a resource. Goodwill should be recorded in the books only when some consideration in money or money' worth has been paid for it. Accordingly, on admission or retirement/death of a partner or even when there is a change in profit sharing\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 258}, page_content=\"ratio amongst the existing partners, goodwill should not be raised in the books of account of the partnership firm because no consideration in money or money' worth has been paid for it. The conclusion is that only purchased goodwill should be recorded in the books of account whether the payment is made directly in cash or money' worth. For example, '  ' and '  ' purchase the net assets (assets minus liabilities) of '  ' amounting to ₹ 2,50,000 for ₹ 3,00,000 in cash, the additional payment of ₹ 50,000 is a payment for goodwill in cash. It is a case of purchased goodwill (an asset) and can be validly recorded in the books of A and B. When no payment is made for the purchase of goodwill and goodwill account is raised in the books, it is a case of internally generated goodwill or inherent goodwill and as per Accounting Standards, it is not permitted. For example, in the event of reconstitution of the firm due to admission, or retirement or death of a partner or even a change in the profit sharing ratio without reconstitution, goodwill of the firm is evaluated. In such a situation, the value of goodwill should not be brought into books of account because it is inherent or self-generated goodwill since no money or money' worth has been paid for it. The only way out is that the value of goodwill as calculated with the help of different valuation methods should be adjusted through capital accounts of the partner(s) of the firm. In no case the goodwill account is to be raised in the books of account, either on the reconstitution of the firm or change in the profit sharing ratio. The amount of goodwill is written off over a period of time. In case when the goodwill account exists at the time of reconstitution of firm, it should be written off immediately whether it is internally generated or goodwill has been bought for some consideration. 2.2 METHODS FOR GOODWILL VALUATION There are three methods for valuation of goodwill 1.Average profit basis,-Simple and Weighted 2.Super profit basis,--Number of Year Purchase, Annuity basis, and Capitalization of Super Profit 3.Capitalization basis- Average Profits (1) Average Profit Basis: In this case the average profits of past years are adjusted for any expected change in future. The number of year are decided on the basis of judgement and negotiation. •For averaging the past profit, either simple average or weighted average may be employed depending upon the circumstances. If there exists clear increasing or decreasing trend of profits, it is better to give more weight to the profits of the recent years than those of earlier years. But, if there is no clear trend of profit, it is better to go by simple average.

However, if any such trend is not visible from the figures of past profits, then one should take simple average profit and calculate goodwill accordingly. Let us suppose, profits of a partnership firm for five years were ₹ 30,000 , ₹ 25,000 , ₹ 20,000 , ₹ 30,000 and ₹ 28,000 . In this case, there is no clear increasing or decreasing trend of profit. So average profit comes to ₹ 26,600 (arrived at by taking simple average).

Super Profit=Actual Profit-Normal Profit Actual Profit is average maintainable profit Normal Profit=Normal rate of Return (NRR)  Capital Employed The rationale for using the super profit is the partner who gains excess earning owing to reconstitution of firm should compensate to partners sacrificing their share in the reconstitution. Super profit means, excess profit that can be earned by a firm over and above the normal profit usually earned by similar firms under similar circumstances. Under this method, the partner who gains in terms of profit sharing ratio has to contribute only for excess profit because normal profit he can earn by joining any partnership firm. Under super profit method, what excess profit a partnership firm can earn is to be determined first. Calculation of super profit: i.Identify the capital employed by the partnership firm; ii.Identify the average profit earned by the partnership firm based on past few years' figures; iii.Determine normal rate of return prevailing in the locality of similar firms; iv.Apply normal rate of return on capital employed to arrive at normal profit; v.Deduct normal profit from the average profit of the firm. If the average profit of the firm is more than the normal profit, there exists super profit and goodwill. Let us suppose, total capital employed by a partnership firm was ₹ 1,00,000 and its average profit was ₹ 25,000 . Normal rate of return is  in case of similar firms working under similar conditions. So, normal profit is  and average profit is . The partnership firm earns ₹ 3,000 super profit. a)Number of Years Purchase Method: Goodwill is generally valued by multiplying the amount of super profit by certain number of years depending upon the expectation about the maintenance of such profit in future. If it is expected that the super profit can be maintained for another five years in future, then value of goodwill may be taken as ₹  = ₹ 15,000 . b)Annuity Method: The major drawback of number of number of years purchase method is that time value of money is not considered. Although it was expected that super profit would be earned in five future years, still no devaluation was done on the value of money for the time difference.

Those who are sacrificing future profit should be compensated by the others who are gaining. This adjustment of the partnership rights may arise due to admission of a new partner, change in the profit sharing ratio, retirement or death of a partner and a dissolution of the partnership. The partners, who gain in terms of profit sharing ratio, have to pay for such gain as a proportion to the value of goodwill. The partners, who lose in terms of profit sharing ratio, receive payments for the sacrifice as a proportion to the value of goodwill. 2.4 VALUATION OF GOODWILL IN CASE OF ADMISSION OF A PARTNER When a new partner is admitted into a partnership, certain adjustments in accounts become necessary. Chiefly, this is because the new partner will acquire a share in the profits of the firm and because of this, the old partners will stand to lose. Suppose, A and B are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2. If their profits are , A will get  and  will get . If  is admitted and ==₹1,00,00015%=20,00015%=₹1,33,333=₹1,33,333−₹1,00,000=\\n₹20,000₹12,000B₹8,000C'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 263}, page_content=\"given one fourth share in profits, then out of  he will get . The remaining  will be divided between  and ; A will get  and  will get . Thus on C's admission A loses ₹ 3,000 per year and  loses  per year.  will have to compensate  and  for this loss. It is no argument to say that on  's admission the profits will not remain at ₹ 20,000; extra profits will arise and therefore, A and B will both get more than what they previously got. But it should be noted that the additional profits will be earned by the combined efforts of all the partners  and . Therefore, if  and  get a share of the extra profits they are not particularly obliged to . Out of the present profits of ₹ 20,000 they have to give up a share in favour of  and, therefore, they are entitled to a compensation. The problem of compensation is the chief problem while dealing with admission of a partner. This is tackled through goodwill. But one point should be made clear here. Goodwill is a compensation to old partners for their sacrifice in connection with admission of a new partner. So it is to be credited to the partners according to their profit sacrificing ratio. Whatever share the new partner is getting, it may be sacrificed by the old partners in proportion to their old profit sharing ratio or in different proportion. For example, Nigam and Dhameja are in partnership sharing profits and losses equally. They agreed to take Ghosh as one-third partner. Now one-third share of Ghosh may come out of sacrifice made by Nigam and Dhameja equally (i.e. at their old profit sharing ratio). See the following profit sharing pattern: Profit Sharing Pattern Partners Nigam and Dhameja both originally had equal profit shares of 1/2. After the reconstitution of the partnership, Nigam's new share is calculated as 1/2 minus 1/3 (being his share of Ghosh's incoming 1/3 share), resulting in a new share of 1/3. This represents a sacrifice of 1/6 from his original share. Similarly, Dhameja's new share is also 1/3, resulting in the same sacrifice of 1/6. Ghosh, a new partner, acquires a 1/3 share in the profits, which is the sum of the sacrifices made by Nigam and Dhameja. In other words, one-third share of Ghosh was borne by Nigam and Dhameja at their old profit sharing ratio. By this process Nigam sacrificed  in share and Dhameja sacrificed  in share. So the profit sacrificing ratio becomes: Nigam      = Dhameja 1/6             =  1/6   1       : 1 Which is the same as old profit sharing ratio. ₹20,000₹5,000₹15,000AB₹9,000B₹6,000B₹2,000CABA,BCABCC\\n1/2−1/3=1/61/2−1/3=/1/6\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 264}, page_content=\"But if the new profit sharing ratio of Nigam, Dhameja and Ghosh becomes 4:2:3, then profit sacrificed by Nigam and Dhameja on Ghosh's admission is not at the old profit sharing ratio. In this case profit sacrificing ratio is as follows: Nigam  Dhameja  i.e. 1 : 5 If Ghosh pays goodwill of ₹ 24,000, then in the first case, Nigam and Dhameja should share it equally; but in second case Nigam should get ₹ 4,000 and Dhameja should get ₹ 20,000. Take another example: Nigam and Dhameja are equal partners. They agreed to take Ghosh as one-third partner. The new profit sharing ratio is 4:2:3. Nigam and Dhameja agreed  as value of goodwill.

Therefore, only purchased goodwill should be recorded in the books of the firm. In case of admission of a partner, goodwill cannot be raised in the books of the firm because no consideration in money or money's worth is paid for it. If the incoming partner brings any premium over and above his capital contribution at the time of his admission, such premium should be distributed to other existing partners. When a new partner is admitted to a firm, the old partners generally sacrifice in favour of the new partner in terms of lower profit sharing ratio in the future. Therefore, the premium for goodwill brought in by the new partner shall be given to the existing partners on the basis of profit sacrificing ratio. The profit sacrificing ratio is \\xa0=\\xa01/2−4/9=1/18\\xa0=\\xa01/2−2/9=5/18\\n₹27,000\\n27,000×1/1827,000×5/18\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 265}, page_content=\"computed by deducting the new profit sharing ratio from the old profit sharing ratio. If the difference is positive, then there is a profit sacrifice and in case the difference is negative, then there is a gain in terms of higher future profit sharing ratio. In case of admission of a partner, only those existing partners are entitled to a share for goodwill who have sacrificed a part of their profits in favour of the new partner. Sometimes, goodwill may be evaluated in case of admission of a partner when incoming partner is unable to bring in cash any premium for goodwill. In that situation also, the value of goodwill should not be raised in the books since it is inherent goodwill. Rather it is preferable that such value of goodwill should be adjusted through partners' capital accounts. It may also be noted that when the incoming partner pays any premium for goodwill privately to the existing partners, no entry is required in the books of the firm. In that case, the amount to be paid to each partner should be calculated as per the profit sacrificing ratio. If only new partner's profit sharing is given then profit sacrificing ratio of old paterns would be same as old profit sharing ratio. 2.7 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF GOODWILL IN CASE OF RETIREMENT OR DEATH OF A PARTNER In case of retirement of a partner, the continuing partners will gain in terms of profit sharing ratio. Therefore, they have to pay to retiring partner for his share of goodwill in the firm in the gaining ratio. Similarly, in case of death of the partner, the continuing partners should bear the share of goodwill due to the heirs of the deceased partner. For this purpose, the goodwill is valued on the date of the retirement or death and adjusted through the capital accounts of the partners.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 266}, page_content='UNIT - 3: ADMISSION OF A NEW PARTNER 3.1 INTRODUCTION New partners are admitted for the benefit of the partnership firm. New partner is admitted either for increasing the partnership capital or for strengthening the management of the firm. When a new partner joins a firm, it is desirable to bring all appreciation or reduction in the value of assets into accounts as on the date of admission. Similarly, if the books contain any liability which has not been paid or if the books do not contain a liability which has to be paid, suitable entries should be passed. The purpose of such entries is to make an updated Balance Sheet on the date of admission. Also, all profits which have accrued but not yet brought into books and similarly, all losses which have occurred but not recorded, should now be brought into books so that the Capital Accounts of the old partners reflect the proper figure. As a result of passing of such entries, any subsequent profits or losses will be automatically shared by the incoming partner along with old partners. Also the value of goodwill is to be assessed and proper accounting treatment is required to bring the value of goodwill into books of accounts. Treatment for goodwill has already been discussed in unit 2 of this chapter. 3.2 REVALUATION ACCOUNT OR PROFIT AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT ACCOUNT When a new partner is admitted into the partnership, assets are revalued and liabilities are reassessed. A Revaluation Account (or Profit and Loss Adjustment Account) is opened for the purpose. This account is debited with all reduction in the value of assets and increase in liabilities and credited with increase in the value of assets and decrease in the value of liabilities. The difference in two sides of the account will show profit or loss. This is transferred to the Capital Accounts of old partners in the old profit sharing ratio. The entries to be passed are: Journal Entries for Revaluation of Assets and Liabilities in Partnership When revaluing assets and liabilities in a partnership, the following journal entries are made: 1.Revaluation Account Entries:'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 267}, page_content=\"Debit (Dr.) Revaluation Account for decreases in asset values.

Debit (Dr.) Liability Accounts for any reduction in liabilities. Credit (Cr.) Revaluation Account for both the above entries. 3.Profit or Loss on Revaluation: Debit (Dr.) Revaluation Account for the profit resulting from revaluation, which is then credited to the Capital Accounts of the old partners according to the old profit-sharing ratio. If there is a loss on revaluation, Debit (Dr.) the Capital Accounts of the old partners and Credit (Cr.) the Revaluation Account, again according to the old profit-sharing ratio. These entries ensure that any changes in the value of the firm's assets and liabilities are accurately reflected in the accounts and that the effects on the partners' capital accounts are allocated according to the previously agreed-upon profit-sharing arrangement. As a result of the above entries, the capital account balances of the old partners will change and the assets and liabilities will have to be adjusted to their proper values. They will now appear in the Balance Sheet at revised figures. When the revised values are not to be Recognised in the books Sometimes all the partners including the new partner may agree to keep the assets and liabilities at the old values even when they agree to revalue them. To record these, a Memorandum Revaluation Account is opened. This account is divided into two parts. a)In the first part the entries for the revaluation of assets and liabilities are made in the usual way as explained earlier. No record for the revaluation of assets and liabilities is made through the respective ledger accounts. The resultant profit or loss on revaluation in the first part of this account is transferred to the capital accounts of old partners only in the old profit and loss sharing ratio. b)In order to complete the double entry, entries made in the first part of Memorandum Revaluation Account are reversed in the second part so that the values of the assets and liabilities remain unchanged.

Thus if there is a profit in the first part there will be a loss of the same amount in the second part. The only point to be remembered is that the result of the first part of Memorandum Revaluation Account is shared by old partners in the old profit sharing ratio, while the result of the second part is shared by all partners including the new one in the new profit sharing ratio. Alternatively, the partners may agree that revalued figures will not be shown in the Balance Sheet and Assets and liabilities would appear in the Balance Sheet at their old values. In this case, Memorandum Revaluation Account is opened. Any increase in the value of assets and/or decrease in the liabilities is credited to Memorandum Revaluation Account.

Conversely, if the first half of the Memorandum Revaluation Account shows a loss, the later half of the Memorandum Revaluation Account must show a profit. When a Memorandum Revaluation Account is prepared, the book values of assets and liabilities do not change. In effect, the resultant profit or loss on revaluation is adjusted through the Partners' Capital Accounts. In this way, the amount invested as a capital by the incoming partner may be set at a level that reflects the current fair value of the partnership, even though the book values of assets and liabilities of the existing partnership remain unchanged in the books of accounts. In case partners desire to disclose assets and liabilities in the balance sheet at old figures without opening Revaluation account then the change (i.e. increase or decrease) in the value of assets and liabilities may be adjusted through Partners' Capital Accounts directly. Difference between Revaluation Account and Memorandum Revaluation Account 1.Revaluation account is prepared to find out the profit or loss on revaluation of assets and liabilities which appear in the new balance sheet at the new or revalued figures. Memorandum revaluation account is also prepared to record the effect of revaluation of assets and liabilities which of course are recorded at their old figures in the new balance sheet.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 270}, page_content=\"2.Revaluation account is not divided into two parts. But the memorandum revaluation account has two parts: first part for old partners and second part for all partners including the new partner. 3.The net result of revaluation of assets and liabilities in the revaluation account is transferred to old partners' capital accounts in the old profit sharing ratio. In the case of memorandum revaluation account the first part is used to record the changes in the values of assets and liabilities due to revaluation and in the second part the effect of the first part is cancelled. The balance of the first part is transferred to old partner's capital accounts in the old profit sharing ratio while the balance of the second part is transferred to all partners including the new partner in the new profit sharing ratio. 3.3 RESERVES IN THE BALANCE SHEET Whenever a new partner is admitted, any reserve etc. appearing in the Balance Sheet should be transferred to the Capital Accounts of the old partners in the old profit sharing ratio.

Other partners may continue to run the business of the firm. Readjustment takes place in case of retirement of a partner likewise the case of admission of a partner. Whenever a partner retires, the continuing partners make gain in terms of profit sharing ratio. Therefore, the remaining partners arrange for the amount to be paid to discharge the claims of the retiring partners. Assets and liabilities are revalued, value of goodwill is raised and surrender value of joint life policy, if any, is taken into account. Revaluation profit and reserves are transferred to capital or current accounts of partners. Lastly, final amount due to the retiring partner is determined and discharged. 4.2.CALCULATION OF GAINING RATIO On retirement of a partner, the continuing partners will gain in terms of profit sharing ratio. For example, if  and  were sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 5:3:2 and  retires, then  and  have to decide at which ratio they will share profits and losses in future. If it is decided that the continuing partners will share profits and losses in future at the ratio of 3:2, then A gains 1/10th [(3/5)-(5/10)] and C gains 2/10 [(2/5)-(2/10)]. So the gaining ratio between  and  is . If  and  decide to continue at the ratio , this indicates that they are dividing the gained share in the previous profit sharing ratio. Thus, on the retirement or death of a partner, his share in the profit would be taken by the remaining partners. In other words, they get additional share which is obviously a gain or benefit. The calculation of gaining ratio or benefit ratio is done as follows: A,BCBACAC1:2AC5:2'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 273}, page_content='i.When the new ratio is given, gaining ratio is calculated by deducting their new share of profits from the old share. ii.When the new profit sharing ratio is not given and the remaining partners share the future profits in the same ratio as before, the gaining ratio would be the old profit sharing ratio. Observe the following table: Ratio between Remaining Partners 1.When new ratio is given: As given in the examination problem; Gaining or Benefit Ratio: New Ratio minus Old ratio. 2.When the new Ratio is not given: The same old ratios between them; Gaining or Benefit Ratio: The same old ratios between them. 3.When gaining or benefit ratio is given: Old ratio + Gaining ratio; Gaining or Benefit Ratio: As given in the question.

If there is revaluation profit, then such profit should be distributed amongst the existing partners including the retiring partner at the existing profit sharing ratio. On the other hand, if there is loss on revaluation that is also to be distributed to all the partners including the retiring partner at the existing profit sharing ratio. To arrive at, profit or loss on revaluation of assets and liabilities, a Revaluation Account or Profit and Loss Adjustment Account is opened.

However, sometimes it is stated that the loan is to be paid off in so many equal instalments and that the balance is to carry interest. In such case, what should be done is that the loan should be divided into equal parts. The interest for the period should be calculated and the payment should consist of the instalment on account of the loan plus interest for the period.

The firm pays the premium and the amount of policy is payable to the firm on the death of any partner or on the maturity of policy whichever is earlier. The objective of taking such a policy is to minimize the financial hardships to the event of payment of a large sum to the legal representatives of a deceased partner or to the retiring partner. The accounting treatment for the premium paid and the Joint Life Policy may be on any of the following ways: 1.When premium paid is treated as an expense: When premium is treated as an expense then it is closed every year by transferring to profit and loss account. In this case complete amount received from the insurance company either on a surrender of policy or on the death of the partner becomes a gain.

At the end of the year the amount in excess of surrender value is treated as a loss and is transferred to Profit and Loss Account. In this case the amount received from the insurance company in excess of the surrender value results in a gain at the time of receipt of such amount\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 283}, page_content=\"which is transferred to Capital Accounts of the partners in the profit sharing ratio. 3.Creation of Joint Policy Reserve Account: Under this method, premium paid is debited to policy account and credited to bank account. At the end of the year, amount equal to premium is transferred from Profit and Loss Appropriation Account to Policy Reserve Account. After this, policy account is brought down to its surrender value by debiting the life policy reserve account with amount which exceeds the surrender value of the policy. Thus, in this method, policy account appears on the assets side and policy reserve account appears on the liabilities side of the Balance Sheet until it is realized. Both these accounts appear in the Balance Sheet at the surrender value of the policy. This method is different from the method discussed in (2) above only in respect of reserve account. On the death of a partner Joint Life Policy Reserve Account is transferred to Joint Life Policy Account and then the balance is transferred to Partners' Capital Accounts. 4.8.SEPARATE LIFE POLICY Instead of life policy taken jointly on the name of all the partners, all the partners may take individual life policies for each of them by paying the premium from the firm. In the event of retirement, the retired partner is entitled for the proportionate amount of the life policies of all the partners. Example: Sona, Gabbu and Amit are partners Profit sharing ratio is 3:1:1 Policy values and surrender values for Sona, Gabbu, and Amit are as follows: ➢Sona has a policy valued at ₹1,00,000 with a surrender value of ₹10,000. ➢Gabbu has a policy valued at ₹2,00,000 with a surrender value of ₹20,000. ➢Amit has a policy valued at ₹3,00,000 with a surrender value of ₹30,000.

Other partners shall continue to run the business of the firm. The problems arising on the death of a partner are similar to those arising on retirement. Assets and liabilities have to be revalued and the resultant profit or loss has to be transferred to the capital accounts of all partners including the deceased partner. Goodwill is dealt with exactly in the way already discussed in the case of retirement in the earlier unit. Treatment of joint life policy will also be same as in the case of retirement. However, in case of death of a partner, the firm would get the joint policy value. 5.2.RIGHT OF OUTGOING PARTNER IN CERTAIN CASES TO SHARE SUBSEQUENT PROFITS As per provisions of Section 37 of the Indian Partnership Act., \"Where any member of a firm has died or otherwise ceased to be a partner, and the surviving or continuing partners carry on the business of the firm with the property of the firm without any final settlement of accounts as between them and the outgoing partner or his estate, then, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, the outgoing partner or his estate is entitled at the option of himself or his representatives to such share of the profits made since he ceased to be a partner as may be attributable to the use of his share of the property of the firm or to interest at the rate of six per cent per annum on the amount of his share in the property of the firm.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 285}, page_content='Provided that whereby contract between the partners an option is given to surviving or continuing partners to purchase the interest of a deceased or outgoing partner, and that option is duly exercised, the estate of the deceased partner, or the outgoing partner or his estate, as the case may be, is not entitled to any further or other share of profits; but if any partner assuming to act in exercise of the option does not in all material respects comply with the terms thereof, he is liable to account under the foregoing provisions of this section. This way, the outgoing partner has the option to receive, interest at the rate of  p.a. or the share of profit earned on the unsettled amounts for the period till his dues are settled by the firm in the absence of any contract made to the contrary\". It may be noted that the outgoing partner is not bound to make election until the share of the profit that would be payable to him has been ascertained. For example, A, B and C are in a partnership business-sharing profits and losses equally. C died on 31st October, 2021. The capitals of the partners, after all necessary adjustments stood at ,  and  respectively. A and B continued to carry on the business further without settling the accounts of C. Final payment to C is made on February 1, 2022. The profit made during the period of three months amounts to ₹ 28,000 .

If partner expires, then partners are entitled for share in JLP. Accounting for Joint Life Policy in Partnerships A Joint Life Policy (JLP) is a life insurance policy that covers the lives of all partners in a partnership firm. Upon the death of a partner or at the policy's maturity, the proceeds are used within the firm's financial management. There are several methods for accounting for a JLP: 1.Premium Method: This method accounts for the JLP by considering the premiums paid by the partnership as an expense. No asset is recognized on the balance sheet for the policy itself; instead, the premiums are treated as a periodic cost. 2.Surrender Value Method: In this approach, the JLP is recognized as an asset at its surrender value. This is the amount the partnership would receive if the policy were canceled. The difference between the premiums paid and the surrender value is treated as an expense or income, depending on whether the surrender value is less or more than the premiums paid. 3.Joint Life Policy Reserve Method: This method involves creating a reserve account for the JLP. The reserve is built up by the amount of premiums paid, less any surrender value received. The reserve represents the policy's value to the firm and is used to reflect the firm's interest in the policy's future benefits. Each of these methods has implications for how the partnership's financial statements are presented and how the benefits of the JLP are realized and distributed among the partners. Method 1: If Joint Life Policy does not appear in the Balance Sheet, then the firm will gain on the death of a partner. For example, A, B and C are in partnership sharing profits and losses at the ratio of 5:3:2. They took a Joint Life Policy of . Now, if  dies, the firm will receive  from the insurance company. The journal entries will appear as follows: i.Bank A/c Dr. ₹1,00,000 ₹1,00,000A₹1,00,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 288}, page_content=\"To Joint Life Policy A/c ₹1,00,000 (Policy value received from the insurance company on A’s death) ii.Joint Life Policy A/c Dr. ₹1,00,000 To A’s Capital A/c ₹50,000 To B’s Capital A/c ₹30,000 To C’s Capital A/c ₹20,000 (Joint Life Policy written off and credited to old partners in Profit Sharing Ratio) Method 2: If Joint Life Policy appears in the Balance Sheet at surrender value, then the firm will gain on the death of a partner. For example,  and  are in partnership sharing profits and losses at the ratio of 5:3:2. They took a Joint Life Policy of  which is appearing in the Balance Sheet at the surrender value of . Now, if A dies, the firm will receive ₹  from the insurance company.

Joint Life Policy A/c Dr. ₹90,000 To A’s Capital A/c ₹45,000 To B’s Capital A/c ₹27,000 To C’s Capital A/c ₹18,000 (Joint Life Policy written off and credited to old partners in Profit Sharing Ratio) Method 3:If Joint Life Policy appears in the Balance Sheet at surrender value along with Joint Life Policy Reserve, then the firm will gain on the death of a partner and reserve will be distributed among partners. For example,  and  are in partnership sharing profits and losses at the ratio of 5:3:2. They took a Joint Life Policy of  which is appearing in the Balance Sheet at the surrender value of ,along with JLP reserve. Now, if A dies, the firm will receive  from the insurance company. The journal entries will appear as follows: To B's Capital A/c A,BC₹1,00,000₹10,0001,00,000\\nA,BC₹1,00,000₹10,000₹1,00,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 289}, page_content=\"To C's Capital A/c (Joint Life Policy reserved written off and credited to old partners in Profit Sharing Ratio) 5.5.SPECIAL TRANSACTIONS IN CASE OF DEATH: SEPARATE LIFE POLICY Instead of taking one joint life policy in the names of all the partners, the partners may take individual policies on the lives of respective partners. The premium paid is charged to profit and loss account. On the death of a partner then only the amount for which the deceased partner was insured would be recovered from the insurance company. The policies of the surviving partners will continue to survive but the surrender value of the policies of the surviving partners would also be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the amount payable to the legal representatives of the deceased partner. In other words the legal representatives would be entitled to receive share in surrender value equivalent to the profit sharing ratio of the deceased.

In this Unit, we will discuss the circumstances leading to the dissolution of a partnership firm and accounting treatment necessary to close its books of accounts. Also, we will discuss the special problems relating to the insolvency of partners and the settlement of the partnership's liabilities. 6.2.CIRCUMSTANCES  LEADIN  TO DISSOLUTION OF  PARTNERSHIP A partnership is dissolved or comes to an end on: a)the expiry of the term for which it was formed;\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 292}, page_content='b)completion of the venture for which it was entered into;  c)death of a partner; d)insolvency of a partner. This list appears to be conditions or events that trigger a specific action or outcome, possibly in a legal or business context, such as the termination or dissolution of an agreement or partnership when any of these conditions are met. However, the partners or remaining partners (in case of death or insolvency) may continue to do the business. In such a case there will be a new partnership but the firm will continue. When the business comes to an end then only it will be said that the firm has been dissolved. A firm stands dissolved in the following cases: i.The partners agree that the firm should be dissolved; ii.All partners except one become insolvent; iii.The business becomes illegal; iv.In case of partnership at will, a partner gives notice of dissolution; and v.The court orders dissolution. The court has the option to order dissolution of a firm in the following circumstances: a)Where a partner has become of unsound mind; b)Where a partner suffers from permanent incapacity; c)Where a partner is guilty of misconduct of the business; d)Where a partner persistently disregards the partnership agreement; e)Where a partner transfers his interest or share to a third party; f)Where the business cannot be carried on except at a loss; and g)Where it appears to be just and equitable. 6.3.CONSEQUENCES OF DISSOLUTION On the dissolution of a partnership, firstly, the assets of the firm, including goodwill, are realized. Then the amount realized, is applied first towards repayment of liabilities to outsiders and loans taken from partners; afterwards, the capital contributed by partners is repaid and, if there is still a surplus, it is distributed among the partners in their profit-sharing ratio.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 293}, page_content='Conversely, after payment of liabilities of the firm and repayment of loans from partners, if the assets of the firm leftover are insufficient to repay in full the capital contributed by each partner, the deficiency is borne by the partners in their profit-sharing ratio. According to the provisions contained in section 48 of the Partnership Act, upon dissolution of the partnership, the mutual rights of the partners, unless otherwise agreed upon, are settled in the following manner: a)Losses including deficiencies of capital are paid, first out of profits, next out of capital, and, lastly, if necessary, by the partners individually in the proportion in which they are entitled to share profits. b)The assets of the firm, including any sums contributed by the partners to make up deficiencies of capital have to be applied in the following manner and order: i.in paying the debts of the firm to third parties; ii.in paying to each partner rateably what is due to him from the firm in respect of advances as distinguished from capital; iii.in paying to each partner what is due to him on account of capital; and iv.the residue, if any, to be divided among the partners in the proportion in which they are entitled to share profits. Distinction between Dissolution of Partnership and Dissolution of Partnership Firm Dissolution of Partnership ➢Dissolution of a partnership refers to the discontinuance of the relation between the partners of the firm. ➢There can be a change in profit-sharing ratio or admission/death/retirement of a partner. ➢In the event of dissolution of the partnership, the business continues as usual, but the partnership is reconstituted. ➢There is no intervention by the court.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 294}, page_content='➢Economic relationships among partners may remain the same or change. ➢Assets and liabilities are revalued. A new balance sheet is prepared. ➢Revaluation account is prepared. ➢Assets and liabilities are revalued after winding up of the existing partnership. ➢Books of accounts are not closed. Dissolution of Partnership Firm ➢Dissolution of the firm implies that the entire firm ceases to exist, including the relation among all the partners. ➢Dissolution of partnership firm occurs. ➢In the event of the dissolution of the firm, the business ceases to end. ➢Court has the inherent power to intervene. By its order, a firm can be dissolved. ➢Economic relationship among partners comes to an end. ➢Assets are sold and realized. Liabilities are paid off. ➢Realization account is prepared. ➢Assets and liabilities are settled on winding up of a firm. ➢Books of accounts are closed. 6.3.1 Dissolution before the expiry of a fixed term A partner who, on admission, pays a premium to the other partners with a stipulation that the firm will not be dissolved before the expiry of a certain term, will be entitled to a suitable refund of premium or of such part as may be reasonable, if the firm is dissolved before the term has expired. No claims in this respect will arise if'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 295}, page_content=\"1)the firm is dissolved due to the death of a partner; 2)the dissolution is mainly due to the partner's (claiming refund) own misconduct; and 3)the dissolution is in pursuance of an agreement containing no provision for the return of the premium or any part of it. The amount to be repaid will be such as is reasonable having regard to the terms upon which the admission was made and to the length of the period agreed upon and that already expired. Any amount that becomes due will be borne by other partners in their profit- sharing ratio. 6.4.CLOSING OF PARTNERSHIP BOOKS DISSOLUTION To close books of accounts of Partnership Firm. We need to transfer all the assets and liabilities to Realization Account. Given below is the specimen of the Realization Account. Specimen of Realization Account Debit Side: To Sundry Assets (Excluding Cash/Bank, Debit Balance of P&L A/c, Partners’ Current, Capital, and Loan A/cs) To Bank/Cash (expenses for Realization) To Bank/Cash A/c (Amount paid for liabilities and unrecorded liabilities) To Partners’ Capital A/cs (Expenses or Liabilities paid by partners) To Partners’ Capital A/cs (Profit on realization distributed among partners in profit-sharing ratio) Credit Side: By Sundry Liabilities (Excluding Credit Balance of P&L A/c, Partners’ Current, Capital, and Loan A/c) By Provision on Assets By Bank/Cash A/c (Amount realized from assets and unrecorded assets) By Partners’ Capital A/cs (Assets taken over by partners) By Partners’ Capital A/cs (Loss on realization distributed among partners in profit-sharing ratio) This table is typical in accounting to represent how the realizations (sale of assets and payment of liabilities) are recorded. The debit entries represent the charges or the uses of funds, including expenses and distributions to partners, while the credit entries represent the sources of funds, including liabilities settled and\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 296}, page_content=\"amounts realized from asset sales. The final entries on both sides deal with the distribution of profit or loss from the realization process to the partners according to their agreed-upon shares. 6.4.1 Treatment of Goodwill at the time of dissolution of Firm Treatment of Goodwill •If Goodwill appears in the Balance Sheet, it is considered as purchased Goodwill and is treated like any other asset and is transferred to realization account. •If Goodwill does not appear in the balance sheet, no entry is required for this. •If something is realized or Goodwill is purchased by any one of the partners, then either Cash Account is debited or Partner's Capital A/c is debited and Realization Account is credited. We will understand how to close the books of accounts through illustration the required journal entries to be made for closing the books of a firm with the example given below:                                    Balance Sheet of Fast and Quick as at Dec. 31, 2021 Liabilities: Sundry Creditors: ₹20,000 Fast's Loan: ₹10,000 General Reserve: ₹10,000 Capitals: Fast: ₹30,000 Quick: ₹25,000 Total Capitals: ₹55,000 Total Liabilities: ₹95,000 Assets: Plant and Machinery: ₹40,000 Patents: ₹6,000 Stock: ₹25,000\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 297}, page_content='Sundry Debtors: ₹19,000 Less: Provision for doubtful debts: ₹1,000 Net Sundry Debtors: ₹18,000 Cash: ₹6,000 Total Assets: ₹95,000 Fast and Quick share profits in the ratio of 3:2. On 1st January, 2022 the firm was dissolved. Fast took over the patents at a valuation of . The other assets realized as under: Plant and Machinery: ₹45,000 Stock: ₹22,000 Sundry Debtors: ₹18,500 Total: ₹85,500 The Sundry Creditors were paid off at a discount of . The expense amounted to ₹ 3,500 . The steps to close the books are given below: I.Open a Realization Account and transfer all assets except cash in hand or at a bank at book values. Realization Account is debited and the various assets are credited and thus closed. It should be remembered that Sundry Debtors and Provisions for Bad Debts Accounts are two separate accounts and the gross amount of debtors should be transferred. In the above example the entry will be: Realization Account Dr. ₹90,000 To Plant and Machinery Account ₹40,000 To Patents Account ₹6,000 To Stock Account ₹25,000 To Sundry Debtors ₹19,000 (Transfer of various assets to the debit side of Realization Account) II.Transfer of liabilities to outsiders and provisions and reserves against assets (e.g., Provision for Doubtful Debts) to the credit side of Realization account. The accounts of the liabilities and provisions will be debited and thus closed. The entry should be at book figures. The entry will be: Sundry Creditors Account Dr. ₹20,000 Provision for Doubtful Debts Account Dr. ₹1,000 To Realization Account ₹21,000 ₹5,0005%'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 298}, page_content='(Transfer of liabilities to outsiders and provision against debtors to Realization Account) Note: Accounts denoting accumulated losses or profits should not be transferred to the Realization Account. III.i.The Realization Account should be credited with the actual amount realized by the sale of assets. This should take no note of the book figures. of course, Cash (or Bank) Account will be debited. Thus: Cash Account Dr. ₹85,500 To Realization Account ₹85,500 (Amount realized by the sale of various assets) ii.If a partner takes over an asset, his Capital Account should be debited and Realization Account credited with the value agreed upon, Thus: Fast’s Capital Account Dr. 5,000 To Realization Account 5,000 (Patents taken over by Fast at ₹ 5,000) IV.Expenses of dissolution or realization of assets are debited to the Realization Account and credited to Cash Account.

VI.At this stage, the Realization Account will show profit or loss. If the debit side is bigger, there is a loss; if the credit side is bigger, there is a profit.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 299}, page_content=\"Profit or loss is transferred to the Capital Accounts of partners in the profit-sharing ratio. In the case of profit, Realization Account is debited and Capital Accounts are credited. The entry for loss is, naturally, reverse of this entry. The Realization Account in the example given above shows a loss of ₹ 1,000 (see account below). Fast’s Capital Account Dr. 600 Quick's Capital Account Dr. 400 To Realization Account 1,000 (Transfer of loss to Capital Account in the ratio of 3:2) VII.Partner's Loans if any, should now be paid. The entry is to debit the Loan Account and credit Cash Account. Thus: The document shows a journal entry for the repayment of a loan. The entry debits Fast’s Loan Account by ₹10,000, indicating a decrease in the liability associated with the loan. Correspondingly, the Cash Account is credited by the same amount, indicating a reduction in the cash balance of the firm due to the repayment of Fast’s loan. This entry effectively records the settlement of the loan payable to Fast. VIII.Any reserve of accumulated profit or loss lying in the books (as shown by the Balance Sheet) should be transferred to the Capital Account in the profit-sharing ratio. Thus: The document displays a journal entry concerning the distribution of a General Reserve. The General Reserve account is debited by ₹10,000, signifying the utilization of reserved funds. Concurrently, Fast’s Capital Account is credited by ₹6,000 and Quick’s Capital Account is credited by ₹4,000. This entry records the allocation of the General Reserve into the respective capital accounts of partners Fast and Quick, adhering to the agreed-upon sharing ratio of 3:2. IX.At this stage the Capital Accounts of partners will show how much amount is due to them or from them. The partner owing money to the firm will pay; Cash Account will be debited and his Capital Account credited and thus closed. Money owing to a partner will be paid to him; his Capital Account will be debited and the Cash Account credited. This will close the Capital Accounts' as well as the Cash Account.

In that case, the amount paid in respect of the liabilities in cash should be debited to the Realization Account, Cash Account being credited. If liability is taken over by a partner, Realization Account should be debited and the Partners' Capital A/cs credited at the figure agreed upon. 4.The balance of the Realization Account will represent either the profit or loss on realization. Divide it between the partners in the proportion in which they shared profits and losses. In the case of a loss, credit Realization Account and debit various partners' Capital Accounts; follow the opposite course in the case of a profit. 5.Pay off the partners' loans or advances which are separate from the capital (if any) contributed by them, after setting off against them any debit balance in the capital account of the concerned partner. 6.The balance of the cash account at the end will be exactly equal to the balance of capital account, provided they are in credit; credit cash, and debit the partners' capital account with the amount payable to them to close their accounts. 6.5.CONSEQUENCES OF INSOLVENCY OF A PARTNER If the capital account of a partner is in debit, after his share of loss or profit has been adjusted therein, the firm will not have sufficient cash or assets to pay off the amounts due to the other partners, until the amount is repaid by the partner whose account is in debit. If however, the partner is insolvent, the amount will not be realized. In such a case, the deficiency may be borne by the solvent partners in their profit-sharing ratio or according to the principle settled in the well-known case of Garner vs. Murray. In the latter case, the deficiency would be borne by the solvent partners in proportion to their capitals and not in the proportion in which they share profits and losses. If a partner goes insolvent then the following are the consequences: 1.The partner adjudicated as insolvent ceases to be a partner on the date on which the order of adjudication is made.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 304}, page_content='2.The firm is dissolved on the date of the order of adjudication unless there is a contract to the contrary. 3.The estate of the insolvent partner is not liable for any act of the firm after the date of the order of adjudication. 4.The firm cannot be held liable for any acts of the insolvent partner after the date of the order of adjudication. 6.6.LOSS ARISING FROM INSOLVENCY OF A PARTNER When a partner is unable to pay his debt due to the firm, he is said to be insolvent and the share of loss is to be borne by other solvent partners following the decision in the English case of Garner vs. Murray. According to this decision, solvent partners have to bear the loss due to insolvency of a partner and have to categorically put that the normal loss on realization of assets to be borne by all partners (including insolvent partner) in the profit-sharing ratio but a loss due to insolvency of a partner has to be borne by the solvent partners in the capital ratio. The determination of capital ratio for this has been explained below. The provisions of the Indian Partnership Act are not contrary to Garner vs. Murray rule. However, if the partnership deed provides for a specific method to be followed in case of insolvency of a partner, the provisions as per the deed should be applied. Capital Ratio on Insolvency •The partners are free to have either fixed or fluctuating capitals in the firm. •If they are maintaining capitals at fixed amounts then all adjustments regarding their share of profits, interest on capitals, drawings, interest on drawings, salary, etc. are done through Current Accounts, which may have debit or credit balances, and insolvency loss is distributed in the ratio of fixed capitals. •But if capitals are not fixed and all transactions relating to drawings, profits, interest, etc., are passed through Capital Accounts then Balance Sheet of the business should not exhibit Current Accounts of the partners and capital ratio will be determined after adjusting all the reserves and accumulated profits to the date of dissolution, all drawings to the date of dissolution, all interest on capitals and drawings to the date of dissolution but before adjusting profit or loss on Realization Account.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 305}, page_content=\"•If some partner is having a debit balance in his Capital Account and is not insolvent then he cannot be called upon to bear the loss on account of the insolvency of other partner. Insolvency of all Partners •When the liabilities of the firm cannot be paid in full out of the firm's assets as well as personal assets of the partners, then all the partners of the firm are said to be insolvent. Under such circumstances, it is better not to transfer the amount of creditors to Realization Account. The balance of the creditors' accounts is transferred to Deficiency Account. •Creditors may be paid the amount available including the amount contributed by the partners. • The unsatisfied portion of the creditor account is transferred to the Capital Accounts of the partners in the profit-sharing ratio. Then Capital Accounts are closed. In doing so first close the Partners' Capital Account which is having the worst position. The last account will be automatically closed. 6.7.PIECEMEAL PAYMENTS Generally, the assets sold upon dissolution of partnership are realized only in small instalments over a period of time. In such circumstances, the choice is either to distribute whatever is collected or to wait till the whole amount is collected. Usually, the first course is adopted. In order to ensure that the distribution of cash among the partners is in proportion to their interest in the partanership concern either of the two methods described below may be followed for determining the order in which the payment should be made. 6.7.1.Maximum Loss Method Each installment realized is considered to be the final payment i.e., outstanding assets and claims are considered worthless and partners' accounts are adjusted on that basis each time when a distribution is made, following either Garner vs. Murray Rule or the profit-sharing ratio rule. 6.7.2.Highest Relative Capital Method According to this method, the partner who has the higher relative capital, that is, whose capital is greater in proportion to his profit-sharing ratio, is first paid off. This method is also called as proportionate capital method. For determining the amount by which the capital of each partner is in excess of his relative capital, partners' capitals are first divided by figures that are in proportion to their profitsharing ratio; the smallest quotient will indicate the basic capital. Having ascertained the partner who has the smallest basic capital,\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 306}, page_content='the amount of capital of other partners proportionate to the profit-sharing ratio of the basic capital is calculated. These may be called as their hypothetical capitals. The amount of hypothetical capital of each partner is then subtracted from the amount of his actual capital; the resultant figure will be the amount of excess capital held by him. By repeating the process once or twice, as may be necessary between the partners having excess capital, the amount by which the capital of each partner is in excess will be ascertained. The partner with the largest excess capital will be paid off first, followed by payment to the other or others who rank next to him until the capitals of partners are reduced to their profit-sharing ratio. The illustration given above is now worked out according to this method. Capital: A: ₹ 15,000 B: ₹ 18,000 C: ₹ 9,000 Profit-sharing ratio: A: 2 B: 2 C: 1 Capital divided by the profit-sharing ratio: A: ₹ 7,500 B: ₹ 9,000 C: ₹ 9,000 Proportionate Capital of B and C, taking A’s capital as the base: A: ₹ 15,000 B: ₹ 15,000 C: ₹ 7,500 Excess of actual over proportionate capital: A: ₹ nil'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 307}, page_content=\"B: ₹ 3,000 C: ₹ 1,500 This indicates that A should not get anything till  is paid to  and  is paid to .

Winding up of a LLP may be initiated by Tribunal if: • The LLP wishes to wind up; • The LLP has less than 2 partners for more than 6 months; • The LLP is unable to pay its debts; • The LLP has not acted in the interest of the sovereignty and the integrity of      India; • The LLP has failed to submit with the statements of accounts and solvency or the LLP annual returns for more than five consecutive financial years with the Registrar; ₹3,000B₹1,500CBC\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 308}, page_content='• The Tribunal thinks that it is Just and Equitable that the LLP should be wound up.

Large amount of money, modern technology, large human contribution etc. is required for it, which is not possible to arrange under partnership or proprietorship. To overcome this difficulty, the concept of 'Company' or 'Corporation' came into existence. While the invention of steam power ignited the human imagination to build big machines for the mass production of goods, the need to separate the management from ownership gave birth to a form of organisation today known as 'company'. Company form of organisation is one of the ingenious creations of human mind, which has enabled the business to carry on its wealth creation activities through optimum utilisation of resources. In course of time, a company structure has become an important institutional form for business enterprise, which has carved out a key place for itself in the field of business operations as well as in the wealth-generating functions of society. 2.MEANING OF COMPANY The word 'Company', in everyday usage, implies an assemblage of persons for social purpose, companionship or fellowship. As a form of organisation, the word 'company' implies a group of people who voluntarily agree to form a company. The word 'company' is derived from the Latin word 'com' i.e. with or together and 'panis' i.e. bread. Originally the word referred to an association of persons or merchant men discussing matters and taking food together. However, in law 'company' is termed as company which is formed and incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013 or an existing company formed and registered under any of the previous company laws. As per this definition of law, there must be group of persons who agree to form a company under the law and once so formed; it\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 310}, page_content='becomes a separate legal entity having perpetual succession with a distinct name of its own and a common seal. Its existence is not affected by the change of members. Company begs its origin in law. It is an organisation consisting of individuals, called shareholders by virtue of holding the shares of a company, who are authorised by law to elect a board of directors and, through it, to act as a separate legal entity as regards its activities. Generally, the capital of the company consists of transferable shares, and members have limited liabilities. To get to the heart of the nature of the company, let us examine the concept of company propounded under corporate jurisprudence. According to Justice Marshal, \"A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible and existing only in the contemplation of law\". In the same manner, Lord Justice Hanay has defined a company as \"an artificial person created by law with a perpetual succession and a common seal\". A common thread running through the various definitions of \\'company\\' is that it is an association of persons created by law as a separate body for a special purpose. At the same time, definitions have laid down certain characteristics of a corporate organisation, which make it out as a separate and unique organisation which enables the people to contribute their wealth to the capital of the company by subscribing to its shares and appointing elected representatives to carry out the business. 3.SALIENT FEATURES OF A COMPANY Following are the salient features of a company: 1.Incorporated Association: A company comes into existence through the operation of law. Therefore, incorporation of company under the Companies Act is must. Without such registration, no company can come into existence. Being created by law, it is regarded as an artificial legal person. 2.Separate Legal Entity: A company has a separate legal entity and is not affected by changes in its membership. Therefore, being a separate business entity, a company can contract, sue and be sued in its incorporated name and capacity. 3.Perpetual Existence: Since company has existence independent of its members, it continues to be in existence despite the death, insolvency or change of members.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 311}, page_content=\"4.Common Seal: Company is not a natural person; therefore, it cannot sign the documents in the manner as a natural person would do. In order to enable the company to sign its documents, it is provided with a legal tool called 'Common Seal'. The common seal is affixed on all documents by the person authorised to do so who in turn puts his signature for and on behalf of the company. Companies Act, 2013 required common seal to be affixed on certain documents (such as bill of exchange, share certificates, etc.) Now, the use of common seal has been made optional. All such documents which required affixing the common seal may now instead be signed by two directors or one director and a company secretary of the company. Further, every company registered in India are required to obtain unique Corporate Identification Number (CIN) that is assigned by Registrar of Companies. 5.Limited Liability: The liability of every shareholder of a company is limited to the amount he has agreed to pay to the company on the shares allotted to him. If such shares are fully paid-up, he is subject to no further liability. 6.Distinction between Ownership and Management: Since the number of shareholders is very large and may be distributed at different geographical locations, it becomes difficult for them to carry on the operational management of the company on a dayto-day basis. This gives rise to the need of separation of the management and ownership. 7.Not a citizen: A company is not a citizen in the same sense as a natural person is, though it is created by the process of law. It has a legal existence but does not enjoy the citizenship rights and duties as are enjoyed by the natural citizens. 8.Transferability of Shares: The capital is contributed by the shareholders through the subscription of shares. Such shares are transferable by its members except in case of a private limited company, which may have certain restrictions on such transferability. 9.Maintenance of Books: A limited company is required by law to keep a prescribed set of account books and any failure in this regard attracts penalties. 10.Periodic Audit: A company has to get its accounts periodically audited through the chartered accountants appointed for the purpose by the shareholders on the recommendation of board of directors. 11.Right of Access to Information: The right of the shareholders of a company to inspect its books of account, with the exception of books open for inspection under the Statute, is governed by the Articles of Association. The shareholders have a right to seek information from the directors by\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 312}, page_content='participating in the meetings of the company and through the periodic reports. 4.TYPES OF COMPANIES 1.Government Company According to Section 2(45) of the Companies Act, 2013, \"Government company\" means any company in which not less than fifty-one per cent of the paid-up share capital is held by the Central Government, or by any State Government or Governments, or partly by the Central Government and partly by one or more State Governments, and includes a company which is a subsidiary company of such a Government company. 2.Foreign Company According to Section 2 (42) of the Companies Act, 2013, \"Foreign company\" means any company or body corporate incorporated outside India which - a)Has a place of business in India whether by itself or through an agent physically or through electronic mode; and b)Conducts any business activity in India in any other manner. 3.Private Company Section 2(68) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines \\'Private company\\' as a company which by its articles, i.Restrict the right to transfer its shares; ii.Except in case of One Person Company limits the number of its members to two hundred: Provided that where two or more persons hold one or more shares in a company jointly, they shall, for the purposes of this sub-clause, be treated as a single member: Provided further that- A.Persons who are in the employment of the company; and B.persons who, having been formerly in the employment of the company, were members of the company while in that employment and have continued to be members after the employment ceased,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 313}, page_content='shall not be included in the number of members; and iii.Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for any securities of the company.

No Minimum Paid-up Share Capital: The minimum paid-up share capital requirement of INR  (in case of a private company) and INR 5,00,000 (in case of a public company) has been done away with under Companies Act, 2013. Accordingly, no minimum paid-up capital requirements will now apply for incorporating private as well as public companies in India. 5.One Person Company Section 2 (62) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines \"One Person Company\" as a company which has only one person as a member. 6.Small Company Section 2(85) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines \"Small company\" means a company, other than a public company i.paid-up share capital of which does not exceed four crores rupees or such higher amount as may be prescribed which shall not be more than ten crore rupees; and ii.turnover of which as per its last profit and loss account for the immediately preceding financial year does not exceed forty crore rupees or such higher amount as may be prescribed which shall not be more than hundred crore rupees: 1,00,000'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 314}, page_content='Provided that nothing in this clause should apply to: A.a holding company or a subsidiary company B.a company registered under section 8 C.a company or body corporate governed by any special Act 7.Listed Company As per Section 2 (52) of the Companies Act, 2013, \"listed company\" means a company which has any of its securities listed on any recognised stock exchange.

Revenue from operations refers to the income generated from the core business activities. Other income consists of earnings from non-primary business activities. Total Revenue is the sum of Revenue from operations and Other income. Expenses include costs related to materials, purchases, changes in inventories, employee benefits, finance, depreciation and amortization, and other miscellaneous expenses. Total expenses are the aggregate of all individual expenses. Profit before exceptional and extraordinary items and tax is calculated by subtracting Total expenses from Total Revenue. Exceptional items are significant charges or credits that arise from events that are not considered part of the ordinary activities of the business. Profit before extraordinary items and tax is the profit calculated after considering Exceptional items.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 324}, page_content='Extraordinary Items are events and transactions that are distinguished by their size or incidence. Profit before tax is the income before accounting for income taxes, which includes both Exceptional and Extraordinary items. Tax expense includes Current tax and Deferred tax charges for the period. Profit (Loss) for the period from continuing operations is the profit or loss after tax expense but before extraordinary items. Profit(Loss) from discontinuing operations is the result of operations that are planned to be discontinued. Tax expense of discontinuing operations represents the tax attributed to the discontinuing operations. Profit(Loss) from discontinuing operations (after tax) is the net result after tax of the discontinuing operations. Profit (Loss) for the period is the net result for the reporting period, including both continuing and discontinuing operations. Earnings per equity share are calculated in two ways: Basic, which is the profit attributable to each equity share, and Diluted, which reflects the impact on earnings if all potential shares that could dilute earnings per share were converted to equity shares. UNIT - 2 ISSUE, FORFEITURE AND RE-ISSUE OF SHARES 2.1.INTRODUCTION Funds provided by the owner(s) into a business are recorded as capital. Capital of the business depends upon the form of business organisation. Proprietor provides capital in a soleproprietorship business. In case of a partnership, there is more than one proprietor, called partners. Partners introduce capital in a partnership firm. As the maximum number of members in a partnership firm is restricted, therefore only limited capital can be provided in such form of businesses. Moreover, the liability of the proprietor(s) is unlimited in case of noncorporate business, namely, sole-proprietorship and partnership. Capital funding process for different types of business forms can be summarised as follows: 1.In a Sole Proprietorship, the business is owned by a single individual, the proprietor, who contributes the capital and has unlimited liability, meaning personal assets can be used to cover business debts.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 325}, page_content=\"2.A Partnership is a business owned by multiple individuals, known as partners, who provide the partners' capital and share unlimited liability for business obligations. 3.A Company is an entity owned by shareholders who contribute share capital; their liability is limited to the amount paid for their shares. With the onset of industrial revolution, requirement of capital investment soared to a new height and the attached risk of failure increased due to pace of technological developments. Non-corporate entities could not cope with the pressure of increased capital and degree of risk involved. This led to the emergence of corporate form of organisation. 2.2.SHARE CAPITAL Total capital of the company is divided into a number of small indivisible units of a fixed amount and each such unit is called a share. The fixed value of a share, printed on the share certificate, is called nominal/par/face value of a share. However, a company can issue shares at a price different from the face value of a share. The liability of holder of shares (called shareholders) is limited to the issue price of shares acquired by them. Note: The issue price need not be equal to market price of the share. These days the shares are generally priced on the basis of book building process. (Book building is a process through which company determines it's share prices. Under this method company determines a price band of its shares and on the basis of bids received from potential investors at various prices within the price band finally fixes its issue price.) The total capital of the company is divided into shares, the capital of the company is called 'Share Capital'. At the time of issue of shares, every Company is required to follow SEBI Regulations. Share capital of a company is divided into following categories: i.Authorised Share Capital or Nominal Capital: A company estimates its maximum capital requirements. This amount of capital is mentioned in 'Capital Clause' of the 'Memorandum of Association' registered with the Registrar of Companies. It puts a limit on the amount of capital, which a company is authorised to raise during its lifetime and is called 'Authorised Capital'. It is shown in the Share Capital schedule in the financial statements as per the prescribed format at face value. ii.Issued Share Capital: A company need not issue total authorised capital. Whatever portion of the share capital is issued by the company, it is called 'Issued Capital'. Issued capital means and includes the nominal value of shares issued by the company for:\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 326}, page_content=\"1.Cash, and 2.Consideration other than cash to: i.Promoters of a company; and ii.Others. It is also presented in the balance sheet at nominal value. The remaining portion of the authorised capital which is not issued either in cash or consideration may be termed as 'Un-issued Capital'. It is not shown in the balance sheet. iii.Subscribed Share Capital: It is that part of the issued share capital, which is subscribed by the public i.e., applied by the public and allotted by the company. It also includes the face value of shares issued by the company for consideration other than cash. iv.Called-up Share Capital: Companies generally receive the issue price of shares in instalments. The portion of the issue price of shares which a company has demanded or called from shareholders is known as 'Called-up Capital' and the balance, which the company has decided to demand in future may be referred to as Uncalled Capital. v.Paid-up Share Capital: It is the portion of called up capital which is paid by the shareholders. Whenever a particular amount is called by the company and the shareholder(s) fails to pay the amount fully or partially, it is known as 'unpaid calls' or 'instalments (or Calls) in Arrears'. Thus, instalments in arrears mean the amount not paid although it has been demanded by the company as payment towards the issue price of shares. To calculate paid-up capital, the amount of instalments in arrears is deducted from called up capital. Call-in-advance is that portion of capital which is yet to be called by the company but has already been paid by shareholder. In the financial statements, called-up and paid-up capital are shown together. vi.Reserve Share Capital: As per Section 65 of the Companies Act, 2013, a Company may decide by passing a resolution that a certain portion of its subscribed uncalled capital shall not be called up except in the event of winding up of the company. Portion of the uncalled capital which a company has decided to call only in case of liquidation of the company is called Reserve Capital. Reserve Capital is different from Capital reserve, Capital reserves are part of 'Reserves and Surplus' and refer to those reserves which are not available for\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 327}, page_content=\"declaration of dividend. Thus, reserve capital which is portion of the uncalled capital to be called up in the event of winding up of the company is entirely different in nature from capital reserve which is created out of capital profits only. 1. Authorised Capital = Issued Capital + Unissued Capital. 2.Subscribed Capital can be equal to or grater than or less than Issued Capital resulting in 3 situations respectively: Fully Subscribed; Over Subscribed and Under Subscribed. 3.Called up Capital  Paid up Capital + Calls in arrears if any - Calls in advance if any. 2.3.TYPES OF SHARES Share issued by a company can be divided into following categories : (i) Preference Shares: According to Section 43 of the Companies Act, 2013 persons holding preference shares, called preference shareholders, are assured of a preferential dividend at a fixed rate during the life of the company. They also carry a preferential right over other shareholders to be paid first in case of winding up of the company. Thus, they enjoy preferential rights in the matter of: a)Payment of dividend, and b)Repayment of capital Generally, holders of these shares do not get voting rights. Companies use this mode of financing as it is cheaper than raising debt. Dividend is generally cumulative in nature and need not be paid every year in case of deficiency of profits. The Companies Act, 2013 prohibits the issue of any preference share which is irredeemable. Preference shares are cumulative and non-participating unless expressly stated otherwise. Types of Preference Shares Preference shares can be of various types, which are as follows : a)Cumulative Preference Shares: A cumulative preference share is one that carries the right to a fixed amount of dividend or dividend at a fixed rate. Such a dividend is payable even out of future profit if current year's profits are insufficient for the purpose. This means that dividend on these shares accumulates unless it is paid in full and, therefore, the shares are called Cumulative Preference Shares. The companies are required to disclose the arrears of fixed cumulative dividends on preference shares separately in the =\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 328}, page_content=\"financial statement. In case, the dividend remains in arrears for a period of not less than two years, holders of such shares will be entitled to take part and vote on every resolution on every matter in the general body meeting of the shareholders. b)Non-cumulative Preference Shares: A non-cumulative preference share carries with it the right to a fixed amount of dividend. In case no dividend is declared in a year due to any reason, the right to receive such dividend for that year expires. It implies that holder of such a share is not entitled to arrears of dividend in future. c)Participating Preference Shares: Notwithstanding the right to a fixed dividend, this category of preference share confers on the holder the right to participate in the surplus profits, if any, after the equity shareholders have been paid dividend at a stipulated rate. Similarly, in the event of winding up of the company, this type of share carries the right to receive a pre-determined proportion of surplus as well once the equity shareholders have been paid off. d)Non-participating Preference Shares: A share on which only a fixed rate of dividend is paid every year, without any accompanying additional rights in profits and in the surplus on winding-up, is called 'Non-participating Preference Shares.' Unless otherwise specified, the preference shares are generally nonparticipating. Redeemable Preference Shares: These are shares that a company may issue on the condition that the company will repay after the fixed period or even earlier at company's discretion. The repayment on these shares is called redemption and is governed by Section 55 of the Companies Act, 2013. e)Non-redeemable Preference Shares: The preference shares, which do not carry with them the arrangement regarding redemption, are called Nonredeemable Preference Shares. According to Section 55, no company limited by shares shall issue irredeemable preference shares or preference shares redeemable after the expiry of 20 years from the date of issue. However, a Company may issue preference shares redeemable after 20 years for such infrastructure projects as may be specified, under the Companies Act, 2013. f)Convertible Preference Shares: These shares give the right to the holder to get them converted into equity shares at their option according to the terms and conditions of their issue. g)Non-convertible Preference Shares: When the holder of a preference share has not been conferred the right to get his holding converted into equity share, it is called Non-convertible Preference Shares. Preference shares are nonconvertible unless otherwise stated.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 329}, page_content=\"Note: Unless mentioned otherwise Preference Shares are Non-Cumulative, Non Participating, Non-Convertible and Redeemable in nature. (ii) Equity Shares: Equity shares are those shares, which are not preference shares. It means that they do not enjoy any preferential rights in the matter of payment of dividend or repayment of capital. The rate of dividend on equity shares is recommended by the Board of Directors and may vary from year to year. Rate of dividend depends upon the dividend policy and the availability of profits after satisfying the rights of preference shareholders. These shares carry voting rights. Companies Act, 2013 permits issue of equity share capital with differential rights as to dividend, voting or otherwise in accordance with prescribed rules. The shares can be issued by a company either 1)for cash or 2)for consideration other than cash. 2.4.ISSUE OF SHARES FOR CASH To issue shares, private companies depend upon 'Private Placement' of shares. Public companies issue a 'Prospectus' and invite general public to subscribe for shares. To discuss accounting treatment, we shall concentrate on public companies who invite general public to subscribe for equity shares. Similar accounting treatment is applicable in other cases. However, for journal entries in case of issue of preference shares, the word 'Equity' is replaced with the word 'Preference'. A public company issues a prospectus inviting general public to subscribe for its shares. On the basis of prospectus, applications are deposited in a scheduled bank by the interested parties along with the amount payable at the time of application, in cash. First instalment paid along with application is called 'Application Money'. As per Section 39 of the Companies Act, 2013. Application money must be at least  of the nominal value of shares. After the closing date of the issue (the last date for filing applications), company decides about allotment of shares in consultation with the SEBI and stock exchange concerned. According to the Companies Act, 2013, a company cannot proceed to allot shares unless minimum subscription is received by the company. Minimum Subscription: A public limited company cannot make any allotment of shares unless the amount of minimum subscription stated in the prospectus has been subscribed and the sum payable as application money for such shares has been paid to and received by the company. The amount of minimum subscription to be disclosed in prospectus by the Board of Directors taking into account the following: a)Preliminary expenses of the company, 5%\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 330}, page_content=\"b)Commission payable on issue of shares, c)Cost of fixed assets purchased or to be purchased, d)Working capital requirements of the company, and e)Any other expenditure for the day to day operation of the business. As per guidelines of the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the minimum subscription to be received in an issue shall not be less than ninety per cent of the offer through offer document [Provided that in the case of an initial public offer, the minimum subscription to be received shall be subject to allotment of minimum number of specified securities, as prescribed by Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957]. If the Company does not receive the minimum subscription of  of the issue, all application moneys received shall be refunded to the applicants forthwith, but not later than: (a) fifteen days of the closure of the issue, in case of a non-underwritten issue; and (b) seventy days of the closure of the issue, in the case of an underwritten issue where minimum subscription including devolvement obligations paid by the underwriters is not received within sixty days of the closure of the issue. The company reserves the right to reject or accept an application fully or partially. Successful applicants become shareholders of the company and are required to pay the second instalment which is known as 'Allotment Money' and unsuccessful applicants get back their money. However, in case of delay in refunding the money, the Company becomes liable to pay interest on the amount of refund. Subsequent instalments, if any, to be called by the company are known as 'Calls'. As per Section 39 of the Companies Act, 2013, application money must be at least  of the face value of shares. However, as per SEBI Regulations, the minimum application moneys to be paid by an applicant along with the application money shall not be less than  of the issue price. According to Section 24 of the Companies Act, 2013 matters related to issue and transfer of securities will be administered by the SEBI and not by the Company Law Board. The issue price of shares is generally received by the company in instalments and these instalments are known as under : First instalment . Application Money Second Instalment .

Whenever a company decides to issue shares to public, it invites applications for subscription by issuing a prospectus. It is not necessary that company receives applications for the number of shares to be issued by it. There are three possibilities: 2.5.1.Full Subscription Issue is fully subscribed if the number of shares offered for subscription and the number of shares actually subscribed by the public are same. To start discussion on accounting treatment for issue of shares, let us assume that the issue is fully subscribed. 2.5.2.Under Subscription (5)'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 333}, page_content='It means the number of shares offered for subscription is more than the number of shares subscribed by the public. In this case, the journal entries as discussed above are passed but with one change i.e., calculation of application, allotment and for that matter, the call money is based on number of shares actually applied and allotted. It must be remembered that shares can be allotted, in this case, only when the minimum subscription is received. 2.5.3.Over Subscription In actual practice, issue of shares is either under or over-subscribed. If an issue is oversubscribed, some applications may be rejected and application money refunded and in respect of others, only a part of the shares applied for may be allotted and the excess amount received can be utilised towards allotment or call money which has fallen due or will soon fall due for payment. The entries are: 1.On refund of application money to applicants to whom shares have not been allotted: Share Application A/c Dr. To Bank Account (Being application money refunded) 2.When only a part of shares applied for are allotted. Share Application A/C Dr. To Share Allotment  (With the application money accepted for allotment) To Share Calls-in-Advance* A/c To Bank A/c (With the amount received in advance) (With any excess amount to be refunded) (Being application money adjusted)  Credited to Share Capital A/c subsequently. (Note: This type of share allotment is termed as Pro-rata allotment and has been discussed in detail in para 2.8) 2.6.SHARES ISSUED AT DISCOUNT Shares are regarded to be issued at a discount, if issue is at an amount less than the nominal or par value of shares. The excess of the nominal value over the issue price represents discount on the issue of shares. For example, when a share of the \\xa0∗\\xa0A/C\\xa0\\n\\xa0∗'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 334}, page_content='nominal value of ₹ 100 is issued at ₹ 98 , it is said to have been issued at a discount of 2 per cent. According to Section 53 of the Companies Act, 2013, a Company cannot issue shares at a discount except in the case of issue of sweat equity shares (issued to employees and directors). Thus, any issue of shares at discount shall be void. 2.7.SHARES ISSUED AT PREMIUM When a company issues its securities at a price more than the face value, it is said to be an issue at a premium. Premium is the excess of issue price over face value of the security. It is quite common for the financially strong, and well-managed companies to issue their shares at a premium, i.e. at an amount more than the nominal or par value of shares. Thus, where a share of the nominal value of ₹ 100 is issued at ₹ 105, it is said to have been issued at a premium of 5 per cent. When the issue is at a premium, the amount of premium may technically be called at any stage of share capital transactions. However, premium is generally called with the amount due on allotment, sometimes with the application of money and rarely with the call money. 2.7.1 Accounting Treatment When shares are issued at a premium, the premium amount is credited to a separate account called \"Securities Premium Account\" because it is not a part of share capital. Rather, it represents a gain of a capital nature to the company. Being a credit balance, Securities premium Account is shown under the heading, \"Reserves and Surplus\". However, \\'Reserves and Surplus\\' is shown as \\'shareholders\\' funds in the Balance Sheet as per Schedule III. According to Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013, Securities Premium Account may be used by the company: a.Towards issue of un-issued shares of the company to be issued to members of the company as fully paid bonus securities. b.To write off preliminary expenses of the company. c.To write off the expenses of, or commission paid, or discount allowed on any of the securities or debentures of the company. d.To provide for premium on the redemption of redeemable preference shares or debentures of the company. e.For the purchase of own shares or other securities.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 335}, page_content=\"Note : It may be noted that certain class of Companies as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, whose financial statements comply with the accounting standards prescribed for them (i.e. those companies to whom Indian Accounting Standards are applicable), can't apply the securities premium account for the purposes (b) and (d) mentioned above.

Bank  Dr. To Share Allotment A/c (Money received including premium consequent upon allotment). 2.8.OVER SUBSCRIPTION AND PRO-RATA ALLOTMENT Over subscription is the application money received for more than the number of shares offered to the public by a company. It usually occurs in the case of good issues and depends on many other factors like investors' confidence in the company, general economic conditions, pricing of the issue etc. When the shares are oversubscribed, the company cannot satisfy all the applicants. It means that a decision is to be made on how the shares are going to be allotted. Shares can be allotted to the applicants by a company in any manner it thinks proper. The company may reject some applicants in full, i.e., no shares are allotted to some applicants and application money is refunded. Usually, multiple applications by the same persons are not considered. Allotment may be given to the rest of the applicants in full, i.e., for the number of shares they have applied for. A third alternative is that a company may allot shares to the applicants on pro-rata basis. 'Pro-rata allotment' means allotment in proportion of shares applied for. For example, a company offers to the public 10,000 shares for subscription. The company receives applications for 12,000 shares. If the shares are to be allotted on pro-rata basis, applicants for 12,000 shares are to be allotted 10,000 shares, i.e., on the  or  ratio. Any applicant who has applied for 6 shares will be allotted 5 shares. Under pro-rata allotment, the excess application money received is adjusted against the amount due on allotment or calls. Surplus money after making adjustment against future calls is returned to the applicants. The applicants are informed about the allotment procedure through an advertisement in leading newspapers. When there is a pro-rata allotment, the total application money paid by an applicant is more than the exact amount due on application. The excess amount A/c\\n12,000:10,0006:5\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 337}, page_content='is treated as an advance against allotment or any other future calls. The net amount due on allotment or any other calls is the difference between the amount due on allotment or any other calls and the excess amount received in application.

This reflects the increase in the company\\'s bank account due to the collection of share calls. 2.Calls-in-Arrears (i.e., Money Received is Less Than Due) If the money received is less than the amount due, \"Calls-in-arrears A/C\" is debited with the entry for Bank A/C. This records the unpaid portion of the share call money as arrears. 3.Calls-in-Advance (i.e., Money of Future Instalments Received Beforehand) When money is received in advance of the scheduled calls, \"Calls-in-advance A/C\" is credited with entry for \"Bank A/C\". This represents the receipt of money before it is actually due according to the instalment schedule.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 338}, page_content=\"Calls-in-Arrears Sometimes shareholders fail to pay the amount due on allotment or calls. The total unpaid amount on one or more instalments is known as Calls-in-Arrears or Unpaid Calls. Such amount represents the uncollected amount of capital from the shareholders; hence, it is shown by way of deduction from 'called-up capital' to arrive at paid-up value of the share capital. For recording 'Calls-in-Arrears', the following journal entry is recorded : Calls-in-Arrears A/c Dr. [Amount of Unpaid Calls] Bank A/c Dr. [Amount received] To Share Allotment A/c To Share Calls A/c [Total allotment money due] [Total Call money due] (Being call money/ allotment money received on .... shares at ₹.... per share.) Calls-in-Advance Some shareholders may sometimes pay a part, or whole, of the amount not yet called up, such amount is known as Calls-in-advance. According to Table F, interest at a rate not exceeding 12 per cent p.a. is to be paid on such advance call money. This amount is credited in Calls-inAdvance Account. The following entry is recorded: Bank A/c Dr. [Call amount received in advance] To Call-in-Advance A/c When calls become actually due, calls-in-advance account is adjusted at the time of the call.

Table F prescribes  and  p.a. as the maximum rates respectively for calls in arrears and those in advance. Interest on Calls in Arrears: It is an obligation of shareholders to remit to the company any due calls which remain unpaid. As stipulated by Table F, the maximum interest rate that can be charged is 10%. The interest accrues from the date the call was due until payment is received. Directors are vested with the discretion to waive this interest in specific cases. Such interest is treated as a nominal account and is recorded in the statement of profit and loss as income. Interest on Calls in Advance: This represents the company's obligation to pay interest to shareholders for call money received before it is due. According to Table F, the prescribed maximum interest rate for such advances is 12%. The interest period commences from the date call money is received until the call is due. Shareholders, however, are not entitled to any dividend on these advances. The interest paid is considered an expense for the company and is accounted for as a nominal account. The book entries to be passed for the adjustment of such interest are much the same as those in case of temporary borrowings or loans raised, the only difference being that debits are raised and credits are given to Sundry Members Account (and not the individual accounts of shareholders) in respect of interest recoverable on calls in arrear or that payable on call received in advance, the corresponding entries being made in the Interest Receivable on Calls in Arrears and Interest Payable on Calls in Advance, respectively.

It is very common that one or more shareholders fail to pay their allotment and/or calls on the due dates. Failure to pay call money results in forfeiture of shares. Forfeiture of shares is the action taken by a company to cancel the shares. The directors are usually empowered by the Articles of Association to forfeit those shares by serving proper notice to the defaulting shareholder(s). When shares are forfeited, the title of such shareholder is extinguished but the amount paid to date is not refunded to him. The shareholder then has no further claim on the company. The power of forfeiture must be exercised strictly having regard to the rules and regulations provided in the Articles of Association and it should be bonafide in the interests of the company. The Articles of a company usually authorise the Directors to forfeit shares of a member on account of non-payment of a call or interest thereon after serving him a prior notice as prescribed by the Articles. Directors also have the right to cancel such forfeiture before the forfeited shares are re-allotted.

We know that shares can be issued at par or at a premium. Accounting entries for forfeiture will vary according to situations. 2.11.1.Forfeiture of Shares which were issued at Par In this case, Share Capital Account will be debited with the called-up value of shares forfeited. Allotment or Calls Account will be credited with the amount due but not paid by the shareholder(s).

But fully paid-up shares may be forfeited for realization of debts of the shareholder if the Articles specifically provide it. 2.12.RE-ISSUE OF FORFEITED SHARES A forfeited share is merely a share available to the company for sale and remains vested in the company for that purpose only. Reissue of forfeited shares is not allotment of shares but only a sale. The share, after forfeiture, in the hands of the company is subject to an obligation to dispose it off. In practice, forfeited shares are disposed off by auction. These shares can be re-issued at any price so long as the total amount received (from the original allottee and the second purchaser) for those shares is not less than the amount in arrear on those shares.

Suppose 120 shares of a nominal value of ₹ 10 have been forfeited upon which ₹ 5 per share was paid up and transferred to Forfeited Share Account. Afterwards, 50 shares are re-issued, ₹ 6 per share being collected to make them fully paid up; ₹ 200 ( 50 shares  ₹ 10- 50 shares  ₹ 6) out of shares forfeited will be credited to Share Capital Account to make up the deficiency on re-issued shares, and ₹ 50 (50 shares  ₹ 5 - ₹ 200) will be transferred to the Capital Reserve Account being the surplus on re-issue of the 50 shares. It would have in the Forfeited shares Account balance equivalent to the amount collected on the remaining 70 forfeited shares i.e. ₹ 350 which will be carried forward till these are re-issued. In the above case, it has been assumed that the amount paid up on all the 120 forfeited shares was ₹ 5 per share. But in practice, shares may be forfeited on which varying amounts are outstanding. For instance, if in the above case 70 xxx'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 345}, page_content=\"shares were forfeited with ₹ 5 paid up thereon and 50 shares with  was paid up thereon then: Share Forfeited Account Balance   Thus if 50 shares with  paid up are re-issued for ₹ 6 per share then Capital Reserve balance will be as follows:  shares  2.13.ISSUE OF SHARES FOR CONSIDERATION OTHER THAN CASH Public limited companies, generally, issue their shares for cash and use such cash to buy the various types of assets needed in the business. Sometimes, however, a company may issue shares in a direct exchange for land, buildings or other assets. Shares may also be issued in payment for services rendered by promoters, lawyers in the formation of the company. These shares should be shown separately under the heading 'Share Capital'. Within specified time of allotment, the company must produce before the Registrar a written contract of sale of service in respect of which shares have been allotted. Under accounting standards, if an asset is acquired, or partly acquired, by the issue of shares or other securities, the acquisition cost is the fair value of the securities issued (which, in appropriate cases, may be indicated by the issue price as determined by statutory authorities). The fair value may not necessarily be equal to the nominal or par value of the securities issued.

But with increasing and evergrowing needs of the corporate expansion and growth, equity source of'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 347}, page_content='financing is not sufficient. Hence corporates turn to debt financing through various means. Issuing debt instruments by offering the same for public subscription is one of the sources of financing the business activities. Debt financing does not only helps in reducing the cost of the capital but also helps in designing appropriate capital structure of the company. Debenture is one of the most commonly used debt instrument issued by the company to raise funds for the business. 3.2.MEANING The most common method of supplementing the capital available to a company is to issue debentures which may either be simple or naked carrying no charge on assets, or mortgage debentures carrying either a fixed or a floating charge on some or all of the assets of the company. A debenture is a bond issued by a company under its seal, acknowledging a debt and containing provisions as regards repayment of the principal and interest. If a charge* has been created on any or on the entire assets of the company, the nature of the charge and the assets charged are described therein. Since the charge is not valid unless registered with the Registrar, and the certificate registering the charge is printed on the bond. It is also customary to create a trusteeship in favour of one or more persons in the case of mortgage debentures. The trustees of debenture holders have all powers of a mortgage of a property and can act in whatever way they think necessary to safeguard the interest of debenture holders. Section 2 (30) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines debentures as \"Debenture\" includes debenture stock, bonds or any other instrument of a company evidencing a debt, whether constituting a charge on the assets of the company or not. Thus, It is clear from definition that debenture may be Secured Debenture or Unsecured Debenture. Note: No company shall issue any debentures carrying any voting rights. 3.3.FEATURES OF DEBENTURES 1.It is a document which evidences a loan made to a company. 2.It is a fixed interest-bearing security where interest falls due on specific dates. 3.Interest is payable at a predetermined fixed rate, regardless of the level of profit. 4.The original sum is repaid at a specified future date or it is converted into shares or other debentures.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 348}, page_content='5.It may or may not create a charge on the assets of a company as security. 6.It can generally be bought or sold through the stock exchange at a price above or below its face value. 3.4.DISTINCTION BETWEEN DEBENTURES AND SHARES Debentures 1.Debenture holders are the creditors of the company. 2.Debenture holders have no voting rights and consequently do not pose any threat to the existing control of the company. 3.Debenture interest is generally paid at a pre-determined fixed rate. It is payable, whether there is any profit or not. Debentures rank ahead of all types of shares for payment of the interest due on them. 4.Interest on debentures are the charges against profits and they are deductible as an expense in determining taxable profit of the company. 5.There are different kinds of debentures, such as Secured/ Unsecured; Redeemable/ Irredeemable; Registered / Bearer; Convertible/ Non-convertible, etc. 6.In the Company’s Balance Sheet, Debentures are shown under “Long Term Borrowings”. 7.Debentures can be converted into other debentures or shares as per the terms of issue of debentures. 8.Debentures cannot be forfeited for non-payment of call moneys. 9.At maturity, debenture holders get back their money as per the terms and conditions of redemption. 10.At the time of liquidation, debenture holders are paid-off before the shareholders. Shares 1.Shareholders are the owners of the company. 2.Shareholders have voting rights and consequently control the total affairs of the company. 3.Dividend on equity shares is paid at a variable rate which is vastly affected by the profits of the company (however, dividend on preference shares is paid at a fixed rate). 4.Dividends are appropriation of profit and these are not deductible in determining taxable profit of the company. 5.There are only two kinds of shares—Equity Shares and Preference Shares.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 349}, page_content='6.In the Company’s Balance Sheet, shares are shown under “Shareholder’s Fund” detailed in ‘Share Capital’ of Notes to Accounts. 7.Shares cannot be converted into other shares in any circumstances. 8.Shares can be forfeited for non-payment of allotment and call moneys. 9.Equity shareholders cannot get back their money before the liquidation of the company (however, preference shareholders can get back their money before liquidation). 10.At the time of liquidation shareholders are paid at last, after paying debenture holders, Trade payable, etc. 3.5.TYPES OF DEBENTURES The following are the types of debentures issued by a company. They can be classified on the basis of: 1.Security a)Secured Debentures: These debentures are secured by a charge upon some or all assets of the company. There are two types of charges: (i) Fixed charge; and (ii) Floating charge. A fixed charge is a mortgage on specific assets. These assets cannot be sold without the consent of the debenture holders. The sale proceeds of these assets are utilized first for repaying debenture holders. A floating charge generally covers all the assets of the company including future one. b)Unsecured or \"Naked\" Debentures: These debentures are not secured by any charge upon any assets. A company merely promises to pay interest on due dates and to repay the amount due on maturity date. These types of debentures are very risky from the view point of investors. 2.Convertibility a)Convertible Debentures: These are debentures which will be converted into equity shares (either at par or premium or discount) after a certain period of time from the date of its issue. These debentures may be fully or partly convertible. In future, these debenture holders get a chance to become the shareholders of the company. b)Non-Convertible Debentures: These are debentures which cannot be converted into shares in future. As per the terms of issue, these debentures are repaid. 3.Permanence'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 350}, page_content='a)Redeemable Debentures: These debentures are repayable as per the terms of issue, for example, after 8 years from the date of issue. b)Irredeemable Debentures: These debentures are not repayable during the life time of the company. These are also called perpetual debentures. These are repaid only at the time of liquidation. 4.Negotiability a)Registered Debentures: These debentures are payable to a registered holder whose name, address and particulars of holding is recorded in the Register of Debenture holders. They are not easily transferable. The provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 are to be complied with for effecting transfer of these debentures. Debenture interest is paid either to the order of registered holder as expressed in the warrant issued by the company or the bearer of the interest coupons. b)Bearer Debentures: These debentures are transferable by delivery. These are negotiable instruments payable to the bearer. No kind of record is kept by the company in respect of the holders of such debentures. Therefore, the interest on it is paid to the holder irrespective of any identity. No transfer deed is required for transfer of such debentures. 5.Priority a)First Mortgage Debentures: These debentures are payable first out of the property charged. b)Second Mortgage Debentures: These debentures are payable after satisfying the first mortgage debentures. 3.6.ISSUE OF DEBENTURES 3.6.1.Accounting entries for issue of redeemable debentures The issue of redeemable debentures can be categorized into the following: 1.Debentures issued at a par and redeemable at par or at a discount; 2.Debentures issued at a discount and redeemable at par or at discount; 3.Debentures issued at premium and redeemable at par or at discount; 4.Debentures issued at par and redeemable at premium; 5.Debentures issued at a discount and redeemable at premium.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 351}, page_content='6.Debentures issued at premium and redeemable at premium. Note: Redemption at a discount may be a rare circumstance in practical life. Journal entries in each of the above cases are discussed below: 1.Debentures issued at par redeemable at par: When debenture are issued at par, the issue price is equal to par value, in this regard the following entries are recorded: a)For receipt of application money : Bank A/c   Dr. To Debenture Application A/c b)For transfer of application money to debentures account : Debenture Application A/c     Dr. To ...% Debenture A/c 3.6.2.Accounting for issue of debentures payable in instalments Just like shares, money payable on debentures may be paid either in full with application or by instalments. Accounting entries will differ to some extent in either case. 3.6.2.1.Debentures Payable in Full on Application Where the amount due on debentures are payable in full on application, it is usual to open a separate Debentures Application Account for each class of debentures, such as  Debentures Application Account or  Debentures Application Account. These accounts record moneys received from the applicants of debentures. If an issue is over-subscribed, these accounts can be used to record the refund of moneys to the unsuccessful applicants. At the time of allotment of debentures, the amount in Debentures Application Account is transferred to the respective Debentures Account. As discussed above, debentures may be issued at par, at a premium, or at a discount. 3.6.2.2.Debentures Issued at Par The debentures which are issued at par are issued at the same price as their nominal value; that is, if a debenture with a nominal value of ₹ 100 is issued at par, the company receives ₹ 100. The accounting entries would be as follows: 10%12%'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 352}, page_content=\"a)When cash is received Bank A/c                              Dr. To Debentures Application A/C (Being money received on.... debentures @₹ ....each) b)When excess money is refunded or adjusted for future calls Debentures Application A/c                        Dr. To Bank A/c (Amount refunded) To Debenture Allotment A/c (Amount adjusted for allotment) (Being excess money...debentures adjusted as per Board's Resolution No....dated.....) c)When the debentures are allotted Debentures Application A/c Dr. To % Debentures A/C (Being the allotment of...debentures of ₹ ....each as per Board's Resolution No....dated....) d)On Allotment money being called Debenture Allotment A/c                   Dr. To % Debentures A/c (Being Allotment Money Called) e)On Allotment money being received Bank A/c Dr. To Debenture Allotment A/C (Being Allotment money received) f)On Debenture Call money being called Debenture Calls A/c Dr. To % Debentures A/C\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 353}, page_content=\"(Being Call money made due) g)On Debenture Call money being called Bank A/c Dr. To Debenture Calls A/c (Being Call money received) 3.6.2.3.Debentures Issued at a Premium A company issues debentures at a premium when the market rate of interest is lower than the debentures interest rate. The debentures, which are issued at a premium, are issued at a higher price than their nominal value; that is, if a debenture with a nominal value of  is issued at  premium, the company receives at  where the investor gets slightly less interest than stated in the debenture. For example,  Debentures of ₹ 100 issued at a premium of . The investor will get ₹12 p.a. for his investment of 110 . Therefore, the effective rate of interest on investment is . The premium on debentures is credited to 'Securities Premium Account' as 'Debentures' are covered in the definition of 'securities' specified in the clause (h) of section 2 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act. Therefore, restriction of utilization of debentures (securities) premium will also be governed by Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013. The accounting entries would be as follows: a)When cash is received Bank A/c                         Dr. [Nominal value plus premium] To Debentures Application A/C (Being money received on....debentures @ ₹ ..... each including premium of ₹ .....) b)When excess money is refunded Debentures Application A/c Dr. To Bank A/c (Being refund of money on....debentures @ ₹ .... each, as per Board's Resolution No.....dated....) ₹10010%₹11012%10%(12/110x100)=10.91%\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 354}, page_content='c)When the debentures are allotted Debentures Application A/c               Dr. To % Debentures A/C To Securities Premium A/c (Being the allotment of....debentures, premium transferred to Securities Premium A/c, as per Board\\'s Resolution No....dated....) 3.6.2.4.Debentures Issued at a Discount The Companies Act does not impose any restriction on the price at which debentures can be issued. Unlike shares, there is no limit for discount on issue of debentures. This is why it is very common for debentures to be issued at a discount. The debentures which are issued at a discount are issued at a lower price than nominal value, that is, if a debenture with a nominal value of ₹100 is issued at  discount, the company receives ₹90 only. The issue of debentures at a discount slightly increases the true rate of interest payable. For example,  Debentures of ₹100 issued at a discount of . The Company will have to pay ₹12 for a loan of ₹90. Therefore, the true rate of interest is . The company issues debentures at a discount when the market rate of interest is higher than the debenture interest rate. Like shares, Debentures Account is credited with the nominal value. The difference between the nominal value of debentures and cash received is transferred to \"Discount on Issue of Debentures Account. In the subsequent years, Discount on Issue of Debentures is written-off proportionately by charging to the Statement of Profit and Loss. It is considered a normal practice to amortize discount on issue of debentures over the period of benefit, i.e., normally 3 to 5 years. However, this cannot go beyond tenure of debentures. The accounting entries would be as follows : a)When Cash is received Bank A/c Dr. [Actual cash received] To Debentures Application A/c (Being money received on....debentures @₹ ......each) b)When excess money is refunded 10%12%10%(12/90×100)=13.33%'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 355}, page_content=\"Debentures Application A/c                    Dr. To Bank A/c (Being excess money on...debentures refunded as per Board's Resolution No.....dated....) c)When the debentures are allotted Debentures Application A/c Dr. [Actual cash received] Discount on Issue of Debentures A/c To% Debentures A/c                  Dr. [Discount on debentures][Nominal value of debentures] (Being the allotment of...debentures of ₹ ....each @ ₹ .....each as per Board's Resolution No.....dated...) In fact, the discount on issue of debentures is considered as incremental interest expense. The true expense (net borrowing cost) for a particular accounting period is, therefore, the total interest payment plus the discount amortised. 3.7.ISSUE OF DEBENTURES AS COLLATERAL SECURITY Collateral security means secondary or supporting security for a loan, which can be realised by the lender in the event of the original loan not being repaid on the due date. Under this arrangement, the borrower agrees that a particular asset or a group of assets will be realized and the proceeds there from will be applied to repay the loan in the event that the amount due, cannot be paid. Sometimes companies issue their own debentures as collateral security for a loan or a fluctuating overdraft. When the loan is repaid on the due date, these debentures are at once released with the main security. In case, the company cannot repay its loan and the interest thereon on the due date, the lender becomes the debenture holder who can exercise all the rights of a debenture holder. In such cases, the holder of such debentures is entitled to interest only on the amount of loan, but not on the debentures. Accounting Entries\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 356}, page_content=\"There are two methods of showing these types of debentures in the accounts of a company. Method 1 Under this method, no entry is made in the books of account of the company at the time of making issue of such debentures. In the 'Notes to Accounts' of Balance Sheet, the fact of the debentures being issued and outstanding is shown by a note under the liability secured. Method 2 Under this method, the following entry is made to record the issue of such debentures: Debentures Suspense Account Dr. To % Debentures Account (Being the issue of...debentures collaterally as per Board's Resolution No.....dated......) The Debentures Suspense Account will appear on the assets side of the Balance Sheet under Other Non- Current Assets and Debentures on the liabilities side of the Balance Sheet. When the loan is repaid, the entry is reversed in order to cancel it. 3.8.ISSUE OF DEBENTURES IN CONSIDERATION OTHER THAN FOR CASH Just like shares, debentures can also be issued for consideration other than for cash, such as for purchase of land, machinery, etc. In this case, the following entries are passed: a)Sundry Assets Account Dr. [Assets taken over] To Sundry Liabilities Account[Liabilities assumed] To Vendors Account [Purchase consideration]   (Being the assets and liabilities taken over) b)Vendors Account   Dr.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 357}, page_content=\"To Debentures Account (Being the issue of....debentures to satisfy purchase consideration) Further it should be noted that these debentures can be issued at par, premium and at discount. In each case the second entry for issue of debentures would be done accordingly. Number of debentures to be issued is calculated as follows:- 1.When debentures are issued at par  2.When debentures are issued at premium  3.When debentures are issued at discount  3.9.TREATMENT OF DISCOUNT/LOSS ON ISSUE OF DEBENTURES The discount on issue of debentures is amortised over a period between the issuance date and redemption date. It should be written-off in the following manner depending upon the terms of redemption: a)If the debentures are redeemable after a certain period of time, say at the end of 5 years, the total amount of discount should be written-off equally throughout the life of the debentures (applying the straight line method). The main advantage of this method is that it spreads the burden of discount equally over the years. b)If the debentures are redeemable at different dates, the total amount of discount should be written-off in the ratio of benefit derived from debenture loan in any particular year (applying the sum of the year's digit method). This method is suitable when debentures are redeemed by unequal instalments. The accounting entries would be as follows : Profit and Loss Account Dr. To Discount on Issue of Debentures Account (Being the amount of discount on issue of debentures written-off) \\xa0No.\\xa0of\\xa0Shares\\xa0=\\xa0Purchase\\xa0Consideration\\xa0\\xa0Par\\xa0Value\\xa0\\xa0No.\\xa0of\\xa0Shares\\xa0=\\xa0Purchase\\xa0Consideration\\xa0\\xa0Par\\xa0Value\\xa0+\\xa0Premium\\xa0\\xa0No.\\xa0of\\xa0Shares\\xa0=\\xa0Purchase\\xa0Consideration\\xa0\\xa0Par\\xa0Value\\xa0−\\xa0Discount\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 358}, page_content=\"Loss on issue of debentures is also a capital loss and should be written off in a similar manner as discount on debentures issued. In the balance sheet both the items (Discount and Loss) are shown as Non-current/current assets depending upon the period for which it has to be written off. 3.10.INTEREST ON DEBENTURES Interest payable on coupon debenture is treated as a charge against the profits of the company. Interest on debenture is paid periodically and is calculated at coupon rate on the nominal value of debentures. The company will pay interest net of tax to the debenture holders because the company is under obligation to deduct tax at source at the rates applicable under tax rules from time to time. The companies will deposit the tax so deducted with income tax authorities.

In other words, no new funds are raised with a bonus issue. While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not increase the net worth of the company. Although the total number of issued shares increases, the ratio of number of shares held by each shareholder remains constant. Bonus issue is also known as 'capitalisation of profits'. Capitalisation of profits refers to the process of converting profits or reserves into paid up capital. A company may capitalise its profits or reserves which otherwise are available for distribution as dividends among the members by issuing fully paid bonus shares to the members. If the subscribed and paid-up capital exceeds the authorised share capital as a result of bonus issue, a resolution shall be passed by the company at its general body meeting for increasing the authorised capital. A return of bonus issue along with a copy of resolution authorising the issue of bonus shares is also required to be filed with the Registrar of Companies. Bonus shares are shares issued at no cost to current shareholders in a company. The allocation of bonus shares is based upon the number of shares that the shareholder already owns. This succinctly describes the nature of bonus shares and the basis for their distribution among existing shareholders. 4.1.2.Provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 Section 63 of the Companies Act, 2013 deals with the issue of bonus shares. According to Sub-section (1) of Section 63, a company may issue fully paid-up bonus shares to its members, in any manner whatsoever, out of- i.its free reserves*;\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 360}, page_content=\"ii.the securities premium account; or iii.the capital redemption reserve account: Provided that no issue of bonus shares shall be made by capitalising reserves created by the revaluation of assets. Sub-section (2) of Section 63 provides that no company shall capitalise its profits or reserves for the purpose of issuing fully paid-up bonus shares under sub-section (1), unless-  a)it is authorised by its articles; b)it has, on the recommendation of the Board, been authorised in the general meeting of the company; c)it has not defaulted in payment of interest or principal in respect of fixed deposits or debt securities issued by it; d)it has not defaulted in respect of the payment of statutory dues of the employees, such as, contribution to provident fund, gratuity and bonus; e)the partly paid-up shares, if any outstanding on the date of allotment, are made fully paid-up. f)it complies with such conditions as may be prescribed. The company which has once announced the decision of its Board recommending a bonus issue, shall not subsequently withdraw the same. Sub-section (3) of the Section also provides that the bonus shares shall not be issued in lieu of dividend. As per Para 39 (i) of Table F under Schedule I to the Companies Act, 2013, a company in general meeting may, upon the recommendation of the Board, resolve- i.a)that it is desirable to capitalise any part of the amount for the time being standing to the credit of any of the company's reserve accounts, or to the credit of the profit and loss account, or otherwise available for distribution; and b)that such sum be accordingly set free for distribution in the specified manner amongst the members who would have been entitled thereto, if distributed by way of dividend and in the same proportions.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 361}, page_content='ii.The sum aforesaid shall not be paid in cash but shall be applied, subject to the provision contained in clause (iii), either in or towards - (a) paying up any amounts for the time being unpaid on any shares held by such members respectively; (b) paying up in full, unissued shares of the company to be allotted and distributed, credited as fully paid-up, to and amongst such members in the proportions aforesaid; partly in the way specified in (a) and partly in that specified in (b) above; A securities premium account and a capital redemption reserve account may only be applied in the paying up of unissued shares to be issued to members of the company as fully paid bonus shares. In other words, securities premium account and capital redemption reserve cannot be applied towards payment of unpaid amount on any shares held by existing shareholders. As per Section 63(2) of the Companies Act, 2013, bonus shares cannot be issued unless party paid-up shares are made fully paid-up. Para 39(ii) of Table F under Schedule I to the Companies Act, 2013 allows use of free reserves for paying up amounts unpaid on shares held by existing shareholders. On a combined reading of both the provisions, it can be said that free reserves may be used for paying up amounts unpaid on shares held by existing shareholders (though securities premium account and capital redemption reserve cannot be used). 4.1.3.Journal Entries A.1.Upon the sanction of an issue of bonus shares Capital Redemption Reserve Account          Dr. Securities Premium Account  Dr. General Reserve Account                                Dr. Profit & Loss Account                                      Dr. To Bonus to Shareholders Account. 2.Upon issue of bonus shares Bonus to Shareholders Account Dr. To Share Capital Account.

Whenever a company intends to issue new shares, the voting and governance rights of the existing shareholders may be diluted, if they are not allowed to preserve them. It may happen because new shareholders may subscribe to the issued share capital. Companies Act, 2013 allows existing shareholders to preserve their position by offering those newly issued shares at the first instance to them. The existing shareholders are given a right to subscribe these shares, if they like. However, if they do not desire to subscribe these shares, they are even given the right to renounce it in favour of someone else (unless the articles of the company prohibits such a right to renounce). The value of a right is calculated as the difference between the cum-right value of a share and the ex-right value of a share. Mathematically, it is expressed as: Value of\\xa0right=Cum-right\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0share−Ex  right\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0shareValue\\xa0of\\xa0right=Cum-right\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0share−Ex- right\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0share This formula is used to determine the value of rights issued by a company to its existing shareholders, allowing them to purchase additional shares usually at a discount. The \"cum-right\" value is the share price before the rights are issued (including the value of the rights), while the \"ex-right\" value is the price of the share after the rights have been issued (excluding the value of the rights). In nutshell, the existing shareholders have a right to subscribe to any fresh issue of shares by the company in proportion to their existing holding for shares. They have an implicit right to renounce this right in favour of anyone else, or even reject it completely. In other words, the existing shareholders have right of first refusal, i.e., the existing shareholders enjoy a right to either subscribe for these shares or sell their rights or reject the offer. Exceptions to the rights of existing equity shareholders Section 62 recognises four situations under which the further shares are to be issued by a company, but they need not be offered to the existing shareholders.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 364}, page_content=\"The shares can be offered, without being offered to the existing shareholders, provided the company has passed a special resolution and shares are offered accordingly. Situation 1 To employees under a scheme of employees' stock option subject to certain specified conditions Situation 2 To any persons, either for cash or for a consideration other than cash, if the price of such shares is determined by the valuation report of a registered valuer subject to certain specified conditions. Situation 3 Sometimes companies borrow money through debentures / loans and give their creditor an option to buy equity shares of a company. An option is a right, but not an obligation, to buy equity shares on a future date (expiry date) at a price agreed in advance (exercise price).

It is a contract specifying the obligation to redeem preference shares within or at the end of a given time period at an agreed price. These shares are issued on the terms that shareholders will at a future date be repaid the amount which they invested in the company (apart from the frequent payments of a specified amount of dividend as return on investment during the tenure of the preference shares). The redemption date is the maturity date, which specifies when repayment is scheduled to take place and is usually printed on the preference share certificate. Through the process of redemption, a company can also adjust its financial structure, for example, by eliminating preference shares and replacing those with other securities if future growth of the company makes such change advantageous. 5.2.PURPOSE OF ISSUING REDEEMABLE PREFERENCE SHARES A company may issue redeemable preference shares because of the following: 1.It is a proper way of raising finance in a dull primary market. 2.A company may face difficulty in raising share capital, as its shares are not traded on the stock exchange. Potential investors who may, hesitate in putting money into shares that cannot easily be sold may be encouraged to invest if the shares are redeemable by the company. 3.The preference shares may be redeemed when there is a surplus of capital and the surplus funds cannot be utilised in the business for profitable use. 4.No dividend is required to be paid, if there is loss or no profit, whereas interest is payable on debentures or loans even in case of loss. In other words, preference dividend declared / paid continues to be regarded as an appropriation of profits (similar treatment is given for equity shares), as against interest on debentures, which is a charge against profits.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 369}, page_content=\"In India, the issue and redemption of preference shares is governed by Section 55 of the Companies Act, 2013. 5.3.PROVISIONS OF THE COMPANIES ACT (SECTION 55) A company limited by shares if so authorised by its Articles, may issue preference shares which at the option of the company, are liable to be redeemed within a period, normally not exceeding 20 years from the date of their issue. It should be noted that: a)no shares can be redeemed except out of divisible or distributable profit, (i.e. out of the profit of the company which would otherwise be available for dividend) or out of proceeds of fresh issue of shares made for the purpose of redemption; b)no such shares can be redeemed unless they are fully paid; c)(i) in case of such class of companies, as may be prescribed and whose financial statement comply with the accounting standards prescribed for such class of companies under Section 133, the premium, if any, payable on redemption shall be provided for out of the profits of the company, before the shares are redeemed: Provided also that premium, if any, payable on redemption of any preference shares issued on or before the commencement of this Act by any such company shall be provided for out of the profits of the company or out of the company's securities premium account, before such shares are redeemed. (ii) in case of other companies (not falling under (i) above), the premium, if any payable on redemption shall be provided for out of the profits of the company or out of the company's securities premium account, before such shares are redeemed. (Refer to the Note given in para 5.4.1 for the basis applied in the Illustrations in this Chapter.) d)where any such shares are proposed to be redeemed out of the profits of the company, there shall, out of the divisible profits, i.e. the profits which would otherwise have been available for dividends, be transferred to a reserve account to be called Capital Redemption Reserve Account, a sum equal to the nominal amount of the shares redeemed; and the provisions of the Act relating to the reduction of the share capital of a company shall, except as provided in the Section, apply as if the Capital Redemption Reserve (CRR) Account were the paid-up share capital of the company. The utilisation of CRR Account is further restricted to issuance of fully paid-up bonus shares only.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 370}, page_content=\"From the legal provision outlined above, it is apparent that on the redemption of redeemable preference shares out of accumulated divisible profits, it will be necessary to transfer to the Capital Redemption Reserve Account an amount equal to the amount repaid on the redemption of preference shares on account of face value less proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the purpose of redemption. The object is that with the repayment of redeemable preference shares, the security for creditors/ bankers, etc. should not be reduced. At times, a part of the preference share capital may be redeemed out of accumulated divisible profits and the balance out of a fresh issue. 5.4.METHODS OF REDEMPTION OF FULLY PAID-UP SHARES Redemption of preference shares means repayment by the company of the obligation on account of shares issued. According to the Companies Act, 2013, preference shares issued by a company must be redeemed within the maximum period (normally 20 years) allowed under the Act. Thus, a company cannot issue irredeemable preference shares. Section 55 of the Companies Act, 2013, deals with provisions relating to redemption of preference shares. It ensures that there is no reduction in shareholders' funds due to redemption and, thus, the interest of outsiders is not affected. For this, it requires that either fresh issue of shares is made, or distributable profits are retained and transferred to 'Capital Redemption Reserve Account'. The rationale behind these provisions is to protect the interest of outsiders to whom the amount is payable before redemption of preference share capital. The interest of outsiders is protected if the nominal value of capital redeemed is substituted, thus, ensuring the same amount of shareholders' fund. •In case of redemption of preference shares out of proceeds of a fresh issue of shares, replacement of capital and tangible assets is obvious. •If redemption is done out of distributable profits, replacement of capital is ensured in an indirect manner by retention of profit by transfer to Capital Redemption Reserve. In this case, the amount which would have otherwise gone to shareholders in the form of dividend is retained in the business and is used for settling the claim of preference shareholders. Thus, there is no additional drain from the net assets of the Company. The transfer of divisible profits to Capital Redemption Reserve makes them nondivisible profits. As Capital Redemption Reserve can be used only for issue of fully paid bonus shares, profits retained in the business ultimately get converted into share capital. Security cover available to outside stakeholders depends upon called-up capital as well as uncalled capital to be demanded by the company as per its requirements. To ensure that the interests of outsiders are not reduced, Section 55 provides for redemption of only fully paidup shares.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 371}, page_content=\"From the above paras, it can be concluded that the 'gap' created in the company's capital by the redemption of redeemable preference shares must be filled in by: a)the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares; or b)the capitalisation of undistributed profits (by creating Capital Redemption Reserve); or c)a combination of (a) and (b) above. 5.4.1.Redemption of Preference Shares by Fresh Issue of Shares One of the methods for redemption of preference shares is to use the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares. A company can issue new shares (equity shares or preference shares) and the proceeds from such new shares can be used for redemption of preference shares. The proceeds from issue of debentures cannot be utilised for the purpose. A problem arises when a fresh issue is made for the purpose of redemption of preference shares, at a premium. The point to ponder is that whether the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares will include the amount of securities premium for the purpose of redemption of preference shares. For securities premium account, Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013 provides that the securities premium account may be applied by the company; a)Towards issue of un-issued shares of the company to be issued to members of the company as fully paid bonus securities b)To write off preliminary expenses of the company c)To write off the expenses of, or commission paid, or discount allowed on any of the securities or debentures of the company d)To provide for premium on the redemption of redeemable preference shares or debentures of the company. e)For the purchase of its own shares or other securities. Note: It may be noted that certain class of Companies whose financial statements comply with the Accounting Standards as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, can't apply the securities premium account for the purposes (b) and (d) mentioned above. Note: All the questions in this chapter have been solved on the basis that the companies referred in the questions are governed by Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 and comply with the Accounting Standards prescribed for\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 372}, page_content='them. Accordingly the balance in securities premium account has not been utilized for the purpose of premium payable on redemption of preference shares. Any other way, except the above prescribed ways, in which securities premium account is utilised will be in contravention of law. Thus, the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares will not include the amount of securities premium for the purpose of redemption of preference shares. Reasons for issue of New Equity Shares A company may prefer issue of new equity shares for the following reasons: a.When the company has come to realise that the capital is needed permanently and it makes more sense to issue Equity Shares in place of Redeemable Preference Shares as Preference Shares carry a fixed rate of dividend. b.When the balance of profit, which would otherwise be available for dividend, is insufficient. c.When the liquidity position of the company is not good enough. Advantages of redemption of preference shares by issue of fresh equity shares Following are the advantages of redemption of preference shares by the issue of fresh equity shares: 1.No cash outflow of money - now or later. 2.New equity shares may be valued at a premium. 3.Shareholders retain their equity interest. Disadvantages of redemption of preference shares by issue of fresh equity shares The disadvantages are: 1)There will be dilution of future earnings; 2)Share-holding in the company is changed if the fresh issue is made to outsiders. In case the fresh issue is made to existing shareholders in proportion to their shareholding (i.e., rights issue), the disadvantage of change in shareholding pattern can be mitigated. 5.4.2.Accounting Entries'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 373}, page_content=\"1.When new shares are issued at par Bank Account Dr. To Share Capital Account (Being the issue of .......shares of ₹......each for the purpose of redemption of preference shares, as per Board's Resolution No...... dated....... ) 2.When new shares are issued at a premium Bank Account Dr. To Share Capital Account To Securities Premium Account (Being the issue of ........shares of ₹......each at a premium of ₹......each for the purpose of redemption of preference shares as per Board's Resolution No..... dated......) 3.When preference shares are redeemed at par Redeemable Preference Share Capital Account  Dr. To Preference Shareholders Account 4.When preference shares are redeemed at a premium Redeemable Preference Share Capital Account Dr. Premium on Redemption of Preference Shares Account Dr. To Preference Shareholders Account 5.When payment is made to preference shareholders Preference Shareholders Account Dr. To Bank Account 6.For adjustment of premium on redemption Profit and Loss Account Dr. To Premium on Redemption of Preference Shares Account 5.4.3.Calculation of Minimum Fresh Issue of Shares Sometimes, examination problem does not specify the number of shares to be issued for the purpose of redemption of preference shares and requires that the minimum number of shares should be issued to ensure that provisions of Section\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 374}, page_content='55 of the Companies Act, 2013, are not violated. This is done in four steps as given below: 1)In such cases, the maximum amount of reserves and surplus available for redemption is ascertained taking into account the balances appearing in the balance sheet before redemption and the additional information provided in the problem. For example, if balance of general reserve in the balance sheet is ₹1,00,000 and additional information provides that the Board of Directors have decided that the balance of general reserve should not be less than  u n d e r  a n y  circumstances, then, the maximum amount of general reserve available for redemption is ₹ 60,000. 2)After ascertaining the maximum amount of reserves and surplus available for redemption, adjustment for premium on redemption payable out of profits is made and then it is compared with the nominal value of shares to be redeemed. By comparison, one gets the minimum proceeds of fresh issue as Section 55 permits redemption either out of proceeds of fresh issue or out of divisible profits. Thus, Minimum Proceeds of Fresh Issue of shares : Nominal value of preference shares to be redeemed - Maximum amount of reserve and surplus available for redemption. 3)After computation of minimum proceeds, the minimum number of shares to be issued are determined by dividing minimum proceeds by the proceeds of one share. This is done as follows: Minimum Number of Shares  Minimum proceeds to comply with Section 55/ face value of one share Proceeds of one share mean the par value of a share issued, if it is issued at par or premium. However, in case of issue of share at a discount, it refers to the discounted value. 4)Minimum number of shares calculated as per (3) above, needs to be adjusted due to various reasons. Firstly, shares fractions cannot be issued. Thus, if minimum number of shares as per (3) above includes a fraction, it must be approximated to the next higher figure to ensure that provisions of Section 55 are not violated. Secondly, if the examination problem states that the proceeds/number of shares should be a multiple of say, 10 or 50 or 100 , then again the next higher multiple should be considered. 5.4.4.Fresh Issue at a Premium and Minimum Fresh Issue ₹40,000\\n='), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 375}, page_content=\"The calculation of minimum number of shares, when fresh issue is at a premium should be handled very carefully Minimum fresh issue cannot be calculated unless one knows the profits available for replacement of preference shares and profit available for replacement cannot be determined unless one knows the portion of profit available for redemption which is required for paying premium on redemption. To tackle this, assume that profits available for redemption is not required for paying premium on redemption of preference shares. In other words, it means that securities premium including premium on fresh issue is comparatively more than premium on redemption. If the above assumption holds good, minimum number of shares can be calculated in a simple manner without use of equation. But, if above condition does not hold good, then an equation is used to determine the minimum number of shares. 5.4.5.Minimum Fresh Issue to Provide Funds for Redemption Besides, ensuring compliance with Section 55, the fresh issue of shares is made to provide funds for making payment to preference shareholders. To calculate minimum number of fresh shares to be issued to provide funds, amount payable to preference shareholders is compared with funds available for redemption and the balance of funds to be raised by fresh issue of shares are calculated. The amount to be raised is divided by the issue price of a share (amount payable by shareholder including premium, if any, on fresh issue) to compute the minimum number of shares to be issued. 5.5.REDEMPTION OF PREFERENCE  SHARES BY CAPITALISATION OF UNDISTRIBUTED DIVISIBLE PROFITS Another method for redemption of preference shares, as per the Companies Act, is to use the distributable profits in place of issuing new shares. When shares are redeemed by utilising distributable profit, an amount equal to the face value of shares redeemed is transferred to Capital Redemption Reserve Account by debiting the distributable profit. In other words, some of the distributable profits are kept aside to ensure that it can never be distributed to shareholders as dividend. Profit or a portion of profit that can be otherwise legally distributed as dividend to the shareholders is known as Divisible or Distributable Profit. In this connection, the provisions of the Companies Act state that 'When any such shares are redeemed otherwise than out of the proceeds of a fresh issue, there shall out of profits which would otherwise have been available for dividend (i.e. out of divisible profits), be transferred to a reserve to be called the Capital Redemption Reserve Account sum equal to the nominal amount of the shares redeemed'.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 376}, page_content='Note: Only Divisible Profits can be used to create Capital Redemption Reserve, Non-Divisible Profits cannot be used for this purpose. 5.5.1.Advantages of redemption of preference shares by capitalisation of undistributed divisible profits The advantages of redemption of preference shares by capitalisation of undistributed divisible profits are: 1.No change in the percentage of equity share-holding of the company; 2.Surplus funds can be used. 5.5.2.Disadvantages of redemption of preference shares by capitalisation of undistributed divisible profits The disadvantage of redemption of preference shares by capitalisation of undistributed profits is that there will be a reduction in liquidity or assets may need to be sold such as investments.

In order to fill in the 'gap' between the face value of shares redeemed and the proceeds of new issue, a transfer should be made from distributable profits (Profit & Loss Account, General Reserve and other Free Reserves) to Capital Redemption Reserve Account. Formula: The term 'proceeds from fresh/new issue' shall be interpreted as: a)Amount credited to Share Capital, in case of issue at par b)Amount credited to Share Capital, in case of issue at premium. Though premium is received which is credited to the Securities Premium A/c, the same shall not be regarded as 'proceeds', because if it were to be treated as such, the transfer of distributable profits to the Capital Redemption Reserve would be lower by the amount of the premium received. c)Amount received (i.e., debited to Cash/Bank), in case of issue at a discount.

The trustees of debenture holders have all powers of a mortgage of a property and can act in whatever manner they think necessary to safeguard the interest of debenture holders. Note: Issue of debentures has already been discussed in detail in unit 3 of Chapter 11. 6.2.REDEMPTION OF DEBENTURES Debentures are usually redeemable i.e. either redeemed in cash or convertible to equity shares after a time period. Redeemable debentures may be redeemed: ➢ after a fixed number of years; or ➢ any time after a certain number of years has elapsed since their issue; or ➢ on giving a specified notice; or ➢by annual drawing. A company may also purchase its debentures, as and when convenient, in the open market. When the debentures are quoted at a discount on the Stock Exchange, it may be profitable for the company to purchase and cancel them. 6.3.DEBENTURE REDEMPTION RESERVE A company issuing debentures may be required to create a debenture redemption reserve account out of the profits available for distribution of dividend and amounts credited to such account cannot be utilised by the company for any other purpose except for redemption of debentures. Such an arrangement would'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 382}, page_content='ensure that the company will have sufficient liquid funds for the redemption of debentures at the time they fall due for payment. An appropriate amount is transferred from profits every year to Debenture Redemption Reserve and its investment is termed as Debenture Redemption Reserve Investment (or Debenture Redemption Fund). In the last year or at the time of redemption of debentures, Debenture Redemption Reserve Investments are encashed and the amount so obtained is used for the redemption of debentures. 6.3.1.Requirement to create Debenture Redemption Reserve Section 71 of the Companies Act 2013 covers the requirement of creating a debenture redemption reserve account. Section 71 states as follows: 1)Where a company issues debentures under this section, it should create a debenture redemption reserve account out of its profits which are available for distribution of dividend every year until such debentures are redeemed. 2)The amounts credited to the debenture redemption reserve should not be utilised by the company for any purpose except for the purpose aforesaid. 3)The company should pay interest and redeem the debentures in accordance with the terms and conditions of their issue. 4)Where a company fails to redeem the debentures on the date of maturity or fails to pay the interest on debentures when they fall due, the Tribunal may, on the application of any or all the holders of debentures or debenture trustee and, after hearing the parties concerned, direct, by order, the company to redeem the debentures forthwith by the payment of principal and interest due thereon. 6.3.2.Balance in Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR) When the company decides to establish the Debenture Redemption Reserve Account, the amount indicated by the Debenture Redemption Reserves tables is credited to the Debenture Redemption Reserve account and debited to profit and loss account. That shows the intention of the company to set aside sum of money to build up a fund for redeeming debentures. Immediately, the company should also purchase outside investments. The entry for the purpose naturally will be to debit Debenture Redemption Reserve Investments and credit Bank.

Information about complex matters that should be included in the financial statements because of its relevance to the economic decision-making needs of users should not be excluded merely on the ground that it may be too difficult for certain users to understand. 2.Relevance: To be useful, information must be relevant to the decision-making needs of users.

Information has the quality of relevance when it influences the economic decisions of users by helping them evaluate past, present or future events or confirming, or correcting, their past evaluations. The predictive and confirmatory roles of information are interrelated. For example, information about the current level and structure of asset holdings has value to users when they endeavour to predict the ability of the enterprise to take advantage of opportunities and its'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='to take advantage of opportunities and its ability to react to adverse situations. The same information plays a confirmatory role in respect of past predictions about, for example, the way in which the enterprise would be structured or the outcome of planned operations. Information about financial position and past performance is frequently used as the basis for predicting future financial position and performance and other matters in which users are directly interested, such as dividend and'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='are directly interested, such as dividend and wage payments, share price movements and the ability of the enterprise to meet its commitments as they fall due. To have predictive value, information need not be in the form of an explicit forecast. The ability to make predictions from financial statements is enhanced, however, by the manner in which information on past transactions and events is displayed. For example, the predictive value of the statement of profit and loss is enhanced if'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='the statement of profit and loss is enhanced if unusual, abnormal and infrequent items of income and expense are separately disclosed.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='3.Reliability: To be useful, information must also be reliable, Information has the quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be depended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. Information may be relevant but so unreliable in nature or representation that its recognition may be potentially misleading. For example, if the validity and amount of a claim for damages under a'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='and amount of a claim for damages under a legal action against the enterprise are highly uncertain, it may be inappropriate for the enterprise to recognise the amount of the claim in the balance sheet, although it may be appropriate to disclose the amount and circumstances of the claim. 4.Comparability: Users must be able to compare the financial statements of an enterprise through time in order to identify trends in its financial position, performance and cash flows.

This is not'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='of that which it purports to portray. This is not due to bias, but rather to inherent difficulties either in identifying the transactions and other events to be measured or in devising and applying measurement and presentation techniques that can convey messages that correspond with those transactions and events.

The term debit'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 76}, page_content='debit and credit and their rules. The term debit and credit have already been explained in para 1.4 of this Unit. Transactions in the journal are recorded on the basis of the rules of debit and credit only. For the purpose of recording, these transactions are classified in three groups: i.Personal transactions. ii.Transactions related to assets and properties. iii.Transactions related to expenses, losses, income and gains. 1.7.1.Classification of Accounts i.Personal Accounts: Personal accounts'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 76}, page_content='Accounts i.Personal Accounts: Personal accounts relate to persons, trade receivables or trade payables. Example would be the account of Ram & Co., a credit customer or the account of Jhaveri & Co., a supplier of goods.

Despite this error, the Trial Balance will still agree because the entries are made on both sides of accounts. 2.Clerical Errors: These are mistakes made by a bookkeeper in the accounting process and are further divided into: a.Errors of Omission: When a transaction is not recorded at all, it is an error of omission.

As a general rule, it is essential to first start the ledger accounts with the opening balances of assets, liabilities and the capital. Afterwards, each book of original entry should be separately dealt with, so as to complete the double entry by posting into the ledger all entries which have not been posted. For example, If only personal accounts have been posted from the Cash Book,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 234}, page_content='accounts have been posted from the Cash Book, debits and credits pertaining to nominal accounts and real accounts that are not posted, should be posted into the'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 235}, page_content='ledger. If there are Discount Columns in the Cash Book, the totals of discounts paid and received should be posted to Discounts Allowed and Discounts Received Accounts respectively, for completing the double entry. Afterwards, the other subsidiary books, i.e., Purchases Day Book, Sales Day Book, Purchase Return Book, Sales Return Book, Bills Receivable and Bills Payable, etc. should be totaled up and their totals posted into the ledger to the debit or credit of the appropriate nominal or real'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 235}, page_content='or credit of the appropriate nominal or real accounts, as the personal aspect of the transactions have been posted already. When an Accountant is engaged in posting the unposted items from the Cash Book and other subsidiary books, he may be confronted with a number of problems. The manner in which some of them may be dealt with is described below: 1)In the Cash Book, there can be several receipt entries which have no connection with the business but which belong to the proprietor, e.g.,'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 235}, page_content=\"but which belong to the proprietor, e.g., interest collected on his private investment, legacies received by him, amount contributed by the proprietor from his private resources, etc. All those amounts should be credited to his capital account. Also the Cash Book may contain entries in respect of payments for proprietor's purchases and his personal expenses. All such items should be taken to his capital account on the debit side as drawings. 2)Amounts belonging to the business after collection\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 235}, page_content='belonging to the business after collection may have been directly utilised for acquiring business assets or for meeting certain expenses instead of being recorded in the Cash Book.

In fact, it will be necessary to credit or debit the proprietor’s capital amount which cannot be adjusted anywhere else. 4)Where the benefit of an item of an expense is received both by the proprietor and business, then it should be allocated between the two on some equitable basis e.g. rent of premises when the proprietor lives in the same premises, should be allocated'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/accounting.pdf', 'page': 235}, page_content='lives in the same premises, should be allocated on the basis of the area occupied by him for residence.

Thus, it is not the agreement alone which creates a partnership. A partnership comes into existence only when partners begin to carry on business in accordance with their agreement.

            "2.MEANING OF ACCOUNTING \n",
            "The Committee on Terminology set up by the American Institute of Certified \n",
            "Public Accountants formulated the following definition of accounting in 1961: \n",
            "\"Accounting is the art of recording, classifying, and summarising in a \n",
            "significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events \n",
            "which are, in part at least, of a financial character, and interpreting \n",
            "the result thereof.\" \n",
            "As per this definition, accounting is simply an art of record keeping. The process \n",
            "of accounting starts by first identifying the events and transactions which are of \n",
            "financial character and then be recorded in the books of account. Continuing with \n",
            "the same example of the telecom company, which needs to capture all \n",
            "transactions (transactions made by the user, raising invoice to the customer, \n",
            "receipt of money, payment towards salaries, marketing etc.). Likewise, the \n",
            "individual running the stationery business, would need to record all business \n",
            "transactions. \n",
            "This recording is done in Journal or subsidiary books, also known as primary \n",
            "books. Every good record keeping system includes suitable classification of \n",
            "transactions and events as well as their summarisation for ready reference. For \n",
            "example, the telecom company performing thousands of transactions on a daily \n",
            "basis, is not expected to publish all those transactions for the users to be able to \n",
            "make a decision. Surely, those transactions need to be summarized appropriately. \n",
            "After the transactions and events are recorded, they are transferred to secondary \n",
            "books, i.e., Ledger. In ledger, transactions and events are classified in terms of \n",
            "income, expense, assets and liabilities according to their characteristics and \n",
            "summarised in profit and loss account and balance sheet. \n",
            "Essentially the transactions and events are to be measured in terms of money. \n",
            "Measurement in terms of money means measuring at the ruling currency of a \n",
            "country, for example, rupee in India, dollar in U.S.A. and like. The transactions \n",
            "and events must have at least in part, financial characteristics. The inauguration \n",
            "of a new branch of a bank is an event without having financial character, while \n",
            "the business disposed of by the branch is an event having financial character. \n",
            "Accounting also interprets the recorded, classified and summarized transactions \n",
            "and events. However, the above-mentioned definition does not reflect the present \n",
            "day accounting function. According to the above definition, accounting ends with \n",

            "Therefore, this requirement of communicating and motivating informed \n",

            "communicating the results thereof to the persons interested in such information. \n",
            "The above definition requires accountants to assume a bigger responsibility than \n",
            "to merely do book-keeping. Accountants need to be ready to provide the \n",
            "information ready for the intended users to be able to make economic decisions. \n",
            "2.1.Procedural aspects of Accounting \n",
            "On the basis of the above definitions, procedure of accounting can be basically \n",
            "divided into two parts: \n",
            "i. Generating financial information and \n",
            "ii. Using the financial information. \n",
            "Generating Financial Information \n",
            "1.\n",
            "Recording - This is the basic function of accounting. All business \n",
            "transactions of a financial character, as evidenced by some documents such as \n",
            "sales bill, pass book, salary slip etc. are recorded in the books of account. \n",
            "Recording is done in a book called \"Journal.\" This book may further be \n",

            "books in chapter 2. \n",
            "2. Classifying - Classification is concerned with the systematic analysis of the \n",
            "recorded data, with a view to group transactions or entries of one nature at \n",
            "one place so as to put information in compact and usable form. The book \n",
            "containing classified information is called \"Ledger\". This book contains on \n",
            "different pages, individual account heads under which, all financial \n",
            "transactions of similar nature are collected. For example, there may be \n",
            "separate account heads for Salaries, Rent, Printing and Stationeries, \n",
            "Advertisement etc. All expenses under these heads, after being recorded in the \n",

            "Students will learn how to prepare ledger books in chapter 2. \n",

            "classified data in a manner useful to the internal as well as the external users \n",
            "of financial statements. This process leads to the preparation of the financial \n",

            "given in the financial statements. The figures given in the financial statements \n",
            "will not help anyone unless they are in a simplified form. For example, all \n",
            "items relating to fixed assets are put at one place while all items relating to \n",
            "current assets are put at another place. It is concerned with the establishment \n",

            "Course. \n",
            "5. Interpreting - This is the final function of accounting. It is concerned with \n",
            "explaining the meaning and significance of the relationship as established by \n",
            "the analysis of accounting data. The recorded financial data is analysed and \n",

            "what is likely to happen under specified conditions. \n",
            "6. Communicating - It is concerned with the transmission of summarised, \n",
            "analysed and interpreted information to the end-users to enable them to \n",
            "make rational decisions. This is done through preparation and distribution of \n",

            "and the balance sheet, additional information in the form of accounting ratios, \n",
            "graphs, diagrams, fund flow statements etc. Students will learn this aspect of \n",
            "financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course. \n",
            "The first two procedural stages of the process of generating financial information \n",
            "along with the preparation of trial balance are covered under book-keeping while \n",
            "the preparation of financial statements and its analysis, interpretation and also \n",

            "the coming topics of this unit. \n",
            "Using the Financial Information \n",
            "There are certain users of accounts. Earlier it was viewed that accounting is \n",
            "meant for the proprietor or owner of the business, but changing social \n",
            "relationships diluted the earlier thinking. Since earlier businesses were simple \n",
            "and not scaled, probably that view could hold true for those. \n",
            "It is now believed that besides the owner or the management of the business \n",
            "enterprise, users of accounts include the investors, employees, lenders, suppliers, \n",
            "customers, government and other agencies and the public at large. For example, \n",

            "the art of presenting information systematically to the users of accounts. \n",
            "Accounting data is more useful if it stresses economic substance rather than \n",
            "technical form. Information is useless and meaningless unless it is relevant and \n",
            "material to a user's decision. The information should also be free of any biases. \n",
            "The users should understand not only the financial results depicted by the \n",
            "accounting figures, but also should be able to assess its reliability and compare it \n",
            "with information about alternative opportunities and the past experience. The \n",
            "owners or the management of the enterprise, commonly known as internal users, \n",
            "use the accounting information in an analytical manner to take the valuable \n",
            "decisions for \n",
            "the business. So the information served to them is presented in a manner \n",

            "which should be kept, and the different heads of account under which various \n",
            "items of income and expenditure should be accumulated, are stated below: \n",
            "a) Distinction between personal and business income:- Since the \n",

            "business and not that of its proprietors, it is essential that all personal income \n",

            "distinction should be made between capital and revenue, both receipts and \n",
            "expenditure. Different types of income and expenditure should be classified \n",

            "estimation or otherwise on the same basis as in the previous year. \n",

            "considered material for evaluating the performance of the business or its \n",
            "financial position, should be disclosed. For example, when the labour charges \n",

Transaction is used to mean \\'a \\nbusiness, performance of an act, an agreement\\' while event is used to mean \\'a \\nhappening, as a consequence of transaction(s), a result.\\' \\n2.MEANING OF ACCOUNTING \\nThe Committee on Terminology set up by the American Institute of Certified \\nPublic Accountants formulated the following definition of accounting in 1961: \\n\"Accounting is the art of recording, classifying, and summarising in a \\nsignificant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events \\nwhich are, in part at least, of a financial character, and interpreting \\nthe result thereof.\" \\nAs per this definition, accounting is simply an art of record keeping. The process \\nof accounting starts by first identifying the events and transactions which are of \\nfinancial character and then be recorded in the books of account.'), Document(page_content='Continuing with \\nthe same example of the telecom company, which needs to capture all \\ntransactions (transactions made by the user, raising invoice to the customer, \\nreceipt of money, payment towards salaries, marketing etc.). Likewise, the \\nindividual running the stationery business, would need to record all business \\ntransactions. This recording is done in Journal or subsidiary books, also known as primary \\nbooks. Every good record keeping system includes suitable classification of \\ntransactions and events as well as their summarisation for ready reference. For \\nexample, the telecom company performing thousands of transactions on a daily \\nbasis, is not expected to publish all those transactions for the users to be able to \\nmake a decision. Surely, those transactions need to be summarized appropriately. After the transactions and events are recorded, they are transferred to secondary \\nbooks, i.e., Ledger. In ledger, transactions and events are classified in terms of \\nincome, expense, assets and liabilities according to their characteristics and \\nsummarised in profit and loss account and balance sheet. Essentially the transactions and events are to be measured in terms of money. Measurement in terms of money means measuring at the ruling currency of a \\ncountry, for example, rupee in India, dollar in U.S.A. and like.'), Document(page_content='The transactions \\nand events must have at least in part, financial characteristics. The inauguration \\nof a new branch of a bank is an event without having financial character, while \\nthe business disposed of by the branch is an event having financial character. Accounting also interprets the recorded, classified and summarized transactions \\nand events.'), Document(page_content='However, the above-mentioned definition does not reflect the present \\nday accounting function. According to the above definition, accounting ends with \\ninterpretation of the results of the financial transactions and events but in the \\nmodern world with the diversification of management and ownership, \\nglobalization of business and society gaining more interest in the functioning of \\nthe enterprises, the importance of communicating the accounting results has \\nincreased. Therefore, this requirement of communicating and motivating informed \\njudgement has also become the part of accounting as defined in the widely \\naccepted definition of accounting, given by the American Accounting Association \\nin 1966 which treated accounting as: \\n\"The process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic \\ninformation to permit informed judgments and decisions by the users \\nof accounts.\" \\nIn 1970, the Accounting Principles Board (APB) of American Institute of Certified \\nPublic Accountants (AICPA) enumerated the functions of accounting as follows: \\n\"The function of accounting is to provide quantitative information, \\nprimarily of financial nature, about economic entities, that is needed \\nto be useful in making economic decisions.\" \\nThus, accounting may be defined as the process of recording, classifying, \\nsummarising, analysing and interpreting the financial transactions and \\ncommunicating the results thereof to the persons interested in such information. The above definition requires accountants to assume a bigger responsibility than \\nto merely do book-keeping.'), Document(page_content='Accountants need to be ready to provide the \\ninformation ready for the intended users to be able to make economic decisions. 2.1.Procedural aspects of Accounting \\nOn the basis of the above definitions, procedure of accounting can be basically \\ndivided into two parts: \\ni. Generating financial information and \\nii.'), Document(page_content='Using the financial information. Generating Financial Information \\n1. Recording - This is the basic function of accounting. All business \\ntransactions of a financial character, as evidenced by some documents such as \\nsales bill, pass book, salary slip etc. are recorded in the books of account. Recording is done in a book called \"Journal.\" This book may further be \\ndivided into several subsidiary books according to the nature and size of the \\nbusiness. Students will learn how to prepare journal and various subsidiary \\nbooks in chapter 2. 2. Classifying - Classification is concerned with the systematic analysis of the \\nrecorded data, with a view to group transactions or entries of one nature at \\none place so as to put information in compact and usable form. The book \\ncontaining classified information is called \"Ledger\". This book contains on \\ndifferent pages, individual account heads under which, all financial \\ntransactions of similar nature are collected. For example, there may be \\nseparate account heads for Salaries, Rent, Printing and Stationeries, \\nAdvertisement etc. All expenses under these heads, after being recorded in the \\nJournal, will be classified under separate heads in the Ledger. This will help in \\nfinding out the total expenditure incurred under each of the above heads. Students will learn how to prepare ledger books in chapter 2.'), Document(page_content=\"3. Summarising - It is concerned with the preparation and presentation of the \\nclassified data in a manner useful to the internal as well as the external users \\nof financial statements. This process leads to the preparation of the financial \\nstatements. 4. Analysing - The term 'Analysis' means methodical classification of the data \\ngiven in the financial statements. The figures given in the financial statements \\nwill not help anyone unless they are in a simplified form.\"), Document(page_content='For example, all \\nitems relating to fixed assets are put at one place while all items relating to \\ncurrent assets are put at another place. It is concerned with the establishment \\nof relationship between the items of the Profit and Loss Account and Balance \\nSheet i.e. it provides the basis for interpretation. Students will learn this \\naspect of financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy \\nCourse. 5. Interpreting - This is the final function of accounting. It is concerned with \\nexplaining the meaning and significance of the relationship as established by \\nthe analysis of accounting data. The recorded financial data is analysed and \\ninterpreted in a manner that will \\nenable the end-users to make a meaningful judgement about the financial \\ncondition and profitability of the business operations. The financial statement \\nshould explain not only what had happened but also why it happened and \\nwhat is likely to happen under specified conditions. 6. Communicating - It is concerned with the transmission of summarised, \\nanalysed and interpreted information to the end-users to enable them to \\nmake rational decisions. This is done through preparation and distribution of \\naccounting reports, which include besides the usual profit and loss account \\nand the balance sheet, additional information in the form of accounting ratios, \\ngraphs, diagrams, fund flow statements etc. Students will learn this aspect of \\nfinancial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course. The first two procedural stages of the process of generating financial information \\nalong with the preparation of trial balance are covered under book-keeping while \\nthe preparation of financial statements and its analysis, interpretation and also \\nits communication to the various users are considered as accounting stages. Students will learn the term book-keeping and its distinction with accounting, in \\nthe coming topics of this unit. Using the Financial Information \\nThere are certain users of accounts. Earlier it was viewed that accounting is \\nmeant for the proprietor or owner of the business, but changing social \\nrelationships diluted the earlier thinking. Since earlier businesses were simple \\nand not scaled, probably that view could hold true for those. It is now believed that besides the owner or the management of the business \\nenterprise, users of accounts include the investors, employees, lenders, suppliers, \\ncustomers, government and other agencies and the public at large. For example, \\nif an airlines company borrows money from a bank, buys oil from oil companies, \\nsells tickets to the customers, has staff to be paid salaries to, all these group of \\npeople and entities are key stakeholders in that airlines business. They would like \\nto know and understand whether the business of the company is going well or \\nthere are challenges for the company to run the business.'), Document(page_content=\"Accounting provides \\nthe art of presenting information systematically to the users of accounts. Accounting data is more useful if it stresses economic substance rather than \\ntechnical form. Information is useless and meaningless unless it is relevant and \\nmaterial to a user's decision. The information should also be free of any biases. The users should understand not only the financial results depicted by the \\naccounting figures, but also should be able to assess its reliability and compare it \\nwith information about alternative opportunities and the past experience. The \\nowners or the management of the enterprise, commonly known as internal users, \\nuse the accounting information in an analytical manner to take the valuable \\ndecisions for \\nthe business. So the information served to them is presented in a manner \\ndifferent to the information presented to the external users. Even the small \\ndetails which can affect the internal working of the business are given in the \\nmanagement report while financial statements presented to the external users \\ncontains key information regarding assets, liabilities and capital which are \\nsummarised in a logical manner that helps them in their respective decision-\\nmaking. 3.EVOLUTION OF ACCOUNTING AS A SOCIAL SCIENCE \\nHistory & Development of Accounting \\nAccounting finds its roots as early as around 4000 BC, where Egyptians used \\nsome form of accounting for their treasuries. The in-charge of treasuries had to \\nsend day wise reports to their superiors known as Wazirs and monthly reports \\nwere sent to kings.\"), Document(page_content=\"Babylonia, known as the city of commerce, used accounting \\nfor business to identify the losses that took place due to frauds and lack of \\nefficiency. Greece used accounting to divide the revenues received among \\ntreasuries, maintaining receipts, payments and balance of government financial \\ntransactions. Romans used memorandum or daybook where in receipts and \\npayments were recorded. (700 B.C to 400 A.D). China used sophisticated form of government accounting as early as 2000 B.C. Accounting practices in India could be traced back to a period where, Kautilya, a \\nminister in Chandragupta's kingdom wrote a book named Arthashasthra, which \\nalso described how accounting records had to be maintained. Luca Pacioli's, a Franciscan friar (merchant class), book Summa de \\nArithmetica, Geometria, Proportion at Proportionality (Review of Arithmetic and \\nGeometric proportions) in Venice (1494) is considered as the first book on double \\nentry bookkeeping. A portion of this book contains knowledge of business and \\nbook-keeping.\"), Document(page_content=\"He used the terms Debit (Dr.) and Credit (Cr.) in his books. These \\nwere the concepts used in Italian terminology. Debit comes from the Italian \\ndebito which comes from the Latin debita and debeo which means owed to the \\nproprietor. Credit comes from the Italian credito which comes from the Latin \\n'credo' which means trust or belief (in the proprietor or owed by the proprietor. In explaining double entry system, Pacioli wrote that 'All entries... have to be \\ndouble entries, that is if you make one creditor, you must make some debtor'. He \\nalso mentioned that a merchant's responsibility is to give glory to God in their \\nenterprises, to be ethical in all business activities and to earn a profit. He \\ndiscussed the details of memorandum, journal, ledger and specialised accounting \\nprocedures. In its oldest form, accounting aided the stewards to discharge their stewardship \\nfunction. The wealthy men employed stewards to manage their property; the \\nstewards in turn rendered an account periodically of their stewardship. This \\n'Stewardship Accounting' was the root of financial accounting system. Although \\ndouble-entry system was followed, 'stewardship accounting' served the purpose \\nof businessmen and wealthy persons at that time. In most of the countries, \\nstewardship accounting was prevalent till the emergence of large-scale \\nenterprises in the form of public limited companies. In the second phase, the idea of financial accounting emerged with the concept of \\njoint stock company and divorce of ownership from the management. To \\nsafeguard the interest of the shareholders and investors, disclosure of financial \\nstatements (mainly, profit and loss account and balance sheet) and other \\naccounting information was moulded by law. Financial statements give periodic \\nperformance report by way of profit and loss account and financial position at the \\nend of the period by way of Balance Sheet. It got the legal status due to changing \\nrelationships between the owners, economic entity and the managers.\"), Document(page_content='With the \\ndemocratisation of society, the relationships between the enterprise on the one \\nhand, the investors, employees, managers and governments on the other, have \\nalso undergone a seachange.'), Document(page_content='Also, the prospective investors and other business \\ncontact groups want to know a lot about the business before entering into \\ntransactions. Thus, financial accounting emerged as an information system to \\nidentify, measure and communicate useful information for informed judgements \\nand decisions by a broad group of users. In the third phase, accounting \\ninformation was generated to aid management decision- making in particular. It \\ncontributed a lot to improve the quality of management decisions. This new \\ndimension of accounting is called Management Accounting and it is the \\ndevelopment of 20th Century only. It is pervasive enough to cover all spheres of \\nmanagement decisions. Lastly, Social Responsibility Accounting is in the formative process, which aims \\nat accounting for the social cost incurred by business as well as the social benefit, \\ncreated by it. It emerges from the growing social awareness about the undesirable \\nby-products of economic activities.'), Document(page_content=\"While earning profit, an enterprise incurs \\nnumerous social costs like pollution, using the resources of society like materials, \\nland, labour etc. To compensate for this social cost, in today's world, an \\nenterprise is expected to generate some social benefits also like employment \\nopportunities, recreation activities, more choice to customers at reasonable price, \\nbetter quality products etc. Therefore, it is demanded that the accounting system \\nshould produce a report measuring the social cost incurred and social benefits \\ngenerated. Social Science study man as a member of society; they concern about social \\nprocesses and the results and consequences of social relationships. The \\nusefulness of accounting to society as a whole is the fundamental criterion to \\ntreat it as a social science. Although individuals may benefit from the availability \\nof accounting information, the accounting system generates information for \\nsocial good. It serves social purpose, it contributes for social progress; also it is \\nbeing adapted to keep pace with social progress. So, accounting is treated as a \\nsocial science. 4.OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING \\nThe objectives of accounting can be given as follows: \\n1. Systematic recording of transactions - Basic objective of accounting is to \\nsystematically record the financial aspects of business transactions, i.e., book-\\nkeeping. These recorded transactions are later on classified and summarized \\nlogically for the preparation of financial statements and for their analysis and \\ninterpretation. 2. Ascertainment of results of above recorded transactions - Accountant \\nprepares profit and loss account to know the results of business operations for \\na particular period of time. If revenue (Sales) exceeds expenses then it is said \\nthat business is running profitably but if expenses exceed revenue, then it can \\nbe said that business is running under loss. The profit and loss account helps \\nthe management and different stakeholders in taking rational decisions. For \\nexample, if business is not proved to be remunerative or profitable, the cause \\nof such a state of affair can be investigated by the management for taking \\nremedial steps.\"), Document(page_content=\"3. Ascertainment of the financial position of the business - A businessman is not \\nonly interested in knowing the results of the business in terms of profits or \\nloss for a particular period but is also anxious to know that what he owes \\n(liability) to the outsiders and what he owns (assets) on a certain date. To \\nknow this, accountant prepares a financial position statement popularly \\nknown as Balance Sheet. The balance sheet is a statement of assets and \\nliabilities of the business at a particular point of time and helps in \\nascertaining the financial health of the business. 4. Providing information to the users for rational decision-making - Accounting \\nas a 'language of business' communicates the financial results of an enterprise \\nto various stakeholders by means of financial statements. Accounting aims to \\nmeet the information needs of the decision-makers and helps them in rational \\ndecision-making.\"), Document(page_content=\"5. To know the solvency position - By preparing the balance sheet, management \\nnot only reveals what is owned and owed by the enterprise, but also it gives \\nthe information regarding concern's ability to meet its liabilities in the short \\nrun (liquidity position) and also in the long-run (solvency position) as and \\nwhen they fall due. An overview of objectives of accounting is depicted  below: \\nObjectives of Accounting \\nAccounting aims to fulfill several key objectives, which are essential for the \\nproper management and financial transparency of a business or organization: \\n1.\"), Document(page_content='Systematic Recording of Transactions: The foundation of accounting is the \\nmethodical recording of all business transactions.'), Document(page_content='This is achieved through \\nthe process of bookkeeping, which utilizes tools such as: \\nJournal: A chronological record of all transactions. Ledger: A set of accounts where transactions are categorized. Trial Balance: A statement that ensures that the sum of debits equals the sum \\nof credits, verifying the mathematical accuracy of the bookkeeping. 2.'), Document(page_content='Ascertainment of Results: Accounting helps in determining the \\noperational outcome of a business over a period, usually in terms of profit or \\nloss. This is done through: \\nManufacturing Account: A statement showing the cost of production. Trading Account: A summary of the trading activities, showing the gross \\nprofit or loss. Profit and Loss Account: An account that details the expenses and revenues, \\nculminating in the net profit or loss. 3.'), Document(page_content=\"Ascertainment of Financial Position: Through accounting, a business can \\ndetermine its financial standing at a specific point in time. This objective is \\nprimarily achieved by preparing: \\nBalance Sheet: A financial statement that lists assets, liabilities, and equity, \\ndepicting the financial position of the business. 4. Communicating Information to Various Users: Accounting serves to \\ncommunicate financial information to a diverse set of users, which is crucial \\nfor decision-making. The information is disseminated through: \\nFinancial Reports: Documents such as income statements, balance sheets, cash \\nflow statements, and equity statements that provide detailed financial \\ninformation to stakeholders. These objectives are integral to the discipline of accounting, ensuring that all \\nfinancial information is recorded accurately, results are clearly ascertained, \\nfinancial positions are transparent, and information is effectively communicated \\nto all relevant stakeholders. 5.FUNCTIONS OF ACCOUNTING \\nThe main functions of accounting are as follows: \\na) Measurement: Accounting measures past performance of the business \\nentity and depicts its current financial position. b) Forecasting: Accounting helps in forecasting future performance and \\nfinancial position of the enterprise using past data and analysing trends. c) Decision-making: Accounting provides relevant information to the users of \\naccounts to aid rational decision-making. d) Comparison & Evaluation: Accounting assesses performance achieved in \\nrelation to targets and discloses information regarding accounting policies \\nand contingent liabilities which play an important role in predicting, \\ncomparing and evaluating the financial results. e) Control: Accounting also identifies weaknesses of the operational system \\nand provides feedbacks regarding effectiveness of measures adopted to check \\nsuch weaknesses. f) Government Regulation and Taxation: Accounting provides necessary \\ninformation to the government to exercise control on the entity as well as in \\ncollection of tax revenues. 6.BOOK-KEEPING \\nBook-keeping is an activity concerned with the recording of financial data \\nrelating to business operations in a significant and orderly manner. It covers \\nprocedural aspects of accounting work and embraces record keeping function. Obviously, book-keeping procedures are governed by the end product, the \\nfinancial statements. The term 'financial statements' means Profit and Loss \\nAccount, Balance Sheet and cash flow statements including Schedules and Notes \\nforming part of Accounts. Book-keeping also requires suitable classification of transactions and events.\"), Document(page_content=\"This \\nis also determined with reference to the requirement of financial statements. A \\nbook-keeper may be responsible for keeping all the records of a business or only \\nof a minor segment, such as position of the customers' accounts in a \\ndepartmental store. Accounting is based on a careful and efficient book-keeping \\nsystem. The essential idea behind maintaining book-keeping records is to show correct \\nposition regarding each head of income and expenditure. A business may \\npurchase goods on credit as well as in cash. When the goods are bought on credit, \\na record must be kept of the person to whom money is owed. The proprietor of \\nthe business may like to know, from time to time, what amount is due on credit \\npurchase and to whom. If proper record is not maintained, it is not possible to get \\ndetails of the transactions in regard to the income and expenses. At the end of the \\naccounting period, the proprietor wants to know how much profit has been \\nearned or loss has been incurred during the course of the period. For this lot of \\ninformation is needed which can be gathered from a proper record of the \\ntransactions. Therefore, in book-keeping, the proper maintenance of books of \\naccount is indispensable for any business. At this level, the major concern of the curriculum is with book-keeping and \\npreparation of financial statements. It seems important to mention at this point \\nthat book-keeping and preparation of financial statements have legal \\nimplications also. Maintenance of books of accounts and the preparation of \\nfinancial statements of a company are guided by the Companies Act, banks and \\ninsurance companies by special Acts governing these institutions and so on. However, for sole-proprietorship and partnership business, there is no specific \\nlegislation regarding maintenance of books of accounts and preparation of \\nfinancial statements. 6.1.Objectives of Book-keeping \\n1. Complete Recording of Transactions - It is concerned with complete and \\npermanent record of all transactions in a systematic and logical manner to \\nshow its financial effect on the business. 2. Ascertainment of financial Effect on the Business - It is concerned with the \\ncombined effect of all the transactions made during the accounting period \\nupon the financial position of the business as a whole. 7.DISTINCTION BETWEEN BOOK-KEEPING AND ACCOUNTING \\nSome people mistake book-keeping and accounting to be synonymous terms, but \\nin fact they are different from each other.\"), Document(page_content=\"Accounting is a broad subject. It calls \\nfor a greater understanding of records obtained from book-keeping and an ability \\nto analyse and interpret the information provided by book-keeping records. Book-keeping is the recording phase while accounting is \\nconcerned with the summarising phase of an accounting system. Book-keeping \\nprovides necessary data for accounting and accounting starts where book-\\nkeeping ends. Book-keeping: This is a process primarily concerned with the systematic \\nrecording of financial transactions. Accounting: This process entails summarizing and interpreting the transactions \\nthat have been recorded during book-keeping. 1. Book-keeping: It lays the foundation for the accounting process. Accounting: It acts as a comprehensive language that communicates the \\nfinancial health and performance of a business. 2. Book-keeping: The creation of financial statements is not a function of \\nbook-keeping. Accounting: Financial statements are generated within this process, utilizing \\nthe initial records from book-keeping. 3. Book-keeping: It does not provide the necessary information for \\nmanagerial decision-making. Accounting: It enables management to make informed decisions based on the \\nanalysis of book-keeping records. 4. Book-keeping: This field does not extend into specialized sub-categories. Accounting: It encompasses various sub-disciplines, such as financial \\naccounting and management accounting. 5. Book-keeping: The financial position of a business cannot be deduced \\nsolely from book-keeping records. Accounting: It allows for the determination of the financial position through \\ndetailed accounting reports derived from book-keeping data. This comparative outline clarifies the distinct roles and contributions of book-\\nkeeping and accounting within the financial recording and reporting processes of \\na business. Relationship of Accounting and Book-keeping can be depicted in the following \\nchart as \\nThe Hierarchy of Financial Recording and Reporting \\nThe field of financial management is structured into distinct yet interrelated \\nlayers, each building upon the foundational practices of the previous one. This \\nhierarchy can be visualized as: \\n1) Accountancy: This is the broadest category within this financial hierarchy. It encompasses all the activities related to the management of financial \\ninformation, including the processes of accounting and bookkeeping, along \\nwith the analytical tasks that inform strategic decision-making. 2) Accounting: Nested within accountancy, accounting refers to the \\nsystematic process of recording, summarizing, and reporting the financial \\ntransactions of a business. It provides a comprehensive view of the financial \\nactivities through the creation of various financial statements and reports. 3) Bookkeeping: At the core of this hierarchy lies bookkeeping, which is a \\nsubset of accounting. It is the initial phase of the accounting process, focusing \\non the meticulous and detailed recording of each financial transaction in \\nchronological order. Bookkeeping is essential for providing the raw financial \\ndata that will be further analyzed and interpreted in the accounting process. In essence, bookkeeping serves as the groundwork for accounting, which in turn \\nis a critical component of the broader discipline of accountancy. Each level in this \\nhierarchy is crucial for the accurate and effective management of a business's \\nfinancial information. 8.SUB-FIELDS OF ACCOUNTING \\nThe various sub-fields of accounting are: \\ni. Financial Accounting - It covers the preparation and interpretation of \\nfinancial statements and communication to the users of accounts. It is \\nhistorical in nature as it records transactions which had already been \\noccurred. The final step of financial accounting is the preparation of Profit \\nand Loss Account and the Balance Sheet. It primarily helps in determination \\nof the net result for an accounting period and the financial position as on the \\ngiven date.\"), Document(page_content='ii. Management Accounting - It is concerned with internal reporting to \\nthe managers of a business unit. To discharge the functions of stewardship, \\nplanning, control and decision- making, the management needs variety of \\ninformation. The different ways of grouping information and preparing \\nreports as desired by managers for discharging their functions are referred to \\nas management accounting. A very important component of the management \\naccounting is cost accounting which deals with cost ascertainment and cost \\ncontrol. Management Accounting will be dealt with at higher levels of the \\nChartered Accountancy Course. iii.Cost Accounting - The terminology of Cost Accounting published by the \\nInstitute of Cost and Management Accountants of England defines cost \\naccounting as: \\n\"the process of accounting for cost which begins with the recording of income \\nand expenditure or the bases on which they are calculated and ends with the \\npreparation of periodical statements and reports for ascertaining and \\ncontrolling costs.\" \\niv. Social Responsibility Accounting - The demand for social \\nresponsibility accounting stems from increasing social awareness about the \\nundesirable by-products of economic activities.'), Document(page_content='As already discussed earlier, \\nsocial responsibility accounting is concerned with accounting for social costs \\nincurred by the enterprise and social benefits created. v. Human Resource Accounting - Human resource accounting is an \\nattempt to identify, quantify and report investments made in human \\nresources of an organisation that are not presently accounted for under \\nconventional accounting practice. 9.USERS OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION \\nGenerally users of accounts are classified into two categories, (a) internal users \\nand (b) external users.'), Document(page_content='Management accounting is concerned with identifying \\ninformation requirements as well as methods of providing such information to \\nmanagement while information requirements of the outside users are generally \\nserved by financial statements. Following are the various users of accounting \\ninformation: \\ni. Investors: They provide risk capital to the business. They need \\ninformation to assess whether to buy, hold or sell their investment. Also they \\nare interested to know the ability of the business to survive, prosper and to \\npay dividend. In non-corporate sector, where ownership and management \\nare not essentially separated, the owners still need information about \\nperformance of the business and its financial position to decide whether to \\ncontinue or shut down. ii. Employees: Growth of the employees is directly related to the growth of \\nthe organisation and therefore, they are interested to know the stability, \\ncontinuity and growth of the enterprise and its ability to provide \\nremuneration, retirement and other benefits and to enhance employment \\nopportunities. iii.Lenders: They are interested to know whether their loan-principal and \\ninterest will be paid back when due. iv. Suppliers and Creditors: They are also interested to know the ability of \\nthe enterprise to pay their dues, that helps them to decide the credit policy \\nfor the relevant concern, rates to be charged and so on. Sometimes, they also \\nbecome interested in long-term continuation of the enterprise if their \\nexistence becomes dependent on the survival of that business.'), Document(page_content=\"v. Customers: Customers are also concerned with the stability and \\nprofitability of the enterprise because their functioning is more or less \\ndependent on the supply of goods, suppose, a company produces some \\nchemicals used by pharmaceutical companies and supplies chemicals on \\nthree month's credit. If all of a sudden it faces some trouble and is unable to \\nsupply the chemical, the customers will also be in trouble.\"), Document(page_content=\"vi. Government and their agencies: They regulate the functioning of \\nbusiness enterprises for public good, allocate scarce resources among \\ncompeting enterprises, control prices, charge excise duties and taxes, and so \\nthey have continued interest in the business enterprise. vii.Public: The public at large is interested in the functioning of the \\nenterprise because it may make a substantial contribution to the local \\neconomy in many ways including the number of people employed and their \\npatronage to local suppliers. viii.Management: Management as whole is also interested in the accounts \\nfor various managerial decisions. On the basis of the accounts, management \\ndetermines the effects of their various decisions on the functioning of the \\norganisation. This helps them to make further managerial decisions. 1.10 RELATIONSHIP OF ACCOUNTING WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES \\nAccounting is closely related with several other disciplines and thus to acquire a \\ngood knowledge in accounting one should be conversant with the relevant \\nportions of such disciplines. In many cases they overlap accounting. The \\naccountant should have a working knowledge of the related disciplines so that he \\ncan understand such overlapping areas and apply the knowledge of other \\ndisciplines in his own work wherever possible, or he can take the expert advice. a) Accounting and Economics: Economics is viewed as a science of \\nrational decisionmaking about the use of scarce resources. It is concerned \\nwith the analysis of efficient use of scarce resources for satisfying human \\nwants. This may be viewed either from the perspective of a single firm or of \\nthe country as a whole. Accounting is viewed as a system, which provides data to the users to permit \\ninformed judgement and decisions. Some non-accounting data are also relevant \\nfor decisionmaking. Accounting overlaps economics in many respects. It contributed a lot in \\nimproving the management decision-making process. But, economic theories \\ninfluenced the development of the decision-making tools used in accounting. However, there exists a wide gulf between economists' and accountants' concepts \\nof income and capital. Accountants got the ideas of value, income and capital \\nmaintenance from economists, but brushed suitably to make them usable in \\npractical circumstances. Accountants developed the valuation, measurement and \\ndecisionmaking techniques which may owe to the economic theorems for origin \\nbut these are moulded in the work environment and suitably tempered with \\nreference to relevance, verifiability, freedom from bias, timeliness, comparability, \\nreliability and understandability. An example may be given to explain the nexus between accounting and \\neconomics. Economists think that value of an asset is the present value of all \\nfuture earnings which can be derived from such assets. Now think about a plant \\nwhose working life is more than one hundred years.\"), Document(page_content=\"How can you estimate future \\nstream of earnings? So accountants developed the workable valuation base - the \\nacquisition cost i.e., the price paid to acquire the assets. At the macro-level, accounting provides the database over which the economic \\ndecision models have been developed; micro-level data arranged by the \\naccounting system is summed up to get macro-level database. Non-overlapping zones of accounting are not negligible. Development of the \\nsystems of recording, classifying and summarising transactions and events, \\nharmonising the systems by uniform rules and communicating the data is \\nessentially a non-overlapping area of accounting. b) Accounting and Statistics: The use of statistics in accounting can be \\nappreciated better in the context of the nature of accounting records. Accounting information is very precise; it is exact to the last paisa. But, for \\ndecision-making purposes such precision is not necessary and hence, the \\nstatistical approximations are sought. In accounts, all values are important individually because they relate to business \\ntransactions. As against this, statistics is concerned with the typical value, \\nbehaviour or trend over a period of time or the degree of variation over a series of \\nobservations. Therefore, wherever a need arises for only broad generalisations or \\nthe average of relationships, statistical methods have to be applied in accounting \\ndata. Further, in accountancy, the classification of assets and liabilities as well as the \\nheads of income and expenditure has been done as per the needs of financial \\nrecording to ascertain financial results of various operations. Other types of \\nclassification like the geographical and historical ones and ad hoc classification \\nare done depending on the purpose to make such classification meaningful. Accounting records generally take a short-term view of events and are confined to \\na year while statistical analysis is more useful if a longer view is taken for the \\npurpose. For example, to fit the trend line a longer period will be required. However, statistical methods do use past accounting records maintained on a \\nconsistent basis. The functional relations showing mathematical relations of one variable with one \\nor more other variables are based on statistical work. These relations are used \\nwidely in making cost or price estimates for some estimated future values \\nassigned to the given independent variables. For example, given the functional \\nrelation of total cost to the price of an input, the effect of changes in future prices \\non the cost of production can be calculated. In accountancy, a number of financial and other ratios are based on statistical \\nmethods, which help in averaging them over a period of time. Several accounting \\nand financial calculations are based on statistical formulae. Statistical methods are helpful in developing accounting data and in their \\ninterpretation. For example, time series and cross-sectional comparison of \\naccounting data is based on statistical techniques. Now- a-days multiple \\ndiscriminate analysis is popularly used to identify symptoms of sickness of a \\nbusiness firm. Therefore, the study and application of statistical methods would \\nadd extra edge to the accounting data. c) Accounting and Mathematics: Double Entry book-keeping can be \\nconverted in algebraic form; in fact the first known book on this subject was \\npart of a treatise on algebra. The fundamental accounting equation will be \\ndiscussed in detail under 'Dual Aspect Concept' of this chapter. Knowledge of arithmetic and algebra is a pre-requisite for accounting \\ncomputations and measurements. Calculations of interest and annuity are the \\nexamples of such fundamental uses. While computing depreciation, finding out \\ninstallments in hirepurchase and instalments payment transactions, calculating \\namount to be set aside for repayment of loan and replacement of assets and \\ncalculating lease rentals, mathematical techniques are frequently used. Accounting data are also presented in ratio form.\"), Document(page_content='With the advent of the computer, mathematics is becoming a vital part of \\naccounting. Instead of writing accounts in traditional fashion, the transactions \\nand events can be recorded in the matrix form and the rules of matrix algebra can \\nbe applied for classifying and summarising data. Now-a-days statistics and econometric models are largely used for developing \\ndecision models for the users of accounts. Also, Operations Research Techniques \\nprovide lot of decision models. Since accounting is meant for providing \\ninformation to the users, to be effective, accounting data should feed the \\ninformation requirements of such statistical, econometric and operations \\nresearch models. Understanding mathematics has become a must to grasp the \\ndecision models framed by statisticians, econometricians and the O.R. experts. Presently graphs and charts are being extensively used for communicating \\naccounting information. In addition to statistical knowledge, knowledge in \\ngeometry and trigonometry seems to be essential to have a better understanding \\nabout the accounting communications system. d) Accounting and Law: An economic entity operates within a legal \\nenvironment. All transactions with suppliers and customers are governed by \\nthe Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act, the Negotiable Instruments Act, etc. The entity itself is created and controlled by laws. For example, a company is \\ncreated by the Companies Act and also controlled by Companies Act. Similarly, every country has a set of economic, fiscal and labour laws. Transactions and events are always guided by laws of the land. Very often the \\naccounting system to be followed has been prescribed by the law. For example, \\nthe Companies Act has prescribed the format of financial statements for \\ncompanies. Banking, insurance and electric supply undertakings may also have to produce \\nfinancial statements as prescribed by the respective legislations controlling such \\nentities. However, legal prescription about the accounting system is the product of \\ndevelopments in accounting knowledge. That is to say, legislation about \\naccounting system cannot be enacted unless there is a corresponding \\ndevelopment in the accounting discipline. In that way accounting influences law \\nand is also influenced by law. e) Accounting and Management: Management is a broad occupational \\nfield, which comprises many functions and encompasses application of many \\ndisciplines including those mentioned above. Accountants are well placed in \\nthe management and play a key role in the management team.'), Document(page_content='A large \\nportion of accounting information is prepared for management decision-\\nmaking. Although management relies on other data sources, accounting data \\nare used as basic source documents. In the management team, an accountant \\nis in a better position to understand and use such data. In other words, since \\nan accountant plays an active role in management, he understands the data \\nrequirements. So the accounting system can be moulded to serve the \\nmanagement purpose. 10.LIMITATIONS OF ACCOUNTING \\nThere are certain misconceptions regarding financial statements. A common man \\npresumes that an income statement shows the correct income or loss of the \\nenterprise and that a balance sheet depicts a perfectly true and fair picture of \\nfinancial standing of that enterprise. It must be recognised that the accounting as \\na language has its own limitations.'), Document(page_content=\"The figures of profit or loss generated by the \\naccounting process are subject to various constraints within which the accounting \\nworks. The assumptions and conventions, on which the accounting is based, \\nbecome the limitations of accounting. The financial statements are never free \\nfrom subjectivity factor as these are largely the outcome of personal judgement of \\nthe accountant with regard to the adoption of the accounting policies. Following \\nare certain instances: \\n1. The factors which may be relevant in assessing the worth of the enterprise \\ndon't find place in the accounts as they cannot be measured in terms of \\nmoney. The Balance sheet cannot reflect the value of certain factors like \\nloyalty and skill of the personnel which may be the most valuable asset of an \\nenterprise these days. 2. Balance Sheet shows the position of the business on the day of its preparation \\nand not on the future date while the users of the accounts are interested in \\nknowing the position of the business in the near future and also in long run \\nand not for the past date. 3.\"), Document(page_content='Accounting ignores changes in some money factors like inflation etc. 4. There are occasion when accounting principles conflict with each other. 5. Certain accounting estimates depend on the sheer personal \\njudgement of the accountant, e.g., provision for doubtful debts, \\nmethod of depreciation adopted, recording certain expenditure \\nas revenue expenditure or capital expenditure, selection of \\nmethod of valuation of inventories and the list is quite long. 6.'), Document(page_content='Financial statements consider those assets which can be \\nexpressed in monetary terms. Human resources although the \\nvery important asset of the enterprise are not shown in the \\nbalance sheet. There is no generally accepted formula for the \\nvaluation of human resources in money terms.'), Document(page_content='7.'), Document(page_content='Different accounting policies for the treatment of same item adds \\nto the probability of manipulations. Though through various laws \\nand Accounting Standards, efforts are made to reduce these \\noptions to minimum but certainly could not be reduced to one. In nutshell, it can be said that the language of accounting has certain \\npractical limitations and, therefore, the financial statements should \\nbe interpreted carefully keeping in mind all various factors \\ninfluencing the true picture. 11.ROLE OF ACCOUNTANT IN THE SOCIETY \\nThere are only a few types of profession in the world which are held in high \\nesteem in public eyes and there is no denying the fact that the accounting \\nprofession is one of them. Goethe had called the accountant’s profession as ‘the \\nfairest invention of the human mind’. At the core of all types of learned \\nprofession, there is the desire of public good and of finding the best way to \\nserve society. By the use of the science of accountancy and under the spell of its \\nart, a dynamic pattern which assists business in planning its future is woven by \\naccountants out of the inert mass of non-speaking silent figures. This is what \\nmakes their profession an instrument of socio-economic change and welfare of \\nthe society. An accountant with his education, training, analytical mind and experience is \\nbest qualified to provide multiple need-based services to the ever growing society. The accountants of today can do full justice not only to matters relating to \\ntaxation, costing, management accounting, financial lay-out, company legislation \\nand procedures but they can delve deep into the fields relating to financial \\npolicies, budgetary policies and even economic principles. The area of activities \\nwhich can be undertaken by the accountants is not limited but it can also cover \\nmany additional facets. 1.12.1 Areas of Service \\nThe practice of accountancy has crossed its usual domain of preparation of \\nfinancial statements, interpretation of such statements and audit thereof. Accountants are presently taking active role in company laws and other corporate \\nlegislation matters, in taxation laws matters (both direct and indirect) and in \\ngeneral management problems. Some of the services rendered by accountants to \\nthe society are briefly mentioned hereunder: \\ni. Maintenance of Books of Accounts: An accountant is able to \\nmaintain a systematic record of financial transactions in order to establish \\nthe net result of the transactions entered into during a period and to state the \\nfinancial position of the concern as at a particular date. For the fulfillment of the twin objective of ascertaining the profit earned or loss \\nsuffered and the financial position, it is necessary that all transactions be \\nrecorded in a systematic manner, which can be done only by an accountant. Proper maintenance of books of accounts assists management in planning, \\ndecision-making, controlling functions. ii. Statutory Audit: Every limited company is required to appoint a \\nchartered accountant or a firm of chartered accountants as their auditor who \\nare statutorily required to report each year whether in their opinion the \\nbalance sheet shows a true and fair view of the state of affairs on the balance \\nsheet date, and the profit and loss account shows a true and fair view of the \\nprofit or loss for the year. Auditing is not confined to the accounts of companies; other organisations may \\nalso have their accounts audited, either because the law so requires (for example, \\nthe Co-operative Societies Act, the Income-tax Act, etc.) or because the \\nproprietors wisely decided so (for example, a partnership firm or an individual \\ntrader). iii.Internal Audit: It is a management tool whereby an internal auditor \\nthoroughly examines the accounting transactions and also the system, \\naccording to which these have been recorded with a view to ensure the \\nmanagement that the accounts are being properly maintained and the system \\ncontains adequate safeguards to check any leakage of revenue or \\nmisappropriation of property or assets and the operations have been carried \\nout in conformity with the plans of management. Now-a-days internal auditing has developed as a service to management. The \\ninternal auditor constructively contributes in improving the operational \\nefficiency of the business through an independent review and appraisal of all \\nbusiness operations.'), Document(page_content='iv. Taxation: An accountant can handle taxation matters of a business or a \\nperson and he can represent that business or person before the tax \\nauthorities and settle the tax liability \\nunder the statute prevailing. He can also assist in avoiding or reducing tax \\nburden by proper planning of tax affairs. Accountants also have a social obligation to express their views on broad tax \\npolicy, on the effect of tax rate on business and the economy in general and on all \\nother aspects of taxation in which they have knowledge superior to that of the \\ngeneral public. v.'), Document(page_content='Management Accounting and Consultancy Services: Management \\naccountant performs an advisory function. He is largely responsible for \\ninternal reporting to the management for planning and controlling current \\noperations, decision-making on special matters and for formulating long-\\nrange plans. His job is to collect, analyse, interpret and present all accounting \\ninformation which is useful to the management. Accountant provides \\nmanagement consultancy services in the areas of management information \\nsystem, expenditure control and evaluation of appraisal techniques for new \\ninvestments and divestments, working capital management, corporate \\nplanning etc. vi. Financial Advice: Many people need help and guidance in planning \\ntheir personal financial affairs. An accountant who knows about finances, \\ntaxation and family problems is well placed to give such advice. Some of the \\nareas in which an accountant can render financial advice are: \\na) Investments: An accountant can explain the significance of the formidable \\ndocuments which shareholders receive from companies and help in making \\ndecisions relating to their investments. b) Insurance: An accountant can provide information to his clients on \\nvarious insurance policies and helps in choosing appropriate policy. c) Business Expansion: As businesses grow in size and complexity and \\nmergers are being considered, accountants are in the forefront in interpreting \\naccounts, making suggestions as to the form of schemes and the fairness of \\nproposals considering cost and financial consequences and generally advising \\ntheir clients. They also advise on how to set about the problem of borrowing \\nmoney or whether this is an appropriate method of finance. Accountants can \\nrender extremely useful service in connection of negotiations with foreign \\ncollaborators. d) Investigations: Financial investigations are required for a variety of \\npurposes. Examples are: \\ni. To ascertain the financial position of a business, for the information of \\ninterested parties in connection with an issue of capital, the purchase or sale \\nof the business or a reconstruction or amalgamation. ii.'), Document(page_content='To help the management to decide whether it is cheaper to manufacture an \\narticle or to buy out. iii. To ascertain why profits have fallen. iv. To achieve greater efficiency in management.'), Document(page_content='v. To ascertain whether fraud has occurred and if so, its nature and extent and \\nto make suggestions which will help to prevent a recurrence. vi. To value businesses and shares in private companies for purposes such as \\npurchase, sale, estate duty or wealth tax etc. For such problems requiring financial investigation, you need an accountant. His \\ntask as an independent professional is to establish the facts fairly and clearly for \\nthe benefit of those who have to make decisions and to give advice in many areas \\nin which he has competence and experience. e) Pension schemes: Specialist advice from actuaries, insurance agents or \\ninsurance company is needed before launching or amending a provident fund \\nor pension scheme in a business. But before making a final decision, an \\naccountant has to be consulted.'), Document(page_content=\"Later on, his help may be needed for \\nmanaging the scheme or obtaining tax relief. vii.Other Services \\na) Secretarial Work: Companies, clubs, and associations indeed, virtually all \\norganisations involve secretarial work. Accountants frequently do this work. b) Share Registration Work: Accountants are often used by many companies \\nto undertake the work involved in registering share transfers and new issues. c) Company Formation: In conjunction with legal advisers, accountants help \\nin the formation of a company or advise against doing so. d) Receiverships, Liquidations, etc.: An accountant has to sometimes take on \\nthe onerous duties of liquidator when a company is being wound up or \\nreceiver when a debenture holder exercises a right to recover a loan on which \\nthe borrower has defaulted. Accountant is just the man for the job. He is also \\njust the man to help you to keep insolvency away if you consult him in time. e) Arbitrations: At times, accountants are invited by parties to act as \\narbitrators in a dispute or settle disputes of various kinds. f) As regards the Cost Accounts: A cost accountant's job is to continuously \\nreport cost data and related information at frequent intervals to the \\nmanagement. (g) Accountant and Information Services: An accountant will be effective in \\nhis role if he supplies the information promptly and in an unambiguous \\nlanguage. He should develop a system by which there is a regular flow of \\ninformation both horizontally and vertically. The information system should be such that comparability of financial statement \\nis possible both business-wise and year-wise so that it benefits both the \\nmanagement and the investors. Dependence on data from the computerised \\ninformation system will put new responsibilities on an accountant but his \\nproduct will command greater attention and respect. 1.12.2 Chartered Accountant in Industry \\nAn accountant, though he is a part of the highest planning team is not a planner \\nin an industry. He works with the functional departments and translates the \\norganisation's aims in terms of financial expectations.\"), Document(page_content='Therefore, he has to make \\na thorough study of the business and of individuals in the functional \\ndepartments, whether they are engineers or salesmen. A qualified accountant will \\nbe able to play an important role in performing important functions of a business \\nrelating to accounting, costing and budgetary control, estimating and treasury. 1.12.3 Chartered Accountant in Public Sector Enterprises \\nBoth in the developed and developing countries, public sector enterprises have \\nbecome a special feature of the national economy. The system of financial and \\nbudgetary control and of accounting, auditing and reporting has, therefore, \\nbecome a matter of interest and concern to the nation, and does not remain \\nconfined merely to a limited number of shareholders. The form of accounting \\nfollowed by these corporations or companies is different from that of ordinary \\ngovernment accounting. It is the duty of the accountants to prepare the accounts \\nand reports of these public corporations in such a way that they enable the \\ngeneral public to know how far the items appearing in the various types of \\nrecords and financial statements justify their existence. 1.12.4 Chartered Accountant in Framing Fiscal Policies \\nAccountants have a positive role to play in the determination of proper fiscal \\npolicies and advancement of trade, commerce and industry. They should develop \\nnew techniques and prepare themselves for new fields of service towards their \\ncommitment to the concept of the public goods and services.'), Document(page_content='A business \\nenterprise can be successful in the commercial sense only if accounting and \\nbusiness knowledge are pooled together. It is a social obligation for both \\naccountants in industry and in practice to disclose greater information regarding \\nthe corporate results. The state of affairs of the economy can be ascertained only \\nwhen such consolidated corporate information is disclosed. 1.12.5 Chartered Accountant and Economic Growth \\nIn the present times accountants should conceive their duties as broadly as the \\nconditions might require and do not restrict them to only literal compliance of \\nthe law. Their aim should be not to allow any individual to gain at the cost of the \\nnation. Accountants have to accept a positive role and do their best to encourage \\nefficiency in individual business units and encourage those social objectives \\nwhich form the main foundation of a welfare state. UNIT - 2  \\n2.'), Document(page_content='ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES AND CONVENTIONS \\nFundamental Accounting Concepts and Conventions \\nAccounting is governed by a set of underlying principles and conventions that \\nensure uniformity, reliability, and comparability of financial statements. These \\ninclude: \\n1.'), Document(page_content='Entity Concept: This principle dictates that the business is treated as a \\nseparate entity from its owners or other businesses, with its own set of \\nfinancial records. 2. Money Measurement Concept: According to this convention, only \\ntransactions that can be measured in monetary terms are recorded in the \\naccounting books. 3. Periodicity Concept: This concept facilitates the division of the continuous \\nlife of an enterprise into periodic intervals, usually a year, to produce \\nfinancial reports. 4. Accrual Concept: This principle states that income and expenses are \\nrecognized when they are earned or incurred, not necessarily when the cash \\nis received or paid. 5. Matching Concept: This concept advises that expenses should be matched \\nwith revenues in the period in which the revenue was earned, leading to an \\naccurate calculation of profit or loss. 6. Going Concern Concept: When preparing financial statements, it is \\nassumed that the business will continue to operate and will not be forced to \\nhalt operations or liquidate assets. 7. Cost Concept: This convention maintains that all assets are recorded in the \\nbooks of accounts at their purchase price, which includes cost of acquisition, \\ntransportation, and installation and not their market price. 8.'), Document(page_content='Realisation Concept: Revenue is recognized at the point when it is earned \\nand is measurable, regardless of when cash is received. 9. Dual Aspect Concept: This fundamental principle of accounting states that \\nevery transaction has a dual effect on the financial position of the business, \\nrepresented by the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s \\nEquity. 10.Conservatism: This convention suggests a degree of caution in the face of \\nuncertainty, typically by recognizing expenses and liabilities as soon as \\npossible when there is uncertainty about the outcome, but only recognizing \\nrevenues and assets when they are assured of being received. 11.Consistency: This principle states that once an accounting method has \\nbeen chosen, it should be used consistently from one period to another to \\nensure comparability of financial statements over time. 12.Materiality: This concept implies that all significant items, the knowledge \\nof which might influence the decision of a user of the financial statements, \\nshould be properly reported. These concepts and conventions form the bedrock of financial accounting, \\nensuring that the financial statements present a true and fair view of the financial \\nperformance and position of the business. 2.1.INTRODUCTION \\nLet us imagine a situation where you are a proprietor and you take copies of your \\nbooks of account to five different accountants. You ask them to prepare the \\nfinancial statements on the basis of the above records and to calculate the profits \\nof the business for the year. After few days, they are ready with the financial \\nstatements and all the five accountants have calculated five different amounts of \\nprofits and that too with very wide variations among them. Guess in such a \\nsituation what impact would it leave on you about accounting profession. To \\navoid this, a generally accepted set of rules have been developed. This generally \\naccepted set of rules provides unity of understanding and unity of approach in \\nthe practice of accounting and also in better preparation and presentation of the \\nfinancial statements. Accounting is a language of the business. Financial statements prepared by the \\naccountant communicate financial information to the various stakeholders for \\ndecision-making purpose. Therefore, it is important that financial statements \\nprepared by different organizations should \\nbe prepared on uniform basis. Also, there should be consistency over a period of \\ntime in the preparation of these financial statements. If every accountant starts \\nfollowing his own norms and notions for accounting of different items, then there \\nwill be an utter confusion. To avoid confusion and to achieve uniformity, accounting process is applied \\nwithin the conceptual framework of \\'Generally Accepted Accounting \\nPrinciples\\'(GAAPs). The term GAAPs is used to describe rules developed for the \\npreparation of the financial statements and are called concepts, conventions, \\npostulates, principles etc. These GAAPs are the backbone of the accounting \\ninformation system, without which the whole system cannot even stand erectly. These principles are the ground rules, which define the parameters and \\nconstraints within which accounting reports are generated. Accounting principles \\nare basic norms and assumptions on which the whole accounting system has \\nbeen developed and established. Accountant also adheres to various accounting \\nstandards issued by the regulatory authority for the standardization of \\naccounting policies to be followed under specific circumstances. These conceptual \\nframeworks, GAAPs and accounting standards are considered as the theory base \\nof accounting. Globally, for achieving the standardization, countries use the \\nframework under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, \\ncountries may apply their respective GAAPs and related conceptual frameworks. For example, in India, companies are required to use AS or Ind-AS frameworks \\nas applicable. 2.2.ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS \\nAccounting concepts define the assumptions on the basis of which financial \\nstatements of a business entity are prepared. Certain concepts are perceived, \\nassumed and accepted in accounting to provide a unifying structure and internal \\nlogic to accounting process. The word concept means idea or notion, which has \\nuniversal application. Financial transactions are interpreted in the light of the \\nconcepts, which govern accounting methods. Concepts are those basic \\nassumptions and conditions, which form the basis upon which the accountancy \\nhas been laid. Unlike physical science, accounting concepts are only result of \\nbroad consensus. These accounting concepts lay the foundation on the basis of \\nwhich the accounting principles are formulated. 2.3.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\\t\\n \\n\"Accounting principles are a body of doctrines commonly associated with the \\ntheory and procedures of accounting serving as an explanation of current \\npractices and as a guide for selection of conventions or procedures where \\nalternatives exist.\" \\nAccounting principles must satisfy the following conditions: \\n1. They should be based on real assumptions; \\n2.'), Document(page_content='They must be simple, understandable and explanatory; \\n3. They must be followed consistently; \\n4. They should be able to reflect future predictions; \\n5.'), Document(page_content=\"They should be informational for the users. 2.4.ACCOUNTING CONVENTIONS \\nAccounting conventions emerge out of accounting practices, commonly known as \\naccounting principles, adopted by various organizations over a period of time. These conventions are derived by usage and practice. The accountancy bodies of \\nthe world may change any of the convention to improve the quality of accounting \\ninformation. Accounting conventions need not have universal application. In the study material, the terms 'accounting concepts', 'accounting principles' and \\n'accounting conventions' have been used interchangeably to mean those basic \\npoints of agreement on which financial accounting theory and practice are \\nfounded. 2.5.CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES AND CONVENTIONS - AN OVERVIEW \\nNow we shall study in detail the various accounting concepts on which \\naccounting is based. The following are the widely accepted accounting concepts: \\na) Entity concept: Entity concept states that business enterprise is a \\nseparate identity apart from its owner. Accountants should treat a business as \\ndistinct from its owner. Business transactions are recorded in the business \\nbooks of accounts and owner's transactions in his personal books of accounts. The practice of distinguishing the affairs of the business from the personal \\naffairs of the owners originated only in the early days of the doubleentry \\nbook-keeping. This concept helps in keeping business affairs free from the \\ninfluence of the personal affairs of the owner. This basic concept is applied to \\nall the organizations whether sole proprietorship or partnership or corporate \\nentities. Entity concept keeps the business separate from its owner. In a way, the entity \\nconcept helps to ascertain how much amount of money is due to the owner in \\nform of his capital and share of profits earned. It also helps to perform \\naccounting from the point of view of the business and not that of the owner. For \\nexample, if a person runs a business and pays money from his own pocket for his \\nson's school fee, it will not constitute a transaction in the books of the business. However, if the person withdraws \\nmoney from the business to pay for his son's school fee it will constitute a \\ntransaction to be recorded in the books of the business as amount withdrawn by \\nthe owner. Entity concept means that the enterprise is liable to the owner for capital \\ninvestment made by the owner. Since the owner invested capital, which is also \\ncalled risk capital, he has claim on the profit of the enterprise. A portion of profit \\nwhich is apportioned to the owner and is immediately payable becomes current \\nliability in the case of corporate entities. b) Money measurement concept: As per this concept, only those \\ntransactions, which can be measuredin terms of money are recorded. Since \\nmoney is the medium of exchange and the standard of economic value, this \\nconcept requires that those transactions alone that are capable of being \\nmeasured in terms of money be only to be recorded in the books of accounts. Transactions, even if, they affect the results of the business materially, are \\nnot recorded if they are not convertible in monetary terms. For example, a business owning a factory on a piece of 1 acre of land, with an \\noffice building with 2 floors, having 20 computers, and 10 units of machine \\ncannot show these items under different measurement units. These items need to \\nbe expressed in monetary terms. The factory price might be \\n, cost of land \\nmight be \\n, building \\nwith a cost of \\n, computers at a cost of 10 lac and machines with a cost of \\n need to be recorded. However, the concept has its own limitations.\"), Document(page_content='Transactions and events that \\ncannot be expressed in terms of money are not recorded in the business books. For example; employees of the organization are, no doubt, the assets of the \\norganizations but their measurement in monetary terms is not possible therefore, \\nnot included in the books of account of the organization. Measuring unit for \\nmoney is taken as the currency of the ruling country i.e., the ruling currency of a \\ncountry provides a common denomination for the value of material objects. It may be mentioned that when transactions occur across the boundary of a \\ncountry, one may see many currencies.'), Document(page_content='Suppose a businessman sells goods worth \\n₹ 50 lakhs at home and he also sells goods worth of 1 lakh Euro in the United \\nStates. What is his total sales? ₹ 50 lakhs plus 1 lakh Euro.'), Document(page_content='These are not amenable to even arithmetic treatment. So, transactions are to be \\nrecorded at uniform monetary unit i.e. in one currency.'), Document(page_content='Suppose EURO 1 = ₹ 71 . 50Cr\\n30Cr\\n15Cr\\n10Cr\\nTotal Sales \\n lakhs plus 71 lakhs \\n lakhs. Money Measurement \\nConcept imparts the essential flexibility for measurement and interpretation of \\naccounting data.'), Document(page_content='This concept ignores that money is an inelastic yardstick for measurement as it is \\nbased on the implicit assumption that purchasing power of the money is not of \\nsufficient importance as to require adjustment. For example, a unit of land \\npurchased 10 years ago for \\n and a similar unit of land purchased now for \\n will still be shown at the respective values, i.e., total of \\n. Though in \\nreal world, the true value of the units together might be \\n.'), Document(page_content=\"Accordingly, accounting does not give a true and fair view of the affairs of the \\nbusiness. As mentioned earlier, many material transactions and events are not recorded in \\nthe books of accounts just because they cannot be measured in monetary terms. Yet it is used for accounting purposes because it is not possible to adopt a better \\nmeasurement scale. Entity and money measurement are viewed as the basic concepts on which other \\nprocedural concepts hinge. c) Periodicity concept: This is also called the concept of definite \\naccounting period. As per going concern' concept an indefinite life of the \\nentity is assumed. For a business entity it causes inconvenience to measure \\nperformance achieved by the entity in the ordinary course of business. If a textile mill lasts for 100 years, it is not desirable to measure its performance \\nas well as financial position only at the end of its life. So, a small but workable fraction of time is chosen out of infinite life cycle of the \\nbusiness entity for measuring performance and looking at the financial position. Generally, one year period is taken up for performance measurement and \\nappraisal of financial position. However, it may also be 6 months or 9 months or \\n15 months. According to this concept accounts should be prepared after every period & not at \\nthe end of the life of the entity. Usually, this period is one calendar year.\"), Document(page_content=\"We \\ngenerally follow from 1st April of a year to 31st March of the immediately \\nfollowing year. Thus, for performance appraisal it is not necessary to look into the revenue and \\nexpenses of an unduly long time-frame. This concept makes the accounting \\nsystem workable and the term 'accrual' meaningful. If one thinks of indefinite \\ntime-frame, nothing will accrue. There cannot be unpaid expenses and non- \\nreceipt of revenue. Accrued expenses or accrued revenue is only with reference to \\na finite time-frame which is called accounting period. = ₹50\\n= ₹121\\n40Cr\\n90Cr\\n130Cr\\n180Cr(90 + 90)\\nThus, the periodicity concept facilitates in: \\ni. Comparing of financial statements of different periods \\nii. Uniform and consistent accounting treatment for ascertaining the profit \\nand assets of the business \\niii.Matching periodic revenues with expenses for getting correct results of the \\nbusiness operations \\nd) Accrual concept: Under accrual concept, the effects of transactions and \\nother events are recognised on mercantile basis i.e., when they occur (and not \\nas cash or a cash equivalent is received or paid) and they are recorded in the \\naccounting records and reported in the financial statements of the periods to \\nwhich they relate. Financial statements prepared on the accrual basis inform \\nusers not only of past events involving the payment and receipt of cash but \\nalso of obligations to pay cash in the future and of resources that represent \\ncash to be received in the future. To understand accrual assumption knowledge of revenues and expenses is \\nrequired. Revenue is the gross inflow of cash, receivables and other consideration \\narising in the course of the ordinary activities of an enterprise from sale of goods, \\nfrom rendering services and from the use by others of enterprise's resources \\nyielding interest, royalties and dividends. For example, (1) Mr.\"), Document(page_content='X started a cloth \\nmerchandising. He invested \\n, bought merchandise worth ₹ 50,000 . He \\nsold such merchandise for ₹ 60,000 . Customers paid him ₹ 50,000 cash and \\nassure him to pay ₹ 10,000 shortly. His revenue \\nis ₹ 60,000 . It arose in the ordinary course of cloth business; Mr. X received ₹ \\n50,000 in cash and \\n by way of receivables. Take another example; (2) an electricity supply undertaking supplies electricity \\nspending ₹ \\n for fuel and wages and collects electricity bill in one month \\n by way of electricity charges. This is also revenue which arose from \\nrendering services.'), Document(page_content=\"Lastly, (3) Mr. A invested ₹ \\n in a business. He purchased a machine \\npaying ₹ \\n. He rented it for ₹ 20,000 annually to Mr. B. ₹ 20,000 is the \\nrevenue of Mr. A; it arose from the use PG the enterprise's resources. Expense is a cost relating to the operations of an accounting period or to the \\nrevenue earned during the period or the benefits of which do not extend beyond \\nthat period. In the first example, Mr. X spent ₹ 50,000 to buy the merchandise; it is the \\nexpense of generating revenue of \\n. In the second instance \\n are \\nthe expenses. Also whenever any asset is used it has a finite life to generate \\nbenefit.

Then \\n is the expense every year relating to the cost of \\nmachinery. Accrual means recognition of revenue and costs as they are earned or incurred \\nand not as money is received or paid.

The valuation of assets of a business entity is dependent on this assumption.'), Document(page_content='Traditionally, accountants follow historical cost in majority of the cases.'), Document(page_content='Suppose Mr.'), Document(page_content='X purchased a machine for his business paying \\n out of \\n invested by him. He also paid transportation expenses and installation \\n₹5,00, 000\\n₹7,00, 000\\ncharges amounting to \\n. If he is still willing to continue the business, his \\nfinancial position will be as follows: \\nBALANCE SHEET \\nThis balance sheet shows that the entity has a total of ₹7,00,000 in capital, which \\nmatches the total value of assets. The assets are composed of machinery worth \\n₹5,70,000 and cash amounting to ₹1,30,000. The total liabilities equal the total \\nassets, ensuring that the balance sheet is balanced. Now if he decides to back out and desires to sell the machine, it may fetch more \\nthan or less than \\n.'), Document(page_content='So his financial position should be different. If going \\nconcern concept is taken, increase/ decrease in the value of assets in the short-\\nrun is ignored. The concept indicates that assets are kept for generating benefit in \\nfuture, not for immediate sale; current change in the asset value is not realisable \\nand so it should not be counted. This can be understood differently with some examples we may have come across \\nin real life.'), Document(page_content='Recently during pandemic, many businesses were shutting down due \\nto heavy losses. If the financial statement of these entities does not reveal the fact \\nof winding up due to losses, it will mislead the stakeholders. And, a sudden news \\nof the business shutting down would be a setback to those stakeholders. Therefore, entities need to assess at the time of preparation of financial \\nstatements, whether they are likely to continue to operate their business. If the \\nGoing Concern assumption is under question, the same information should be \\ncommunicated to the stakeholders. g) Cost concept: By this concept, the value of an asset is to be determined \\non the basis of historical cost, in other words, acquisition cost. Although there \\nare various measurement bases, accountants traditionally prefer this concept \\nin the interests of objectivity. When a machine is acquired by paying ₹ \\n, following cost concept the value of the machine is taken as ₹ \\n5,00,000. It is highly objective and free from all bias.'), Document(page_content='Other measurement \\nbases are not so objective. Current cost of an asset is not easily determinable. If the asset is purchased on 1.1.1995 and such model is not available in \\nthe market, it becomes difficult to determine which model is the appropriate \\nequivalent to the existing one. Similarly, unless the machine is actually sold, \\nrealisable value will give only a hypothetical figure. Lastly, present value base \\nis highly subjective because to know the value of the asset one has to chase \\nthe uncertain future. However, the cost concept creates a lot of distortion too as outlined below: \\na) In an inflationary situation when prices of all commodities go up on an \\naverage, acquisition cost loses its relevance. For example, a piece of land \\npurchased on 1.1.1995 for ₹ 2,000 may cost ₹ \\n as on 1.1.2022. So if \\n₹70,000\\n₹5,70, 000\\n5,00, 000\\n1,00, 000\\nthe accountant makes valuation of asset at historical cost, the accounts will \\nnot reflect the true position. b) Historical cost-based accounts may lose comparability.'), Document(page_content='Mr. X invested ₹ \\n1,00,000 in a machine on 1.1.1995 which produces ₹ 50,000 cash inflow \\nduring the year 2022, while Mr. Y invested ₹ 5,00,000 in a machine on \\n1.1.2005 which produced \\n cash inflows during the year. Mr.'), Document(page_content='X earned \\nat the rate \\n while Mr. Y earned at the rate \\n.'), Document(page_content='Who is more efficient? Since the assets are recorded at the historical cost, the results are not \\ncomparable. Obviously, it is a corollary to (a). c) Many assets do not have acquisition costs. Human assets of an enterprise \\nare an example. The cost concept fails to recognise such asset although it is a \\nvery important asset of any organization. Many other controversial issues have arisen in financial accounting that revolves \\naround the cost concept which will be discussed at the advanced stage. However, \\nlater on we shall see that in many circumstances, the cost convention is not \\nfollowed. See conservatism concept for an example, which will be discussed later \\non in this unit. h) Realization concept: It closely follows the cost concept. Any change in \\nvalue of an asset is to be recorded only when the business realises it. When an \\nasset is recorded at its historical cost of \\n and even if its current cost \\nis \\n such change is not counted unless there is certainty that such \\nchange will materialize. However, accountants follow a more conservative path.'), Document(page_content='They try to cover all \\nprobable losses but do not count any probable gain. That is to say, if accountants \\nanticipate decrease in value they count it, but if there is increase in value they \\nignore it until it is realized. Economists are highly critical about the realisation \\nconcept. According to them, this concept creates value distortion and makes \\naccounting meaningless. Thus, the going concern, cost concept and realization concept gives the valuation \\ncriteria. i) Dual aspect concept: This concept is the core of double entry book-\\nkeeping. Every transaction or event has two aspects: \\n1) It increases one Asset and decreases other Asset; \\n2) It increases an Asset and simultaneously increases Liability; \\n3) It decreases one Asset, increases another Asset; \\n4) It decreases one Asset, decreases a Liability. ₹50,000\\n50%\\n10%\\n₹5,00, 000\\n₹15,00, 000\\nAlternatively: \\n5) It increases one Liability, decreases other Liability; \\n6) It increases a Liability, increases an Asset; \\n7) It decreases Liability, increases other Liability; \\n8)It decreases Liability, decreases an Asset. j) Conservatism: Conservatism states that the accountant should not \\nanticipate any future income however they should provide for all possible \\nlosses.'), Document(page_content='When there are many alternative values of an asset, an accountant \\nshould choose the method which leads to the lesser value.'), Document(page_content=\"Later on, we shall \\nsee that the golden rule of current assets valuation - 'cost or market price \\nwhichever is lower' originated from this concept. The Realisation Concept also states that no change should be counted unless it \\nhas materialised. The Conservatism Concept puts a further brake on it. It is not \\nprudent to count unrealised gain but it is desirable to guard against all possible \\nlosses. For this concept there should be at least three qualitative characteristics of \\nfinancial statements, namely, \\ni. Prudence, i.e., judgement about the possible future losses which are to be \\nguarded, as well as gains which are uncertain.\"), Document(page_content='ii. Neutrality, i.e., unbiased outlook is required to identify and record such \\npossible losses, as well as to exclude uncertain gains, \\niii.Faithful representation of alternative values. This concept is of wider importance to investors since they would need to take a \\ndecision about their money being invested in the business.'), Document(page_content='Recording future \\nprofits when these have not been earned would suggest that the business is \\nbooming, and the investors would be tempted to put more money into the same. However, eventually if the profit is not earned, the investors are likely to loose \\ntheir investments. At the same time, if the entity expects to make a loss in future, \\nit is prudent to show that loss in the books in present itself. This acts as a \\nsafeguard for the investors as they would be prudent to make the investment \\ndecisions.'), Document(page_content='For example: Mr.'), Document(page_content=\"runs a business of computers. He purchased 10 \\ncomputers at a cost of \\n each and is expecting to be able to sell these \\ncomputers at the current market price of ₹ 25,000 each. Note that the \\nconservatism principle does not allow to recognise the profit on the computers \\nunless the sale has been made. Since, this is a future profit, Mr. X needs to follow \\nX\\n₹20,000\\na prudent approach while recording the transactions in his books and ignore the \\nprofit until it is earned \\nHowever, before sale, the market price of the computers declines to ₹ 17,000 \\neach. Under the conservatism approach, Mr. X needs to recognise that loss of \\n per computer, even though the sale has not been made. Many accounting authors, however, are of the view that conservatism essentially \\nleads to understatement of income and wealth and it should not be the basis for \\nthe preparation of financial statements. k) Consistency: In order to achieve comparability of the financial \\nstatements of an enterprise through time, the accounting policies are \\nfollowed consistently from one period to another; a change in an accounting \\npolicy is made only in certain exceptional circumstances. The concept of consistency is applied particularly when alternative methods of \\naccounting are equally acceptable. For example, a company may adopt any of \\nseveral methods of depreciation such as written-down-value method, straight-\\nline method, etc. Likewise, there are many methods for valuation of inventories. But following the principle of consistency it is advisable that the company should \\nfollow consistently \\nover years the same method of depreciation or the same method of valuation of \\nInventories which is chosen. However, in some cases though there is no \\ninconsistency, they may seem to be inconsistent apparently. In case of valuation \\nof Inventories if the company applies the principle 'at cost or market price \\nwhichever is lower' and if this principle accordingly results in the valuation of \\nInventories in one year at cost price and the market price in the other year, there \\nis no inconsistency here. It is only an application of the principle.\"), Document(page_content='But the concept of consistency does not imply non-flexibility as not to allow the \\nintroduction of improved method of accounting. An enterprise should change its accounting policy in any of the following \\ncircumstances only: \\na. To bring the books of accounts in accordance with the issued Accounting \\nStandards.'), Document(page_content='b.'), Document(page_content='To comply with the provision of law.'), Document(page_content='c.'), Document(page_content=\"When under changed circumstances, it is felt that new method will reflect \\na true and fair picture in the financial statement. l) Materiality: Materiality principle permits other concepts to be ignored, if \\nthe effect is not considered material. This principle is an exception to full \\ndisclosure principle. According to materiality principle, all the items having \\n₹3,000\\nsignificant economic effect on the business of the enterprise should be \\ndisclosed in the financial statements and any insignificant item which will \\nonly increase the work of the accountant but will not be relevant to the users' \\nneed should not be disclosed in the financial statements. The term materiality is the subjective term. It is on the judgement, common \\nsense and discretion of the accountant that which item is material and which is \\nnot. For example, stationary purchased by the organization though not used fully \\nin the accounting year purchased still shown as an expense of that year because of \\nthe materiality concept. Similarly, depreciation on small items like books, \\ncalculators etc. is taken as \\n in the year of purchase though used by the entity \\nfor more than a year. This is because the amount for books or calculator is very \\nsmall to be shown in the balance sheet though it is the asset of the company. The materiality depends not only upon the amount of the item but also upon the \\nsize of the business, nature and level of information, level of the person making \\nthe decision etc. Moreover, an item material to one person may be immaterial to \\nanother person.\"), Document(page_content=\"What is important is that omission of any information should not \\nimpair the decision-making of various users. 2.6.FUNDAMENTAL ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS \\nThere are three fundamental accounting assumptions: \\ni. Going Concern \\nii. Consistency \\niii.Accrual \\nAll the above three fundamental accounting assumptions have already been \\nexplained in para 2.5. If nothing has been written about the fundamental accounting assumption in the \\nfinancial statements then it is assumed that they have already been followed in \\ntheir preparation of financial statements. However, if any of the above-\\nmentioned fundamental accounting assumption is not followed then this fact \\nshould be specifically disclosed. 2.7.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nThe aim of accounting is to keep systematic records to ascertain financial \\nperformance and financial position of an entity and to communicate the relevant \\nfinancial information to the interested user groups. The financial statements are \\nbasic means through which the management of an entity makes public \\ncommunication of the financial information along with selected quantitative \\ndetails. They are structured financial representations of the financial position and \\n100%\\nthe performance of an enterprise. To have a record of all business transactions \\nand also to determine whether all these transactions resulted in either 'profit or \\nloss' for the period, all the entities will prepare financial statements viz., balance \\nsheet, profit and loss account, cash flow statement etc. by following various \\naccounting concepts, principles, and conventions which have been already \\ndiscussed in detail. 2.7.1.Qualitative Characteristics of financial Statements \\nQualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information provided \\nin financial statements useful to users. The following are the important \\nqualitative characteristics of the financial statements: \\n1. Understandability: An essential quality of the information provided in \\nfinancial statements is that it must be readily understandable by users. For \\nthis purpose, it is assumed that users have a reasonable knowledge of \\nbusiness, economic activities and accounting and study the information with \\nreasonable diligence. Information about complex matters that should be \\nincluded in the financial statements because of its relevance to the economic \\ndecision-making needs of users should not be excluded merely on the ground \\nthat it may be too difficult for certain users to understand. 2. Relevance: To be useful, information must be relevant to the decision-making \\nneeds of users. Information has the quality of relevance when it influences the \\neconomic decisions of users by helping them evaluate past, present or future \\nevents or confirming, or correcting, their past evaluations. The predictive and confirmatory roles of information are interrelated. For \\nexample, information about the current level and structure of asset holdings has \\nvalue to users when they endeavour to predict the ability of the enterprise to take \\nadvantage of opportunities and its ability to react to adverse situations. The same \\ninformation plays a confirmatory role in respect of past predictions about, for \\nexample, the way in which the enterprise would be structured or the outcome of \\nplanned operations. Information about financial position and past performance is frequently used as \\nthe basis for predicting future financial position and performance and other \\nmatters in which users are directly interested, such as dividend and wage \\npayments, share price movements and the ability of the enterprise to meet its \\ncommitments as they fall due. To have predictive value, information need not be \\nin the form of an explicit forecast. The ability to make predictions from financial \\nstatements is enhanced, however, by the manner in which information on past \\ntransactions and events is displayed. For example, the predictive value of the \\nstatement of profit and loss is enhanced if unusual, abnormal and infrequent \\nitems of income and expense are separately disclosed. 3. Reliability: To be useful, information must also be reliable, Information has \\nthe quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be \\ndepended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to \\nrepresent or could reasonably be expected to represent. Information may be relevant but so unreliable in nature or representation that its \\nrecognition may be potentially misleading. For example, if the validity and \\namount of a claim for damages under a legal action against the enterprise are \\nhighly uncertain, it may be inappropriate for the enterprise to recognise the \\namount of the claim in the balance sheet, although it may be appropriate to \\ndisclose the amount and circumstances of the claim. 4. Comparability: Users must be able to compare the financial statements of an \\nenterprise through time in order to identify trends in its financial position, \\nperformance and cash flows. Users must also be able to compare the financial \\nstatements of different enterprises in order to evaluate their relative financial \\nposition, performance and cash flows. Hence, the measurement and display of \\nthe financial effects of like transactions and other events must be carried out \\nin a consistent way throughout an enterprise and over time for that enterprise \\nand in a consistent way for different enterprises. An important implication of the qualitative characteristic of comparability is that \\nusers be informed of the accounting policies employed in the preparation of the \\nfinancial statements, any changes in those polices and the effects of such changes. Users need to be able to identify differences between the accounting policies for \\nlike transactions and other events used by the same enterprise from period to \\nperiod and by different enterprises. Compliance with Accounting Standards, \\nincluding the disclosure of the accounting policies used by the enterprise, helps to \\nachieve comparability. The need for comparability should not be confused with mere uniformity and \\nshould not be allowed to become an impediment to the introduction of improved \\naccounting standards. It is not appropriate for an enterprise to continue \\naccounting in the same manner for a transaction or other event if the policy \\nadopted is not in keeping with the qualitative characteristics of relevance and \\nreliability. It is also inappropriate for an enterprise to leave its accounting \\npolicies unchanged when more relevant and reliable alternatives exist. Users wish to compare the financial position, performance and cash flows of an \\nenterprise over time. Hence, it is important that the financial statements show \\ncorresponding information for the preceding period(s). The four principal qualitative characteristics are understandability, \\nrelevance,reliability and comparability. 5.\"), Document(page_content='Materiality: The relevance of information is affected by its materiality. Information is material if its misstatement (i.e., omission or erroneous \\nstatement) could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis \\nof the financial information. Materiality depends on the size and nature of the \\nitem or error, judged in the particular circumstances of its misstatement. Materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point rather than being a primary \\nqualitative characteristic which the information must have if it is to be useful. 6. Faithful Representation: To be reliable, information must represent \\nfaithfully the transactions and other events it either purports to represent or \\ncould reasonably be expected to represent. Thus, for example, a balance sheet \\nshould represent faithfully the transactions and other events that result in \\nassets, liabilities and equity of the enterprise at the reporting date which meet \\nthe recognition criteria. Most financial information is subject to some risk of being less than a faithful \\nrepresentation of that which it purports to portray. This is not due to bias, but \\nrather to inherent difficulties either in identifying the transactions and other \\nevents to be measured or in devising and applying measurement and \\npresentation techniques that can convey messages that correspond with those \\ntransactions and events. In certain \\ncases, the measurement of the financial effects of items could be so uncertain that \\nenterprises generally would not recognise them in the financial statements; for \\nexample, although most enterprises generate goodwill internally over time, it is \\nusually difficult to identify or measure that goodwill reliably. In other cases, \\nhowever, it may be relevant to recognise items and to disclose the risk of error \\nsurrounding their recognition and measurement.'), Document(page_content='7. Substance over Form: If information is to represent faithfully the \\ntransactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that \\nthey are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and \\neconomic reality and not merely their legal form. The substance of \\ntransactions or other events is not always consistent with that which is \\napparent from their legal or contrived form. For example, where rights and \\nbeneficial interest in an immovable property are transferred but the \\ndocumentations and legal formalities are pending, the recording of \\nacquisition/disposal (by the transferee and transferor respectively) would in \\nsubstance represent the transaction entered into. 8.'), Document(page_content='Neutrality: To be reliable, the information contained in financial statements \\nmust be neutral, that is, free from bias. Financial statements are not neutral if, \\nby the selection or presentation of information, they influence the making of a \\ndecision or judgement in order to achieve a predetermined result or outcome. 9. Prudence: The preparers of financial statements have to contend with the \\nuncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such \\nas the collectability of receivables, the probable useful life of plant and \\nmachinery, and the warranty claims that may occur. Such uncertainties are \\nrecognised by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by the exercise of \\nprudence in the preparation of the financial statements. Prudence is the \\ninclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of the judgments needed in \\nmaking the estimates required under conditions of uncertainty, such that \\nassets or income are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not \\nunderstated. However, the exercise of prudence does not allow, for example, \\nthe creation of hidden reserves or excessive provisions, the deliberate \\nunderstatement of assets or income, or the deliberate overstatement of \\nliabilities or expenses, because the financial statements would then not be \\nneutral and, therefore, not have the quality of reliability.'), Document(page_content='10. Full, fair and adequate disclosure: The financial statement must disclose \\nall the reliable and relevant information about the business enterprise to the \\nmanagement and also to their external users for which they are meant, which \\nin turn will help them to take a reasonable and rational decision. For it, it is \\nnecessary that financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally \\naccepted accounting principles i.e the information is accounted for and \\npresented in accordance with its substance and economic reality and not \\nmerely with its legal form. The disclosure should be full and final so that users \\ncan correctly assess the financial position of the enterprise. The principle of full disclosure implies that nothing should be omitted \\nwhile principle of fair disclosure implies that all the transactions recorded \\nshould be accounted in a manner that financial statement purports true \\nand fair view of the results of the business of the enterprise and adequate \\ndisclosure implies that the information influencing the decision of the users \\nshould be disclosed in detail and should make sense. This principle is widely used in corporate organizations because of \\nseparation in management and ownership. The Companies Act in pursuant \\nof this principle came out with the format of balance sheet and profit and \\nloss account. The disclosures of all the major accounting policies and other \\ninformation are to be provided in the form of footnotes, annexures etc. The \\npractice of appending notes to the financial statements is the outcome of \\nthis principle.'), Document(page_content='11. Completeness: To be reliable, the information in financial statements must \\nbe complete within the bounds of materiality and cost. An omission can cause \\ninformation to be false or misleading and thus unreliable and deficient in \\nterms of its relevance. Thus, if accounting information is to present faithfully the transactions and other \\nevents that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for \\nand presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality, not by \\ntheir legal form. For example, if a business enterprise sells its assets to others but \\nstill uses the assets as usual for the purpose of the business by making some \\narrangement with the seller, it simply becomes a legal transaction. The economic \\nreality is that the business is using the assets as usual for deriving the benefit. Financial statement information should contain the substance of this transaction \\nand should not only record going by legality. In order to be reliable, the financial \\nstatements information should be neutral i.e., free from bias. The prepares of \\nfinancial statements however, have to contend with the uncertainties that \\ninevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the collectability of \\ndoubtful receivables, the probable useful life of plant and equipment and the \\nnumber of warranty claims that many occur. Such uncertainties are recognised by \\nthe disclosure of their nature and extent and by exercise of prudence in the \\npreparation of financial statements. Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of \\ncaution in the exercise of judgement needed in making the estimates required \\nunder condition of uncertainty such that assets and income are not overstated \\nand loss and liability are not understated. UNIT – 3 \\n3.CAPITAL AND REVENUE EXPENDITURES AND RECEIPTS \\n3.1.INTRODUCTION \\nAccounting aims in ascertaining and presenting the results of the business for an \\naccounting period.'), Document(page_content='For ascertaining the periodical business results, the nature of \\ntransactions should be analyzed whether they are of capital or revenue nature. Revenue Expense relates to the operations of the business of an accounting \\nperiod or to the revenue earned during the period or the items of expenditure, \\nbenefits of which do not extend beyond that period. Capital Expenditure, on the \\nother hand, generates enduring benefits and helps in revenue generation over \\nmore than one accounting period. Revenue Expenses must be associated with a \\nphysical activity of the entity. Therefore, whereas production and sales generate \\nrevenue in the earning process, use of goods and services in support of those \\nfunctions causes expenses to occur. Expenses are recognised in the Profit & Loss Account through matching principal \\nwhich tells us when and how much of the expenses to be charged against revenue. A part of the expenditure can be capitalised only when these can be traced \\ndirectly to definable streams of future benefits. The distinction of transaction into revenue and capital is done for the purpose of \\nplacing them in Profit and Loss account or in the Balance Sheet. For example: \\nrevenue expenditures are shown in the profit and loss account as their benefits \\nare for one accounting period i.e., in which they are incurred while capital \\nexpenditures are placed on the asset side of the balance sheet as they will \\ngenerate benefits for more than one accounting period and will be transferred to \\nprofit and loss account of the year on the basis of utilisation of that benefit in \\nparticular accounting year. Hence, both capital and revenue expenditures are \\nultimately transferred to profit and loss account. Revenue expenditures are transferred to profit and loss account in the year of \\nspending while capital expenditures are transferred to profit and loss account of \\nthe year in which their benefits are utilised. Therefore, we can conclude that it is \\nthe time factor, which is the main determinant for transferring the expenditure to \\nprofit and loss account. Also, expenses are recognized in profit and loss account \\nthrough matching concept which tells us when and how much of the expenses to \\nbe charged against revenue. However, distinction between capital and revenue \\ncreates a considerable difficulty.'), Document(page_content=\"In many cases borderline between the two is \\nvery thin. 3.2.CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINING CAPITAL AND REVENUE \\nEXPENDITURES \\nThe basic considerations in distinction between capital and revenue expenditures \\nare: \\na) Nature of business: For a trader dealing in furniture, purchase of \\nfurniture is revenue expenditure but for any other trade, the purchase of \\nfurniture should be treated as capital expenditure and shown in the balance \\nsheet as asset. Therefore, the nature of business is a very important criteria in \\nseparating an expenditure between capital and revenue. b) Recurring nature of expenditure: If the frequency of an expense is \\nquite often in an accounting year then it is said to be an expenditure of \\nrevenue nature while nonrecurring expenditure is infrequent in nature and \\ndo not occur often in an accounting year. Monthly salary or rent is the \\nexample of revenue expenditure as they are incurred every month while \\npurchase of assets is not the transaction done regularly therefore, classified \\nas capital expenditure unless materiality criteria defines it as revenue \\nexpenditure. c) Purpose of expenses: Expenses for repairs of machine may be incurred \\nin course of normal maintenance of the asset. Such expenses are revenue in \\nnature. On the other hand, expenditure incurred for major repair of the asset \\nso as to increase its productive capacity is capital in nature. However, \\ndetermination of the cost of maintenance and ordinary repairs which should \\nbe expensed, as opposed to a cost which ought to be capitalised, is not always \\nsimple. d) Effect on revenue generating capacity of business: The expenses \\nwhich help to generate income/ revenue in the current period are revenue in \\nnature and should be matched against the revenue earned in the current \\nperiod. On the other hand, if expenditure helps to generate revenue over \\nmore than one accounting period, it is generally called capital expenditure. When expenditure on improvements and repair of a fixed asset is done, it has to \\nbe charged to Profit and Loss Account if the expected future benefits from fixed \\nassets do not change, and it will be included in book value of fixed asset, where \\nthe expected future benefits from assets increase. e) Materiality of the amount involved: Relative proportion of the \\namount involved is another important consideration in distinction between \\nrevenue and capital. 3.3.CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND REVENUE EXPENDITURES \\nAs we have already discussed, capital expenditure contributes to the revenue \\nearning capacity of a business over more than one accounting period whereas \\nrevenue expense is incurred to generate revenue for a particular accounting \\nperiod. The revenue expenses either occur in direct relation with the revenue or \\nin relation with accounting periods, for example cost of goods sold, salaries, rent, \\netc. Cost of goods sold is directly related to sales revenue whereas rent is related \\nto the particular accounting period. Capital expenditure may represent \\nacquisition of any tangible or intangible fixed assets for enduring future benefits. Therefore, the benefits arising out of capital expenditure last for more than one \\naccounting period whereas those arising out of revenue expenses expire in the \\nsame accounting period. 3.3.1.Key differences between Capital and Revenue Expenditures \\n➢Period of benefit: Capital expenditure is any expenditure incurred to \\nprovide a benefit over a long-term period. Revenue expenditure is any \\nexpenditure incurred to provide a benefit during the current period. ➢Enhancement vs Maintenance: Capital expenditure is incurred for the \\npurpose of increasing the capacity of the business or to reduce the costs of the \\nbusiness. Revenue expenditure is incurred to maintain the earning capacity \\nof the business. ➢Examples: Capital expenditure includes purchases of machines, cars, \\nfurniture, etc. Revenue expenditure includes repairs and maintenance, \\nsalaries of accounting staff, etc \\n3.4.CAPITAL RECEIPTS AND REVENUE RECEIPTS \\nJust as a clear distinction between Capital and Revenue expenditure is necessary, \\nin the same manner capital receipts must be distinguished from revenue receipts. Receipts which are obtained in course of normal business activities are revenue \\nreceipts (e.g., receipts from sale of goods or services, interest income etc.). On the \\nother hand, receipts which are not revenue in nature are capital receipts (e.g., \\nreceipts from sale of fixed assets or investments, secured or unsecured loans, \\nowners' contributions etc.). Revenue and capital receipts are recognised on \\naccrual basis as soon as the right of receipt is established. Revenue receipts \\nshould not be equated with the actual cash receipts. Revenue receipts are credited \\nto the Profit and Loss Account. On the other hand, Capital receipts are not directly credited to Profit and Loss \\nAccount. For example, when a fixed asset is sold for ₹ 92,000 (cost ₹ 90,000), \\nthe capital receipts ₹ 92,000 is not credited to Profit and Loss Account. Profit or \\nLoss on sale of fixed assets is calculated and credited to Profit and Loss Account , \\nSale Proceeds                                    ₹ 92,000 \\nCost                                                    (₹ 90,000) \\nProfit                                                   ₹ 2,000 \\nUNIT - 4  \\n4.CONTINGENT ASSETS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITES \\n4.1.CONTINGENT ASSET \\nA contingent asset may be defined as a possible asset that arises from past events \\nand whose existence will be confirmed only after occurrence or non-occurrence of \\none or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the \\nenterprise. It usually arises from unplanned or unexpected events that give rise to \\nthe possibility of an inflow of economic benefits to the business entity.\"), Document(page_content='For \\nexample, a claim that an enterprise is pursuing through legal process, where the \\noutcome is uncertain, is a contingent asset. As per the concept of prudence as well as the present accounting standards, an \\nenterprise should not recognise a contingent asset. These assets are uncertain \\nand may arise from a claim which an enterprise pursues through a legal \\nproceeding. There is uncertainty in realisation of claim. It is possible that \\nrecognition of contingent assets may result in recognition of income that may \\nnever be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, \\nthen the related asset no longer remains as contingent asset. A contingent asset need not be disclosed in the financial statements. A contingent \\nasset is usually disclosed in the report of the approving authority (Board of \\nDirectors in the case of a company, and the corresponding approving authority in \\nthe case of any other enterprise), if an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and if it has become virtually certain \\nthat an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income \\nare recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change \\noccurs. 4.2.CONTINGENT LIABILITIES \\nThe term \\'Contingent liability\\' can be defined as \\na. a possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of \\nwhich will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or \\nmore uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise; \\nor \\nb. a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised \\nbecause: \\ni. it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic \\nbenefits will be required to settle the obligation; or \\nii. a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made.\" \\nFor example- Mr. X sells a machine to Mr.'), Document(page_content='Y. Any damages incurred by Mr. Y \\nwhile using the machine need to be compensated by Mr.'), Document(page_content='X. A few days later from \\nthe date of sale of machine, Mr. received a notice from Mr. Y who is claiming \\ndamages of ₹ 20 lac. The notice mentioned that a worker met with an accident \\nduring the use of the machine and is required to be compensated. The receipt of this notice does not suggest that Mr. X is liable to pay the amount, \\nalthough this needs to be investigated and confirmed, as whether the damage \\narose due to any defect in the machine or it is due to negligence while operating \\nthe machine. Although, the receipt of the notice results into an event which \\nrequires recognition of a contingent liability since there is a possible \\nobligation, and that can only be confirmed in future. Taking another example let us assume Mr.'), Document(page_content='AB sells cars to its customers. One of \\nthe cars caught fire due to malfunctioning of a faulty part during the test drive by \\none of the customers. The customer has filed a court case seeking a claim of ₹ 50 \\nlac due to the incidence.'), Document(page_content='While Mr. AB acknowledges that there is a present obligation, it is not certain \\nthat whether he is expected to pay for any damages. The final outcome will only \\nbe known during the court proceedings. A contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and may \\narise in future depending on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more \\nuncertain future events [part (a) of the definition]. A contingent liability may also \\nbe a present obligation that arises from past events [(part (b) of the definition)]. An enterprise should not recognise a contingent liability in balance \\nsheet, however it is required to be disclosed in the notes to accounts, \\nunless possibility of outflow of a resource embodying economic \\nbenefits is remote. These liabilities are assessed continually to determine \\nwhether an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits has become \\nprobable. If it becomes probable that an outflow or future economic benefits will be \\nrequired for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is \\nrecognised in financial statements of the period in which the change in \\nprobability occurs except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable \\nestimate can be made. 4.3.DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND \\nLIABILITIES \\nThe distinction between a liability and a contingent liability is generally based on \\nthe judgement of the management. A liability is defined as the present financial \\nobligation of an enterprise, which arises from past events. The settlement of a \\nliability results in an outflow from the enterprises of resources embodying \\nX\\neconomic benefits. On the other hand, in the case of contingent liability, either \\noutflow of resources to settle the obligation is not probable or the amount \\nexpected to be paid to settle the liability cannot be measured with sufficient \\nreliability. Examples of contingent liabilities are claims against the enterprise not \\nacknowledged as debts, guarantees given in respect of third parties, liability in \\nrespect of bills discounted and statutory liabilities under dispute etc. In addition \\nto present obligations that are recognized as liabilities in the balance sheet, \\nenterprises are required to disclose contingent liability in their balance sheets by \\nway of notes. 4.4.DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND \\nPROVISIONS \\nProvision means \"any amount written off or retained by way of providing for \\ndepreciation, renewal or diminution in the value of assets or retained by way of \\nproviding for any known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with \\nsubstantial accuracy\". It is important to know the difference between provisions and contingent \\nliabilities. The distinction between both of them can be explained as follows: \\nProvision is a present liability of uncertain amount that can be reliably measured \\nusing substantial estimation, whereas a contingent liability is a potential \\nobligation dependent on uncertain future events. A provision satisfies the recognition criteria, while a contingent liability does not \\nmeet these criteria. Provision is acknowledged when there is a current obligation from past events \\nlikely to result in an economic benefit outflow, and the amount can be reliably \\nestimated; in contrast, a contingent liability includes obligations not recognized \\ndue to uncertainty in benefit outflow or amount estimation. Management recognizes a provision in the balance sheet if it is probable that \\nfulfilling an obligation will result in economic benefits outflow; conversely, if \\neconomic benefits outflow is unlikely, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent \\nliability. \\u200b \\nLet us take an example to understand the distinction between provisions and \\ncontingent liabilities. The Central Excise Officer imposes a penalty on Alpha Ltd.'), Document(page_content='for violation of a provision in the Central Excise Act. The company goes on an \\nappeal. If the management of the company estimates that it is probable that the \\ncompany will have to pay the penalty, it recognises a provision for the liability. On the other hand, if the management anticipates that the judgement of the \\nappellate authority will be in its favour and it is less likely that the company will \\nhave to pay the penalty, it will disclose the obligation as a contingent liability \\ninstead of recognising a provision for the same. UNIT - 5  \\n5.ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\n5.1.MEANING OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nAccounting Policies refer to specific accounting principles and methods of \\napplying these principles adopted by the enterprise in the preparation and \\npresentation of financial statements.'), Document(page_content='Policies are based on various accounting \\nconcepts, principles and conventions that have already been explained in Unit 2 \\nof Chapter 1. There is no single list of accounting policies, which are applicable to \\nall enterprises in all circumstances. Enterprises operate in diverse and complex \\nenvironmental situations and so they have to adopt various policies. The choice of \\nspecific accounting policy appropriate to the specific circumstances in which the \\nenterprise is operating, calls for considerate judgement by the management. ICAI \\nhas been trying to reduce the number of acceptable accounting policies through \\nGuidance Notes and Accounting Standards in its combined efforts with the \\ngovernment, other regulatory agencies and progressive managements. Already it \\nhas achieved some progress in this respect. The areas wherein different accounting policies are frequently encountered can \\nbe given as follows: \\n1) Valuation of Inventories; \\n2) Valuation of Investments. This list should not be taken as exhaustive but is only illustrative.'), Document(page_content='As the course \\nwill progress, students will see the intricacies of the various accounting policies. Suppose an enterprise holds some investments in the form of shares of a \\ncompany at the end of an accounting period. For valuation of shares, the \\nenterprise may adopt FIFO, average method etc. The method selected by that \\nenterprise for valuation is called an accounting policy. 5.2.SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nChoice of accounting policy is an important policy decision which affects the \\nperformance measurement as well as financial position of the business entity. Selection of inappropriate accounting policy may lead to understatement or \\noverstatement of performance and financial position. Thus, accounting policy \\nshould be selected with due care after considering its effect on the financial \\nperformance of the business enterprise from the angle of various users of \\naccounts. It is believed that no unified and exhaustive list of accounting policies can be \\nsuggested which has universal application. Three major characteristics which \\nshould be considered for the purpose of selection and application of accounting \\npolicies. viz., Prudence, Substance over form, and Materiality. The financial \\nstatements should be prepared on the basis of such accounting policies, which \\nexhibit true and fair view of state of affairs of Balance Sheet and the Profit & Loss \\nAccount. Examples wherein selection from a set of accounting policies is made, can be \\ngiven as follows:- \\n1. Inventories are valued at cost except for finished goods and by-products.'), Document(page_content='Finished goods are valued at lower of cost or market value and by-products \\nare valued at net realizable value. 2.'), Document(page_content='Investments (long term) are valued at their acquisition cost. Provision for \\npermanent diminution in value has been made wherever necessary. Sometimes a wrong or inappropriate treatment is adopted for items in Balance \\nSheet, or Profit & Loss Account, or other statement. Disclosure of the treatment \\nadopted is necessary in any case, but disclosure cannot rectify a wrong or \\ninappropriate treatment. 5.3.CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nA change in accounting policies should be made in the following conditions: \\na) It is required by some statute or for compliance with an Accounting \\nStandard \\nb) Change would result in more appropriate presentation of financial \\nstatement \\nChange in accounting policy may have a material effect on the items of financial \\nstatements. For example, if cost formula used for inventory valuation is changed \\nfrom weighted average to FIFO, or if interest is capitalized which was earlier not \\nin practice, or if proportionate amount of interest is changed to inventory which \\nwas earlier not the practice, all these may increase or decrease the net profit. Unless the effect of such change in accounting policy is quantified, the financial \\nstatements may not help the users of accounts. Therefore, it is necessary to \\nquantify the effect of change on financial statement items like assets, liabilities, \\nprofit/loss. For example, Omega Enterprises revised its accounting policy relating to \\nvaluation of inventories to include applicable production overheads. It intends to \\ndo as it believes that such change would result in a more appropriate \\npresentation of its financial statements. UNIT - 6  \\n6.ACCOUNTING AS A MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE - VALUATION \\nPRINCIPLES, ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \\n6.1.MEANING OF MEASUREMENT \\nMeasurement is vital aspect of accounting. Primarily transactions and events are \\nmeasured in terms of money.'), Document(page_content='Any measurement discipline deals with three basic \\nelements of measurement viz., identification of objects and events to be \\nmeasured, selection of standard or scale to be used, and evaluation of dimension \\nof measurement standards or scale. Prof.'), Document(page_content='R.'), Document(page_content='J. Chambers defined \\'measurement\\' as \"assignment of numbers to \\nobjects and events according to rules specifying the property to be measured, the \\nscale to be used and the dimension of the unit\". (R.J.'), Document(page_content='Chambers, Accounting \\nEvaluation and Economic Behaviour, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.'), Document(page_content=\"1966, \\nP.10). Kohler defined measurement as the assignment of a system of ordinal or cardinal \\nnumbers to the results of a scheme of inquiry or apparatus of observations in \\naccordance with logical or mathematical rules - [A Dictionary of Accountant]. Ordinal numbers, or ordinals, are numbers used to denote the position in an \\nordered sequence: first, second, third, fourth, etc., whereas a cardinal number \\nsays 'how many there are': one, two, three, four, etc. Chambers' definition has been widely used to judge how far accounting can be \\ntreated as a measurement discipline.\"), Document(page_content=\"According to this definition, the three elements of measurement are: \\n(2) Selection of standard or scale to be used; \\n(3) Evaluation of dimension of measurement standard or scale. 6.2.OBJECTS OR EVENTS TO BE MEASURED \\nWe have earlier defined Accounting as the process of identifying, measuring and \\ncommunicating economic information to permit informed judgements and \\ndecisions by the users of the information. So accounting essentially includes \\nmeasurement of 'information'. Decision makers need past, present and future information. For external users, \\ngenerally the past information is communicated. There is no uniform set of events and transactions in accounting which are \\nrequired for decision making. For example, in cash management, various cash \\nreceipts and expenses are the necessary objects and events. Obviously, the \\ndecision makers need past cash receipts and expenses data along with projected \\nreceipts and expenses. For giving loan to a business one needs information \\nregarding the repayment ability (popularly called debt servicing) of principal and \\ninterest. This also includes past information, current state of affairs as well as \\nfuture projections.\"), Document(page_content='It may be mentioned that past and present objects and events \\ncan be measured with some degree of accuracy but future events and objects are \\nonly predicted, not measured. Prediction is an essential part of accounting \\ninformation. Decision makers have to take decisions about the unseen future for \\nwhich they need suitable information. 6.3.STANDARD OR SCALE OF MEASUREMENT \\nIn accounting, money is the scale of measurement (see money measurement \\nconcept), although now-a- days quantitative information is also communicated \\nalong with monetary information. Money as a measurement scale has no universal denomination. It takes the shape \\nof currency ruling in a country. For example, in India the scale of measurement is \\nRupee, in the U.K. PoundSterling (  ), in Germany Deutschmark (DM), in the \\nUnited States Dollar ($) and so on. Also there is no constant exchange \\nrelationship among the currencies. If one businessman in India took loan \\n from a businessman of the U.S.A., \\nhe would enter the transaction in his books in terms of ₹ Suppose at the time of \\nloan agreement exchange rate was US \\n. Then loan amounted to ₹ \\n.'), Document(page_content='Afterwards the exchange rate has been changed to \\n. At the \\nchanged exchange rate the loan amount becomes₹ \\n. So money as a unit \\nof measurement lacks universal applicability across the boundary of a country \\nunless a common currency is in vogue. Since the rate of exchange fluctuates \\nbetween two currencies over the time, money as a measurement scale also \\nbecomes volatile. 6.4.DIMENSION OF MEASUREMENT SCALE \\nAn ideal measurement scale should be stable over time. For example, if one buys \\n.'), Document(page_content='cabbage today, the quantity he receives will be the same if he will buy \\n. £\\n$5,000\\n$ = ₹50\\n2,50, 000\\n$1 = ₹55\\n2,75, 000\\n1\\xa0kg\\n1\\xa0kg\\ncabbage one year later. Similarly, length of 1 metre cloth will not change if it is \\nbought a few days later.'), Document(page_content=\"That is to say a measurement scale should be stable in \\ndimension. Money as a scale of measurement is not stable. There occurs \\ncontinuous change in the input output prices. The same quantity of money may \\nnot have the ability to buy same quantity of identical goods at different dates. Thus information of one year measured in money terms may not be comparable \\nwith that of another year. Suppose production and sales of a company in two \\ndifferent years are as follows: \\nIn Year 1, 5,000 pieces were valued at ₹5,00,000, while in Year 2, 4,500 pieces \\nwere valued at ₹5,40,000 \\nLooking at the monetary figures one may be glad for \\n sales growth. In fact \\nthere was \\n production and sales decline. The growth envisaged through \\nmonetary figures is only due to price change. Let us suppose further that the cost \\nof production for the above mentioned two years is as follows: \\nIn Year 1, the quantity was 5,000 pieces valued at ₹4,00,000; in Year 2, it was \\n4,500 pieces valued at ₹4,50,000. Take Gross profit  Sales - Cost of Production. Then in the first year profit was ₹ \\n1,00,000 while in the second year the profit was ₹ 90,000 . There was \\n \\ndecline in gross profit. So, money as a unit of measurement is not stable in the dimension. Thus, Accounting measures information mostly in money terms which is not a \\nstable scale having universal applicability and also not stable in dimension for \\ncomparison over the time. So it is not an exact measurement discipline. 6.5.ACCOUNTING AS A MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE \\nHow do you measure a transaction or an event? Unless the measurement base is \\nsettled we cannot progress to the record keeping function of book-keeping. It has \\nbeen explained that accounting is meant for generating information suitable for \\nusers' judgments and decisions. But generation of such information is preceded \\nby recording, classifying and summarising data. By that process it measures \\nperformance of the business entity by way of profit or loss and shows its financial \\nposition. Thus, measurement is an important part of accounting discipline. But a \\nset of theorems governs the whole measurement sub- system. These theorems \\nshould be carefully understood to know how the cogs of the 'accounting-wheel' \\nwork. Now-a-days accounting profession earmarked three theorems namely \\ngoing concern, consistency and accrual as fundamental accounting assumptions, \\ni.e., these assumptions are taken for granted. Also while measuring, classifying, \\nsummarising and also presenting, various policies are adopted.\"), Document(page_content='Recording, \\nclassifying summarising and communication of information are also important \\npart of accounting, which do not fall within the purview of measurement \\n8%\\n10%\\n=\\n10%\\ndiscipline. Therefore, we cannot simply say that accounting is a measurement \\ndiscipline. But in accounting money is the unit of measurement. So, let us take one thing for \\ngranted that all transactions and events are to be recorded in terms of money \\nonly. Quantitative information is also required in many cases but such \\ninformation is only supplementary to monetary information. 6.6.VALUATION PRINCIPLES \\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are: \\ni.'), Document(page_content='Historical Cost; \\nii. Current Cost: \\niii.Realizable Value; \\niv. Present Value. Let us discuss these principles in detail.'), Document(page_content='1. Historical Cost: It means acquisition price. For example, the businessman \\npaid \\n to purchase the machine and spend \\n on its \\ninstallation, its acquisition price including installation charges is \\n. The historical cost of machine would be ₹8,00,000. According to this base, assets are recorded at an amount of cash or cash \\nequivalent paid at the time of acquisition.'), Document(page_content='Liabilities are recorded at the amount \\nof proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a \\nliability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid \\nto satisfy it in the normal course of business. When a businessman, takes ₹ 5,00,000 loan from a bank @ 10% interest p.a., it \\nis to be recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the \\nobligation. Here the obligation is the repayment of loan as well as payment of \\ninterest at an agreed rate i.e.'), Document(page_content='.'), Document(page_content='Proceeds received are \\n - it is \\nhistorical cost of the transactions. Take another case regarding payment of income tax liability.'), Document(page_content='You know every \\nindividual has to pay income tax on his income if it exceeds certain minimum \\nlimit. But the income tax liability is not settled immediately when one earns his \\nincome. The income tax authority settles it some time later, which is technically \\ncalled assessment year. Then how does he record this liability? As per historical \\ncost base it is to be recorded at an amount expected to be paid to discharge the \\nliability. ₹7,00, 000\\n₹1,00, 000\\n₹8,00, 000\\n10%\\n₹5,00, 000\\nCompanies usually apply historical cost method in case of long-term assets like \\nmachinery, furniture, licenses etc. 2.'), Document(page_content='Current Cost: Take that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 \\nat \\n. As per historical cost base he has to record it at \\n i.e. the acquisition price.'), Document(page_content='As on 1.1.2022, Mr. X found that it would cost ₹ \\n to purchase that machine. Take also that Mr. X took loan from a \\nbank as on 1.1.2011 ₹ 5,00,000 @ 18% p.a. repayable at the end of 15 th year \\ntogether with interest. As on 1.1.2022 the bank announces \\n prepayment \\npenalty on the loan amount if it is paid within 15 days starting from that day. As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or \\nproceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ \\n7,00,000.'), Document(page_content='Current cost gives an alternative measurement base. Assets are carried out at the \\namount of cash or cash equivalent that would have to be paid if the same or an \\nequivalent asset was acquired currently. Liabilities are carried at the \\nundiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents that would be required to settle \\nthe obligation currently. So as per current cost base, the machine value is \\n while the value of \\nbank loan is ₹ 5,05,000. Realisable Value: Suppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would \\nsell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying \\n and which would cost \\n in case he would buy it currently. Take also that Mr.'), Document(page_content='X found that he \\nhad no money to pay off the bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 currently.

Haphazard disposal may yield something less. Liabilities are carried at \\ntheir settlement values; i.e. the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents \\nexpressed to be paid to satisfy the liabilities in the normal course of business. So, the machine should be recorded at ₹ \\n the realisable value in an \\norderly sale while the bank loan should be recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 the settlement \\nvalue in the normal course of business.

To the \\neconomist, value is the utility (i.e.; satisfaction) of an economic resource to the \\nperson contemplating or enjoying its use.

Suppose, an individual purchased a car paying \\n. Its value lies in the satisfaction to be derived by that individual using \\nthe car in future. Economists often use ordinal scale to indicate the level of \\nsatisfaction. But accountants use only cardinal scales. If the value of car is taken \\nas ₹ 2,50,000 it is only one type of value called acquisition cost or historical cost. So value is indicated by measurement. In accounting the value is always \\nmeasured in terms of money. 6.8.ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \\nEarlier in this unit we have learned how to measure a transaction, which had \\nalready taken place and for which either some value/money has been paid or \\nA\\ni [1 −\\n1\\n(1 + i)n ]\\n1,00, 000\\n0.20\\n[1 −\\n1\\n(1 + 0.20)10 ] = ₹4,19, 246\\n90,000\\n0.20 [1 −\\n1\\n(1 + 0.20)5 ] + 5,00, 000\\n(1 + 0.20)5\\n= ₹2,69, 155 + ₹2,00, 939 = ₹4,70, 094\\n₹2,50, 000\\nsome valuation principles are to be adopted for their measurement.

As a result of the uncertainties inherent in business \\nactivities, many financial statement items cannot be measured with precision but \\ncan only be estimated. Therefore, the management makes various estimates and \\nassumptions of assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses as on the date of \\npreparation of financial statements. Such estimates are made in connection with \\nthe computation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses as well as, \\naccruals, provisions and employee benefit obligations.

UNIT - 7  \\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS \\n7.1 INTRODUCTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \\nAccounting as a 'language of business' communicates the financial results of an \\nenterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. If the \\nfinancial accounting process is not properly regulated, there is possibility of \\nfinancial statements being misleading, tendentious and providing a distorted \\npicture of the business, rather than the true. To ensure transparency, consistency, \\ncomparability, adequacy and reliability of financial reporting, it is essential to \\nstandardize the accounting principles and policies. Accounting Standards (ASs) \\nprovide framework and standard accounting policies for treatment of \\ntransactions and events so that the financial statements of different enterprises \\nbecome comparable. Accounting standards are written policy documents issued by the expert \\naccounting body or by the government or other regulatory body covering the \\naspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of accounting \\ntransactions and events in the financial statements. The ostensible purpose of the \\nstandard setting bodies is to promote the dissemination of timely and useful \\nfinancial information to investors and certain other parties having an interest in \\nthe company's economic performance. The accounting standards deal with the \\nissues of - \\ni. recognition of events and transactions in the financial statements; \\nii. measurement of these transactions and events; \\niii.presentation of these transactions and events in the financial statements in \\na manner that is meaningful and understandable to the reader; and \\niv. the disclosure requirements which should be there to enable the public at \\nlarge and the stakeholders and the potential investors in particular, to get an \\ninsight into what these financial statements are trying to reflect and thereby \\nfacilitating them to take prudent and informed business decisions. 7.2 OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \\nThe whole idea of accounting standards is centered around harmonisation of \\naccounting policies and practices followed by different business entities so that \\nthe diverse accounting practices adopted for various aspects of accounting can be \\nstandardised. Accounting Standards standardise diverse accounting policies with \\na view to: \\ni. eliminate the non-comparability of financial statements and thereby \\nimproving the reliability of financial statements; and \\nii. provide a set of standard accounting policies, valuation norms and \\ndisclosure requirements. Accounting standards reduce the accounting alternatives in the preparation of \\nfinancial statements within the bounds of rationality, thereby ensuring \\ncomparability of financial statements of different enterprises. 7.3 BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \\nAccounting standards seek to describe the accounting principles, the valuation \\ntechniques and the methods of applying the accounting principles in the \\npreparation and presentation of financial statements so that they may give a true \\nand fair view. By setting the accounting standards, the accountant has following \\nbenefits: \\ni. Standards reduce to a reasonable extent or eliminate altogether confusing \\nvariations in the accounting treatments used to prepare financial statements. ii.\"), Document(page_content='There are certain areas where important information are not statutorily \\nrequired to be disclosed. Standards may call for disclosure beyond that \\nrequired by law. iii.The application of accounting standards would, to a limited extent, \\nfacilitate comparison of financial statements of companies situated in \\ndifferent parts of the world and also of different companies situated in the \\nsame country. However, it should be noted in this respect that differences in \\nthe institutions, traditions and legal systems from one country to another \\ngive rise to differences in accounting standards adopted in different \\ncountries. The benefits of accounting standards. The content can be described in textbook \\nlanguage as follows \\nBenefits of Accounting Standards \\nAccounting standards provide several key advantages that are crucial for the \\nuniformity and transparency of financial reporting: \\n1. Standardisation of Alternative Accounting Treatments: Accounting \\nstandards mitigate inconsistencies by standardizing various methods \\navailable for accounting treatments. This eliminates the discrepancies that \\ncan arise when different practices are applied to similar transactions.'), Document(page_content='2. Requirements for Additional Disclosures: They necessitate comprehensive \\ndisclosures that give users of financial statements a more complete \\nunderstanding of the financial information presented. These disclosures are \\nintegral to ensuring that all relevant financial data is communicated \\neffectively.'), Document(page_content='3. Comparability of Financial Statements: One of the most significant \\nbenefits of accounting standards is the comparability they afford. By \\nproviding a consistent framework for financial reporting, these standards \\nmake it possible to compare financial statements across different periods and \\nentities, enhancing the decision-making process for investors, regulators, and \\nother stakeholders. The diagram illustrates a cyclic relationship indicating that the standardization of \\naccounting treatments and the requirement for additional disclosures contribute \\nto the overall benefits of accounting standards, which in turn leads to the \\ncomparability of financial statements. However, there are some limitations of accounting standards: \\ni. Difficulties in making choice between different treatments: \\nAlternative solutions to certain accounting problems may each have \\narguments to recommend them. Therefore, the choice between different \\nalternative accounting treatments may become difficult.'), Document(page_content=\"ii. Restricted scope: Accounting standards cannot override the statute. The standards are required to be framed within the ambit of prevailing \\nstatutes. Limitations of Accounting Standards \\nWhile accounting standards play a crucial role in financial reporting, they are not \\nwithout limitations: \\n1. Difficulties in Making Choice Between Different Treatments: Accounting \\nstandards can sometimes present challenges in selecting the most \\nappropriate accounting treatment among the various alternatives allowed. This difficulty arises due to the need for professional judgment in specific \\nscenarios where multiple treatments might seem applicable. 2. Restricted Scope: The scope of accounting standards can sometimes be \\nlimited. They may not cover every possible scenario or emerging transaction \\ntype, leading to areas where the accountant must use their discretion or seek \\nguidance from other regulatory frameworks. These limitations underscore the necessity for continuous review and updating of \\naccounting standards to ensure they remain relevant and comprehensive enough \\nto address new types of transactions and evolving business practices. 7.4 PROCESS OF FORMULATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN \\nINDIA \\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), being a premier \\naccounting body in the country, took upon itself the leadership role by \\nconstituting the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in 1977. The ICAI has taken \\nsignificant initiatives in the setting and issuing procedure of Accounting \\nStandards to ensure that the standard-setting process is fully consultative and \\ntransparent. The ASB considers International Financial Reporting Standards \\n(IFRSs) while framing Indian Accounting Standards (ASs) in India and try to \\nintegrate them, in the light of the applicable laws, customs, usages and business \\nenvironment in the country. The composition of ASB includes, representatives of \\nindustries (namely, ASSOCHAM, CII, FICCI), regulators, academicians, \\ngovernment departments etc. Although ASB is a body constituted by the Council \\nof the ICAI, it (ASB) is independent in the formulation of accounting standards \\nand Council of the ICAI is not empowered to make any modifications in the draft \\naccounting standards formulated by ASB without consulting with the ASB. The standard-setting procedure of Accounting Standards Board (ASB) can be \\nbriefly outlined as follows: \\n•\\nIdentification of broad areas by ASB for formulation of AS. •\\nConstitution of study groups by ASB to consider specific projects and to \\nprepare preliminary drafts of the proposed accounting standards. The draft \\nnormally includes objective and scope of the standard, definitions of the terms \\nused in the standard, recognition and measurement principles wherever \\napplicable and presentation and disclosure requirements. •\\nConsideration of the preliminary draft prepared by the study group of ASB \\nand revision, if any, of the draft on the basis of deliberations. •\\nCirculation of draft of accounting standard (after revision by ASB) to the \\nCouncil members of the ICAI and specified outside bodies such as \\nDepartment of Company Affairs (DCA), Securities and Exchange Board of \\nIndia (SEBI), Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C&AG), Central \\nBoard of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Standing Conference of Public Enterprises \\n(SCOPE), etc. for comments. •\\nMeeting with the representatives of the specified outside bodies to ascertain \\ntheir views on the draft of the proposed accounting standard. •\\nFinalisation of the exposure draft of the proposed accounting standard and its \\nissuance inviting public comments. •\\nConsideration of comments received on the exposure draft and finalisation of \\nthe draft accounting standard by the ASB for submission to the Council of the \\nICAI for its consideration and approval for issuance. •\\nConsideration of the final draft of the proposed standard and by the Council \\nof the ICAI, and if found necessary, modification of the draft in consultation \\nwith the ASB is done. •\\nThe accounting standard on the relevant subject (for non-corporate entities) \\nis then issued by the ICAI. For corporate entities the accounting standards are \\nissued by The Central Government of India. 7.5 LIST OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN INDIA \\nThe 'Accounting Standards' issued by the Accounting Standards Board establish \\nstandards which have to be complied by the business entities so that the financial \\nstatements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples.

ACCOUNTING PROCESS  \\nUNIT - 1  \\n1.BASIC ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES JOURNAL ENTRIES \\n1.1.DOUBLE ENTRY SYSTEM \\nDouble entry system of accounting is more than 500 years old. \"Luca Pacioli\" an \\nItalian friar & mathematician published Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, \\nProportioni, et Proportionalita (\"Everything about Arithemetic Geometry and \\nproportions\"). The first book that described a double entry accounting system.'), Document(page_content='Double entry system of book-keeping has emerged in the process of evolution of \\nvarious accounting techniques. It is the only scientific system of accounting. According to it, every transaction has two-fold aspects-debit and credit and both \\nthe aspects are to be recorded in the books of accounts. Therefore, in every \\ntransaction at least two accounts are effected. For example, on purchase of furniture either the cash balance will be reduced or a \\nliability to the supplier will arise and new asset furniture is acquired. This has \\nbeen made clear already, the Double Entry System records both the aspects. It \\nmay be defined as the system which recognises and records both the aspects of \\ntransactions. This system has proved to be \\nsystematic and has been found of great use for recording the financial \\ntransactions for all kind of entities requiring use of money. 1.2.ADVANTAGES OF DOUBLE ENTRY SYSTEM \\nThis system affords the under mentioned advantages: \\ni. By the use of this system the accuracy of the accounting work can be \\nestablished, through the device of the trial balance. ii.'), Document(page_content='The profit earned or loss incurred during a period can be ascertained \\ntogether with details. iii.The financial position of the entity or the institution concerned can be \\nascertained at the end of each period, through preparation of the financial \\nstatements. iv. The system permits accounts to be kept in as much details as necessary \\nand, therefore provides significant information for the purpose of control and \\nreporting. v.'), Document(page_content=\"Result of one year may be compared with those of previous years and \\nreasons for the change may be ascertained. In view of the above, the advantages of double entry system has been used \\nextensively in all countries. 1.3.Account \\nWe have seen how the accounting equation becomes true in all cases. A person \\nstarts his business with say, ₹ \\n as capital with corresponding balance of \\ncash ₹ \\n. For example, transactions entered into by the entity will alter \\nthe cash balance in two ways, one will increase the cash balance and other will \\nreduce it. Payment for goods purchased, salaries paid and rent expense paid, etc., \\nwill reduce the cash balance whereas sales of goods for cash and collection from \\ncustomers will increase it. We can change the cash balance with every transaction but this will be \\ncumbersome. Instead it would be better if all the transactions that lead to an \\nincrease are recorded in one column and those that reduce the cash balance in \\nanother column; then the net result can be ascertained. If we add all increases to \\nthe opening balance of cash and then deduct the total of all decreases, we shall \\nknow the closing balance. In this manner, significant information will be \\navailable relating to cash. The two columns which we referred above are put usually in the form of an \\naccount, called the ' \\n ' form. This is illustrated below by taking imaginary \\nfigures: \\nSince, each T-account shows only amounts and not transaction descriptions, we \\nrecord each transaction in some way, such as by numbering used in this \\nillustration.\"), Document(page_content=\"However, one can use date also for this purpose. 10,00, 000\\n10,00, 000\\nT\\nWhat we have done is to record the increase of cash on the left hand side and the \\ndecrease on the right hand side; the closing balance has been ascertained by \\ndeducting the total of payments, ₹ 23,00,000 from the total of the left - hand \\nside. Such a treatment of receipts and payments of cash is very convenient. Here we talked about only one account namely cash, now let us see how to make \\nT-accounts when assets as well as liabilities are effected from a particular \\ntransaction. Now, let us take some more examples:- \\nTransaction 1: \\nInitial investment by owners ₹ 25,00,000 in cash. This will effect two accounts namely cash and capital. The asset cash increases \\nand the stock holders' equity paid up capital also increases. CAPITAL \\nCapital account increased by ₹25,00,000. Transaction 2: \\nPaid cash to the creditors ₹ \\n \\nThis will effect cash account which will decrease and creditors account which is a \\nliability will also decrease. In transaction 2, cash payment to the creditors was ₹14,00,000, resulting in a \\ndecrease in both the cash account and the creditors account, which is a liability. The proper form of an account includes columns for Date, Particulars, and \\nAmount for both the debit and credit sides. \\u200b\\u200b \\nThe columns are self-explanatory. 1.4.DEBIT AND CREDIT \\nWe have seen that in T-accounts increase and decrease entries are made on the \\nleft and right side of the accounts for assets respectively and vice-versa for \\nliabilities. But, formally accountants use the term Debit (Dr.) to denote an entry \\non the left side of any account and Credit (Cr.) to denote an entry on the right \\nside of any account. We know that by deducting the total of liabilities from the total of assets the \\namount of capital is ascertained, as is indicated by the accounting equation. 14,00, 000\\nThe Basic Accounting Equation \\nThe accounting equation is a cornerstone of double-entry bookkeeping and \\nrepresents the relationship between a company's assets, liabilities, and capital. It \\ncan be expressed in two equivalent forms: \\n1. Assets = Liabilities + Capital This equation signifies that the total assets of \\na company are financed by obligations to external parties (liabilities) and \\nclaims by the owners (capital). 2. Assets - Liabilities = Capital Alternatively, this rearrangement of the \\nequation illustrates that the capital is equal to the assets minus the liabilities, \\nindicating the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting \\nliabilities. Both expressions of the accounting equation provide the same information: the \\nresources owned by the company (assets) are balanced by the company's debts \\n(liabilities) and the owners' interest (capital). To understand the equation better, let us expand it:- \\nThe Expanded Accounting Equation \\nThe accounting equation is a fundamental concept that illustrates the \\nrelationship between a company's assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity. It is \\nrepresented in two interrelated forms: \\n1. Basic Form: \\n·Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity \\n2. Expanded Form: \\nAssets = Liabilities + (Contributed Capital + Beginning Retained Earnings + \\nRevenue - Expenses - Dividends) \\nThis expanded form breaks down stockholders' equity into more specific \\ncomponents: \\nContributed Capital: The capital that has been directly invested by the \\nstockholders into the company. Beginning Retained Earnings: The accumulated earnings from previous periods \\nthat have not been distributed to stockholders as dividends.\"), Document(page_content=\"Revenue: The income generated from the company’s main operations and other \\nactivities. Expenses: The costs incurred in the process of earning revenue. Dividends: The portion of earnings distributed to stockholders. The equation emphasizes that a company's assets are financed either by \\nborrowing money (liabilities) or by funds provided by the owners (stockholders' \\nequity), which is itself composed of various factors including investments by the \\nowners, retained earnings, and the results of operations. Here, \\nContributed capital  the original capital introduced by the owner. Beginning retained earnings \\n previous earnings not distributed to the \\nshareholders. Revenue \\n generated from the ongoing activities of the business \\nExpenses \\n cost incurred for the operations of the company. Dividends \\n earnings distributed to the shareholders of the company \\nWe have also seen that if there is any change on one side of the equation, it is \\nbound to be similar change on the other side of the equation or amongst items \\ncovered by it or an opposite change on the same side of the equation. This is \\nillustrated below: \\nStarted business with cash ₹10,00,000, increasing total assets and owner's \\ncapital by the same amount. Borrowed ₹5,00,000, which increased total liabilities and total assets. Withdrew cash from business ₹2,00,000, decreasing total assets and owner's \\ncapital. Loan repaid to the extent of ₹1,00,000, decreasing total liabilities and total \\nassets. Bought furniture worth ₹3,00,000 with cash, increasing total assets in the form \\nof furniture while decreasing cash. The balance shows total assets of ₹12,00,000, total liabilities of ₹4,00,000, and \\nowner's capital of ₹8,00,000. As has been seen previously, what has been given above is suitable only if the \\nnumber of transactions is small.\"), Document(page_content=\"But if the number is large, a different procedure \\nof putting increases and decreases in different columns will be useful and this will \\nalso yield significant information. The transactions given above are being shown \\nbelow according to this method. Total assets increased by ₹15,00,000 and decreased by ₹3,00,000. Liabilities \\ndecreased by ₹1,00,000 and increased by ₹5,00,000. Owner's capital decreased \\nby ₹2,00,000 and increased by ₹10,00,000. The balance shows total assets of \\n₹12,00,000, liabilities of ₹4,00,000, and owner's capital of ₹8,00,000. \\u200b\\u200b \\nIt is a tradition that: \\ni. increases in assets are recorded on the left-hand side and decreases in \\nthem on the righthand side; and \\n=\\n=\\n\\xa0 =\\n\\xa0 =\\n\\xa0 =\\nii. in the case of liabilities and capital, increases are recorded on the right-\\nhand side and decreases on the left-hand side. When two sides are put together in T form, the left-hand side is called the 'debit \\nside' and the right hand side is 'credit side'. When in an account a record is made \\non the debit or left-hand side, one says that one has debited that account; \\nsimilarly to record an amount on the credit or right-hand side, it is said the \\naccount has been credited. From the above, the following rules can be obtained: \\ni. When there is an increase in the amount of an asset, its account is debited; \\nthe account will be credited if there is a reduction in the amount of the asset \\nconcerned: Suppose a firm purchases furniture for \\n, the furniture \\naccount will be debited by ₹ \\n since the asset has increased by this \\namount. Suppose later the firm sells furniture to the extent of ₹ 3,00,000 the \\nreduction will be recorded by crediting the furniture account by ₹ 3,00,000. FURNITURE \\nThe furniture account shows an increase of ₹8,00,000 due to cash paid for \\npurchase, and a decrease of ₹3,00,000 due to sale or disposal by cash. The \\nbalance in the furniture account is ₹5,00,000. \\u200b\\u200b \\nii. If the amount of a liability increases, the increase will be entered on the \\ncredit side of the liability account, i.e. the account will be credited: similarly, \\na liability account will be debited if there is a reduction in the amount of the \\nliability. Suppose a firm borrows ₹ 5,00,000 from Mohan; Mohan's account \\nwill be credited since \\n is now owing to him. If, later, the loan is \\nrepaid, Mohan's account will be debited since the liability no longer exists. MOHAN \\nThe account of Mohan shows a decrease by ₹5,00,000 due to cash payment \\nmade to him, and an increase by ₹5,00,000 due to cash received from him. \\u200b\\u200b \\niii.An increase in the owner's capital is recorded by crediting the capital \\naccount: Suppose the proprietor introduces additional capital, the capital \\naccount will be credited. If the owner withdraws some money, i.e., makes a \\ndrawing, the capital account will be debited. iv. Profit leads to an increase in the capital and a loss to reduction: According \\nto the rule mentioned in (iii) above, profit & incomes may be directly credited \\nto the capital account and losses & expenses may be similarly debited. However, it is more useful to record all incomes, gains, expenses and losses \\nseparately. By doing so, very useful information will be available regarding the \\n₹8,00, 000\\n8,00, 000\\n₹5,00, 000\\nfactors which have contributed to the year's profits and losses. Later the net \\nresult of all these is ascertained and adjusted in the capital account.\"), Document(page_content=\"v. Expenses are debited and Incomes are credited: Since incomes and gains \\nincrease capital, the rule is to credit all gains and incomes in the accounts \\nconcerned and since expenses and losses decrease capital, the rule is to debit \\nall expenses and losses. Of course, if there is a reduction in any income or \\ngain, the account concerned will be debited; similarly, for any reduction in an \\nexpenses or loss the concerned account will be credited. The rules given above are summarised below \\nRules of Debit and Credit in Double-Entry Bookkeeping \\n In the double-entry accounting system, every financial transaction affects at least \\ntwo accounts in a way that the accounting equation remains balanced. The rules \\nfor recording increases and decreases in different account types are: \\n1. Assets: \\nIncreases in assets are recorded as debits. Decreases in assets are recorded as credits. 2. Liabilities: \\nIncreases in liabilities are recorded as credits. Decreases in liabilities are recorded as debits. 3. Owner’s Capital: \\nIncreases in owner’s capital are recorded as credits. Decreases in owner’s capital are recorded as debits. 4. Expenses: \\nIncreases in expenses are recorded as debits. Decreases in expenses are recorded as credits. 5. Revenue or Incomes: \\nIncreases in revenue or incomes are recorded as credits. Decreases in revenue or incomes are recorded as debits. These rules are essential for maintaining the integrity of financial records and \\nensuring that all entries balance out in the ledgers. The terms debit and credit should not be taken to mean, respectively, favourable \\nand unfavourable things. They merely describe the two sides of accounts. Whether an entry is to the debit or credit side of an asset depends on the type of \\naccount and the transactions \\n➢Increase in Purchases is debited and Increase in Sales is credited. ➢Increase in Expenses is debited and Increase in revenue and Incomes is \\ncredited. ➢Increase in Assets is debited and Increase in Liabilities and Owners' \\nCapital is credited. \\u200b\\u200b \\nIn the same way, decrease in purchases, expenses and assets are credits and \\ndecrease in sales, income, liabilities and owners' capital are debit. 1.5.TRANSACTIONS \\nIn the system of book-keeping, students can notice that transactions are recorded \\nin the books of accounts. A transaction is a type of event, which is generally \\nexternal in nature and can be determined in terms of money. In an accounting \\nperiod, every business has huge number of transactions which are analysed in \\nfinancial terms and then recorded individually, followed by classification and \\nsummarisation process, to know their impact on the financial statements. A \\ntransaction is a two-way process in which value is transferred from one party to \\nanother. In it either a party receives a value in terms of goods etc. and passes the \\nvalue in terms of money or vice versa. Therefore, one can easily make out that in \\na transaction, a party receives as well as passes the value to other party. For \\nrecording transaction, it is very important that they are supported by a \\nsubstantial document like purchase invoices, bills, payslips, cash-memos, \\npassbook etc. Transactions analysed in terms of money and supported by proper documents are \\nrecorded in the books of accounts under double entry system. To analyse the dual \\naspect of each transaction, two approaches can be followed: \\n1) Accounting Equation Approach. 2) Traditional Approach. 1.6.ACCOUNTING EQUATION APPROACH \\nThe relationship of assets with that of liabilities and owners' equity in the \\nequation form is known as 'Accounting Equation'. Basic accounting equation \\ncomes into picture when sum total of capital and liabilities equalises assets, \\nwhere assets are what the business owns and capital and liabilities are what the \\nbusiness owes. Under double entry system, every business transaction has two-\\nfold effect on the business enterprise where each transaction affects changes in \\nassets, liabilities or capital in such a way that an accounting equation is \\ncompleted and equated. This accounting equation holds good at all points of time \\nand for any number of transactions and events except when there are errors in \\naccounting process. Let us suppose that an individual started business by contributing ₹ \\n \\nand taking loan of ₹ \\n from a bank to be repayable, after 5 years. He \\npurchased furniture costing ₹ \\n, and merchandise worth ₹ \\n. For purchasing the merchandise he paid ₹ \\n to the suppliers and agreed \\nto pay balance after 3 months. The contribution by the owner is termed as capital; the loans are termed as \\nliabilities. Whenever the loan is repayable in the short-run, say within one year, it \\nis called short-term loan or liability. On the other hand, if the loan is repayable \\natleast after one year, it would be termed as long term loan or liability. Some other short-term liabilities relating to credit purchase of merchandise are \\npopularly called as trade payables, and for other purchases and services received \\non credit as expense payables. The short-term liabilities are also termed as \\ncurrent liabilities and long term liabilities are termed as non-current liabilities. On the other hand, money raised has been invested in two types of assets-fixed \\nassets and current assets. Furniture is a fixed asset, if it lasts long, say more than \\none year, and has utility to the business, while inventory and cash balance will \\nnot remain fixed for long as soon as the business starts to roll-these are current \\nassets. Often the owner's claim or fund in the business is called equity.\"), Document(page_content=\"Owner's claim \\nimplies capital invested plus any profit earned minus any loss incurred. Now we have an equation: \\nEquity + Liabilities \\n Assets or, Equity + Long-Term Liabilities \\n Fixed Assets + \\nCurrent Assets - Current Liabilities \\nOn the left-hand side (LHS), Equity is ₹5,000, Long-term Liabilities are ₹1,000, \\nand Current Liabilities are ₹1,000, totaling ₹7,000 (in '000s). On the right-hand side (RHS), under Assets, Furniture (Fixed Asset) is ₹1,000, \\nInventory (Current Asset) is ₹5,000, and Cash is ₹1,000, totaling ₹7,000 (in \\n'000s). 50,00, 000\\n10,00, 000\\n10,00, 000\\n50,00, 000\\n40,00, 000\\n=\\n=\\nBoth sides balance at ₹7,000 (in '000s), which is a check for the accounting \\nequation where Total Assets are equal to the sum of Liabilities and Owner's \\nEquity. \\u200b\\u200b \\nCash = Capital + Loan - Furniture - Payment to Trade payables (₹' 000 ) \\n \\nLet us use \\n and \\n to mean Equity, Liabilities and Assets respectively at . Thus the basic accounting equation becomes \\n \\nor \\n (Eq. 1) \\n(₹' 000 ) \\nNow, let us suppose that at the end of period inventory valuing ₹ 2,500 is in \\nhand, cash ₹ 2,000; trade payables ₹ 500; bank loan ₹ 1,000 (interest was \\nproperly paid); furniture ₹ 800 {₹ 200 is taken as loss of value due to use (also \\nknown as depreciation)}. So at  - \\nAssets: \\nFixed assets, which include furniture, are valued at ₹800. Current assets, which consist of inventory and cash, are valued at ₹2,500 and \\n₹2,000 respectively, totaling ₹5,300 for current assets. Liabilities: \\nLong-term liabilities are ₹1,000. Current liabilities are ₹500, summing up to ₹1,500 for total liabilities. Equity, which is the difference between total assets (A) and total liabilities (L), is \\ncalculated as ₹3,800. \\u200b \\nEquity  Assets - Liabilities \\ni.e., \\n \\nor \\n \\nL e t u s c o m p a r e E 1 w i t h E 0 . E q u i t y i s r e d u c e d b y ₹ \\n. Reduction in equity is termed as loss \\nincurred. Since the business has incurred loss during the period, \\n becomes less than \\n. implies loss during t01 \\n= ₹5,000 + ₹1,000 −₹1,000 −₹4,000 = ₹1,000\\nE0, L0\\nA0\\nt0\\nE0 + L0 = A0\\nE0 = A0 −L0…\\nt1\\n=\\nE1 = A1 −L1\\nE1 + L1 = A1\\n12,00, 000(50,00, 000 −38,00, 000)\\nE1\\nE0\\nE1 < E0\\nSimilarly, \\n implies loss during \\n and so on. On the other hand, \\n implies profit earned by business during \\n \\nimplies profit earned during \\n and so on. So if En> En-1, in general terms, equity has increased, while En< En-1 implies \\nthat equity has decreased. Increase in equity is termed as profit while decrease in \\nequity is termed as loss. 1.7.TRADITIONAL APPROACH \\nUnder traditional approach of recording transactions one should first understand \\nthe term debit and credit and their rules.\"), Document(page_content='The term debit and credit have already \\nbeen explained in para 1.4 of this Unit. Transactions in the journal are recorded on the basis of the rules of debit and \\ncredit only. For the purpose of recording, these transactions are classified in three \\ngroups: \\ni. Personal transactions.'), Document(page_content='ii. Transactions related to assets and properties. iii.Transactions related to expenses, losses, income and gains. 1.7.1.Classification of Accounts \\ni. Personal Accounts: Personal accounts relate to persons, trade receivables \\nor trade payables. Example would be the account of Ram & Co., a credit \\ncustomer or the account of Jhaveri & Co., a supplier of goods. The capital \\naccount is the account of the proprietor and, therefore, it is also personal but \\nadjustment on account of profits and losses are made in it. This account is \\nfurther classified into three categories: \\na)\\nNatural personal accounts: It relates to transactions of human \\nbeings like Ram, Rita, etc. b)\\nArtificial (legal) personal accounts: For business purpose, business \\nentities are treated to have separate entity. They are recognised as \\npersons in the eye of law for dealing with other persons. For example: \\nGovernment, Companies (private or limited), Clubs, Co-operative \\nsocieties etc. c)\\nRepresentative personal accounts: These are not in the name of any \\nperson or organisation but are represented as personal accounts. For \\nexample: outstanding liability account or prepaid account, capital \\naccount, drawings account. E2 < E1\\nt12\\nE1 > E0\\nt01, E2 > E1\\nt21\\nii. Impersonal Accounts: Accounts which are not personal such as machinery \\naccount, cash account, rent account etc. These can be further sub-divided as \\nfollows: \\na)\\nReal Accounts: Accounts which relate to assets of the firm but not \\ndebt. For example, accounts regarding land, building, investment, fixed \\ndeposits etc., are real accounts. Cash in hand and Cash at the bank \\naccounts are also real. b)\\nNominal Accounts: Accounts which relate to expenses, losses, gains, \\nrevenue, etc. like salary account, interest paid account, commission \\nreceived account. The net result of all the nominal accounts is reflected as \\nprofit or loss which is transferred to the capital account. Nominal \\naccounts are, therefore, temporary. 1.7.2.Golden Rules of Accounting \\nAll the above classified accounts have two rules each, one related to Debit and \\none related to Credit for recording the transactions which are termed as golden \\nrules of accounting, as transactions are recorded on the basis of double entry \\nsystem. ➢Personal Account: Debit the receiver and credit the giver. ➢Real Account: Debit what comes in and credit what goes out. ➢Nominal Account: Debit expenses and losses and credit income and gains. \\u200b \\n1.8.MODERN CLASSIFICATION OF ACCOUNTS \\nReal, nominal and personal accounts is the traditional classification of accounts. Now, let us see the modern and more acceptable classification of accounts:- \\n➢Asset accounts have a normal debit balance and are debited when \\nincreased and credited when decreased. ➢Liabilities accounts have a normal credit balance and are credited when \\nincreased and debited when decreased. ➢Capital accounts have a normal credit balance and are credited when \\nincreased and debited when decreased. ➢Revenue accounts have a normal credit balance and are credited when \\nincreased and debited when decreased. ➢Expenditure accounts have a normal debit balance and are debited when \\nincreased and credited when decreased. ➢Withdraw accounts have a normal debit balance and are debited when \\nincreased and credited when decreased. In practice with the modern approach: \\n➢Cash, an asset, is debited to reflect an increase. ➢Capital, a liability, is credited to reflect an increase. ➢Wages/salaries paid, an expense, are debited to reflect an increase. ➢Cash, an asset, is credited to reflect a decrease. ➢Rent received, revenue, is credited to reflect an increase. ➢Purchase, an expense, is debited to reflect an increase. ➢Creditor, a liability, is credited to reflect an increase. ➢Cash, an asset, is debited to reflect an increase. ➢Sales, revenue, is credited to reflect an increase. \\u200b \\n1.9.JOURNAL \\nTransactions are first entered in this book to show which accounts should be \\ndebited and which credited. Journal is also called subsidiary book. Recording of \\ntransactions in journal is termed as journalizing the entries. It is the book of \\noriginal entry in which transactions are entered on a daily basis in a chronological \\norder. 1.9.1.Journalising Process \\nAll transactions may be first recorded in the journal as and when they occur; the \\nrecord is chronological; otherwise it would be difficult to maintain the records in \\nan orderly manner. Debits and credits are listed along with the appropriate \\nexplanations. There are basically two types of journals:- \\n1. General journal \\n2. Specialized journal \\nThe latter is used when there are many repetitive transactions of the same nature. The form of the journal is given below: \\nJOURNAL \\nDate (1): This column records the date on which the transaction occurred or was \\nentered into the books of accounts. Particulars (2): This section details the nature of the transaction or the names of \\nthe accounts that are to be debited or credited. Ledger Folio (L.F.) (3): This column indicates the page number of the ledger \\nwhere the corresponding account is maintained, facilitating quick reference. Amount Dr.'), Document(page_content='(4): This represents the amount that is to be debited from the \\nspecified account on the given date. Amount Cr. (5): This column shows the amount that is to be credited to the \\nspecified account on the recorded date. Each entry in this row reflects a single \\nfinancial transaction as recorded in the books of accounts. The columns have been numbered only to make clear the following but otherwise \\nthey are not numbered. The following points should be noted: \\n1) In the first column the date of the transaction is entered-the year is written \\nat the top, then the month and in the narrow part of the column the \\nparticular date is entered. 2) In the second column, the names of the accounts involved are written; first \\nthe account to be debited, with the word \"Dr\" written towards the end of the \\ncolumn. In the next line, after leaving a little space, the name of the account \\nto be credited is written preceded by the word \"To\" (the modern practice \\nshows inclination towards omitting \"Dr.\" and \"To\"). Then in the next line the \\nexplanation for the entry together with necessary details is given-this is called \\nnarration. 3) In the third column the number of the page in the ledger on which the \\naccount is written up is entered. 4) In the fourth column the amounts to be debited to the various accounts \\nconcerned are entered. 5) In the fifth column, the amount to be credited to various accounts is \\nentered. 1.9.2.Points to be taken into account while recording a transaction in \\nthe Journal \\n1. Journal entries can be single entry (i.e. one debit and one credit) or \\ncompound entry (i.e. one debit and two or more credits or two or more \\ndebits and one credit or two or more debits and credits). In such cases, it is \\nimportant to check that the total of both debits and credits are equal. 2. If journal entries are recorded in several pages then both the amount \\ncolumn of each page should be totalled and the balance should be written \\nat the end of that page and also that the same total should be carried \\nforward at the beginning of the next page. An entry in the journal may appear as follows: \\nMay 5: Debit entry of ₹14,50,000 to Bank Account, credit entry of ₹14,50,000 to \\nMohan\\'s account, reflecting the receipt of payment from Mohan against the \\noutstanding amount due from him. We will now consider some individual transactions. i. Mohan commences business with ₹ 50,00,000 in his bank account. This \\nmeans that the firm has ₹ 50,00,000 in bank. According to the rules given \\nabove, the increase in an asset has to be debited. The firm also now owes ₹ \\n to the proprietor, Mohan as capital. The rule given above also \\nshows that the increase in capital should be credited. Therefore, the journal \\nentry will be: \\nDebit entry to Bank Account of ₹50,00,000 and corresponding credit entry \\nto Capital Account, denoting the introduction of capital by Mohan into the \\nbusiness. ii.'), Document(page_content='Out of the above, ₹ 25,000 is withdrawn from the bank. By this \\ntransaction the bank balance is reduced by ₹ 25,000 and another asset, cash \\naccount, comes into existence. Since increase in assets is debited and \\ndecrease is credited, the journal entry will be: \\nDebit entry of ₹25,000 to Cash Account and credit entry of ₹25,000 to Bank \\nAccount, reflecting a cash withdrawal from the bank. iii.Furniture is purchased for \\n. Applying the same reasoning as \\nabove the entry will be: \\nDebit entry to Furniture Account for ₹12,00,000 and corresponding credit \\nentry to Bank Account, indicating the purchase of furniture. iv. Purchased goods for ₹ 4,00,000. The student can see that the required \\nentry is: \\nDebit entry to Purchases Account for ₹4,00,000 with a corresponding credit \\nentry to Bank Account, signifying the purchase of goods. v.'), Document(page_content='Purchased goods for ₹ \\n on credit from M/s Ram Narain Bros. Purchase of merchandise is an expense item so it is to be debited. ₹ \\n is now owing to the supplier; his account should therefore be \\ncredited, since the amount of liabilities has increased.

Amount is received in \\ncheque. The amount of bank increases and therefore, the bank amount \\nshould be debited; sale of merchandise is revenue item so it is to be credited. The entry will be: \\nDebit entry to Bank Account for ₹6,00,000 and credit entry to Sales \\nAccount, representing the revenue from goods sold to M/s Ram & Co \\nvii.Sold goods to Ramesh on credit for ₹ \\n. The Inventories of goods \\nhas decreased and therefore, the goods account has to be credited. Ramesh \\nnow owes ₹ \\n; that is an asset and therefore, Ramesh should be \\ndebited. The entry is: \\nDebit entry to Ramesh for ₹13,00,000 and a credit entry to Sales Account, \\nrecording the credit sale of goods to Ramesh. viii.Received cheque from Ramesh ₹ \\n. The amount of bank \\nincreased therefore the bank account has to be debited. Ramesh's liability \\ntowards firm has decreased in fact in this case he no longer owes any amount \\nto the firm now, i.e., this particular form of assets has disappeared; therefore, \\nthe account of Ramesh should be credited. The entry is: \\nDebit entry of ₹13,00,000 to Bank Account and credit entry of the same \\namount to Ramesh's account, recording the receipt of a cheque from Ramesh \\nagainst sales. ix.\"), Document(page_content='Paid rent ₹ 1,00,000. The bank balance has decreased and therefore, the \\nbank account should be credited. No asset has come into existence because \\nthe payment is for services enjoyed and is an expense. Expenses are debited. Therefore, the entry should be: \\nRent expense of ₹1,00,000 recorded as a debit to Rent Account and a \\ncorresponding credit to Bank Account, representing payment of rent for the \\nmonth. x. Paid ₹ 22,000 to the clerk as salary. Applying the reasons given in (x) \\nabove, the required entry is: \\nSalary payment of ₹22,000 recorded as a debit to Salary Account and a \\ncredit to Bank Account, for salary paid to the clerk for the month. xi.'), Document(page_content='Received ₹ 2,20,000 interest. The bank account should be debited since \\nthere is an increase in the bank balance. There is no increase in any liability; \\nsince the amount is not returnable to any one, the amount is an income, \\nincomes are credited. The entry is: \\nReceipt of ₹2,20,000 as interest income, recorded as a debit to Bank Account \\nand a credit to Interest Account, for the interest received for the period. 13,00, 000\\n13,00, 000\\n13,00, 000\\nWhen transactions of similar nature take place on the same date, they may be \\ncombined while they are journalised. For example, entries (  ) and (xi) may be \\ncombined as follows: \\nDebit entries of ₹1,00,000 to Rent Account and ₹22,000 to Salary Account with \\na total credit of ₹1,22,000 to Bank Account, reflecting payment for expenses as \\ndetailed in the attached documentation. When journal entry for two or more transactions are combined, it is called \\ncomposite journal entry. Usually, the transactions in a firm are so numerous that \\nto record the transactions for a month will require many pages in the journal. At \\nthe bottom of one page the totals of the two columns are written together with the \\nwords \"Carried forward\" in the particulars column. The next page is started with \\nthe respective totals in the two columns with the words \"Brought forward\" in the \\nparticulars column. Conclusion: \\nIt is evident from above analysis that procedure for analysis of transactions, \\nclassification of accounts and rules for recording business transactions under \\naccounting equation approach and traditional approach are different. But the \\naccounts affected and entries entered/passed remains the same under both \\napproaches. Thus, the recording of transactions in affected accounts on the basis \\nof double entry system is independent of the method of analysis followed by a \\nbusiness enterprise. In other words, accounts to be debited and credited to record \\nthe dual aspect remains the same under both the approaches. 1.10.ADVANTAGES OF JOURNAL \\nIn journal, transactions recorded on the basis of double entry system, fetch the \\nfollowing advantages: \\n1. As transactions are recorded in chronological order, one can get complete \\ninformation about the business transactions on timely basis. 2. Entries recorded in the journal are supported by a note termed as \\nnarration, which is a precise explanation of the transaction for the proper \\nunderstanding of the entry. One can know about the transactions through \\nthese narrations. 3.'), Document(page_content=\"Journal forms the basis for posting the entries in the ledger and reduces \\nthe chances of error. 1.11.ACCOUNTING FOR GST \\n1.11.1.Introduction to GST \\nx\\nGoods and Services Tax (GST) is a comprehensive Indirect Tax \\n which has \\nsubsumed multiple Indirect Taxes in India such as State Value added Tax (VAT) \\nwhich was levied on sale of goods, Excise Duty, which was levied on manufacture \\nor production of goods, Service Tax which was levied on provision of services etc. GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the \\nmanufacturer to consumer. •\\nAn indirect tax is a tax whose incidence is borne by the consumers who \\nultimately consume the product or service. The immediate liability to pay \\nthe tax may fall upon another person such as a manufacturer or provider \\nof service or seller of goods, but the same is collected from the person \\npurchasing the goods (recipient of goods or services). Pre-GST scenario: \\nPrior to introduction of GST, the following duties were levied: \\na) On manufacture of goods: Excise Duty (levied by Central Government) \\nb) On sale of goods within the State: State Value Added Tax (VAT) \\nc) On sale of goods outside the State: Central Sales Tax (levied by Central \\nGovernment) \\nd) On provision of services provided: Service Tax (levied by Central \\nGovernment) \\nSince the taxes were levied by different authorities (central and state authorities), \\nit was not possible to take the benefit of credit of taxes paid at different stages. For instance, when a trader received goods (say costing ₹ 1,00,000) from the \\nmanufacturer, excise duty (say @ 18% \\n ) was levied on the goods sold \\nby the manufacturer. When such trader would sell the goods to the customer, he \\nwould charge VAT (assume 18%). However, the trader could not avail the benefit \\nof the credit of the excise duty of \\n paid in respect of the goods purchased \\nfrom the manufacturer. Accordingly, the 'cost' of the goods to the trader would be \\n, on which the trader would add his profit \\nmargin and levy VAT while selling to the consumer. This created a scenario \\nwherein a tax (in our example, VAT) was levied on the tax (in our example, excise \\nduty) also, in addition to the tax levied on the goods. This cascading effect (tax-\\non-tax) increased the price of the product, and resulted in an unjust enrichment \\nat the cost of the ultimate consumer. Post-GST scenario: \\nOn introduction of GST, the tax to be levied at all stages right from manufacture \\nup to final consumption was a single tax- GST, with credit of taxes paid at \\n\\xa0∗\\n= ₹18,000\\n₹18,000\\n₹1,00, 000 + ₹18,000 = ₹1,18, 000\\nprevious stages available as setoff. Thus, in the example above, the GST \\n(erstwhile excise duty) of ₹ 18,000 paid by the trader could be availed as a credit \\n(an asset), for set off against the tax charged by the trader (a liability for the \\ntrader, which would be received from the consumer). Hence, the cost of the goods \\nto the trader would be ₹ \\n only, as ₹ 18,000 can be set off against the \\nGST charged by the trader to the consumer. The tax levied by the manufacturer to \\nthe trader becomes 'input tax' for the trader, since the goods are purchased by \\nhim (it is his input). The tax levied by the manufacturer to the trader, or the \\ntrader to the consumer is known as 'output tax' (since it is output for both the \\nmanufacturer and trader) both for the manufacturer and trader. The 'input tax' \\ncannot be added to the cost of the goods or services procured, as it will be \\nadjusted against the 'output tax' liability. In a nutshell, since the input tax is \\navailed as a credit, only the value addition (i.e., the profit margin levied by the \\ntrader to the consumer in our example) will be taxed, with the burden of tax \\nbeing borne by the final consumer. 1.11.2.Salient features of GST \\n•\\nGST is levied on supply i.e., manufacture or sale of goods and provision of \\nservices. In other words, supply is taxable event which own its occurrence \\ncreates or attracts the liability to pay tax. •\\nUnder GST, tax in levied only the value added at each stage of the supply \\nchain. •\\nGST is a destination-based consumption tax, i.e. the tax is levied at the \\nplace where the goods or services are consumed, rather than the place \\nwhere they are produced. •\\nThere is no tax on tax or cascading of taxes under GST system. •\\nUnder GST, there is a harmonization of laws, procedures and rates of tax \\nacross the country. 1.11.3.Types of Taxes under GST \\nBefore going through the types of taxes under GST, it is important to understand \\nthe concept of intra-State supply and inter-State supply under GST which \\ndetermines the type of tax to be charged by the supplier. The Concept of intra-state supply and inter-state supply depends upon on the \\nlocation of the supplier and place of supply (place of supply is the place where \\ngoods/services are consumed.\"), Document(page_content='As a general rule, where the location of the supplier and the place of supply of \\ngoods or services are in the same State/Union territory, it is treated as intra-State \\nsupply of goods or services respectively. 1,00, 000\\nSimilarly, where the location of the supplier and the place of supply of goods or \\nservices are in (i) two different States or (ii) two different Union Territories or \\n(iii) a State and a Union territory, it is treated as inter-State supply of goods or \\nservices respectively. GST has a dual aspect with the Centre and States simultaneously levying on a \\ncommon tax base. There are three main components of GST which are: \\ni. Central Goods and Service Tax (CGST) is levied and collected by the \\nCentre on the \"Intra -State\" supply of goods and services. ii. State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) is levied and collected by the State \\nGovernments (including Union Territories with legislature, for example \\nDelhi, Pondicherry, Jammu and Kashmir) on \"Intra state\" supply of goods \\nand services \\niii.Union Territory Goods and Service Tax (UTGST) is levied and collected by \\nUnion Territories without Legislatures [i.e. Andaman and Nicobar Islands, \\nLakshadweep, Ladakh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli & Daman and Diu and \\nChandigarh] on \"intra-state\" supply of goods and services. iv. Integrated Goods and services tax (IGST): It is the GST levied on the \"inter \\nstate\" supply of goods and services and is collected by the Centre. IGST is \\nequivalent to the sum total of CGST and SGST. GST is a \"Consumption Based Tax\" i.e. the tax is received by the State in which \\nthe goods or services are consumed and not by the state in which the goods and \\nservices are manufactured. Structure of Goods and Services Tax (GST) \\nGST, a comprehensive indirect tax on the manufacture, sale, and consumption of \\ngoods and services, is classified into two categories: \\n1. Intra-State GST: This pertains to transactions within a single state and is \\nfurther divided into two parts: \\nCentral GST (CGST): Levied by the Central Government. ·State GST (SGST): Levied by the State Government. 2. Inter-State GST: This applies to transactions between two states or a state \\nand a union territory. It is known as: \\nIntegrated GST (IGST): Levied by the Central Government and shared with the \\nstates. This tax structure aims to create a single unified market by eliminating the \\ncascading effect of taxes on goods and services across India. 1.11.4.Input and Output GST \\nThe tax paid by the recipient on procurement of goods /services is called Input \\ntax. An entity at each stage is permitted to avail credit of GST paid on the \\npurchase of goods and /or availment of services and can set off this credit against \\nthe GST payable on the goods and/or services supplied by him. Thus, the final \\nconsumer bears the GST charged in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all \\nthe previous stages. Hence, the tax will be levied only on the value added, which \\nresults in avoiding double taxation. For example, if tax payable by a manufacturer \\non the output, i.e.'), Document(page_content='final product is \\n and he has already paid tax on \\n on \\ninput, i.e. purchases, then he can claim \\'Input Credit\\' of ₹500 and he needs to \\ndeposit only ₹250 in cash. Output tax means the GST charged on supply of goods or services made by a \\nsupplier. Input tax means the credit of Input tax already paid. Utilisation of Input Tax Credit under GST \\nTax credit of CGST, SGST and IGST can be utilized in the following manner: \\n•\\nUtilization of IGST Credit: IGST credit has to be first utilized against IGST \\nliability and if any balance is still available, the same can be utilized \\nagainst CGST or/and SGST in any order and in any proportion. •\\nUtilization of CGST Credit: CGST credit has to be first utilized against \\nCGST liability and if any balance is available, same can be utilized against \\nIGST. However, CGST credit cannot be utilized against SGST. •\\nUtilization of SGST Credit: SGST credit has to be first utilized against \\nSGST liability and if any balance is available, same can be utilized against \\nIGST. However, SGST credit cannot be utilized against CGST. Input GST, which is credited, can be availed and is therefore an asset. It is \\ndebited to the \"Input GST Account\" at the time of goods or services purchase. Output GST, charged to the consumer and payable by the supplier, is credited to \\nthe \"Output GST Account\" and represents a liability. For intra-state transactions, \\nthe CGST paid is debited to \"Input CGST Account\" and SGST paid is debited to \\n\"Input SGST Account,\" while the charged CGST and SGST are credited to their \\nrespective output accounts. For inter-state transactions, IGST paid is debited to \\n\"Input IGST Account\" and charged IGST is credited to \"Output IGST Account.\" \\nReversal of GST is accounted for when goods are returned, used for drawings, \\ndistributed as free samples, or given as gifts not qualifying as a supply under \\nGST. Finally, the input GST credit is denied for goods lost in fire or theft and for \\nsupplies not eligible to be availed by the recipient.'), Document(page_content='Input GST Account is credited \\nwhen tax is paid by utilizing input tax credit. ₹750\\n₹500\\nDouble entry book-keeping with GST \\nThe Double entry book-keeping records need to show the GST values separately \\nso that the purchases, expenses and sales are posted net i.e. without the addition \\nof GST.'), Document(page_content='Journal entry in case of Sales of Goods or services \\nAccount Receivable/Debtors A/c Dr. Gross Amount (including GST) \\nTo Sales A/c \\nTo Output GST \\nNet Amount (excluding GST) \\nAmount of GST \\nJournal entry in case of Purchase of Goods or services \\nPurchases A/c Dr. Input GST A/c Dr. To Account Payable/Creditors \\nGross Amount (including GST) \\nJournal entry in case of Utilization of Input Tax Credit towards \\npayment of Output Tax \\nOutput CGST A/c \\nOutput SGST A/c \\nOutput IGST A/c \\nTo Input CGST A/c \\nTo Input SGST A/c \\nTo Input IGST A/c \\nDr. Dr.'), Document(page_content='Dr. Amount of GST liability \\nAmount of GST liability \\nAmount of GST liability \\nAmount of output GST liability paid utilizing Input CGST \\nAmount of output GST liability paid utilizing Input SGST \\nAmount of output GST liability paid utilizing Input IGST \\nUNIT 2 :  \\n2.LEDGERS \\n2.1.INTRODUCTION \\nAfter recording the original transactions in the journal, recorded entries are \\nclassified and grouped into by preparation of accounts. The book which contains \\nall set of accounts (viz.'), Document(page_content='personal, real and nominal accounts), is known as Ledger. It is known as principal books of account in which account-wise balance of each \\naccount is determined. 2.2.SPECIMEN OF LEDGER ACCOUNTS \\nA ledger account has two sides-debit (left side of the account) and credit (right \\nside of the account). Each of the debit and credit side has four columns. (i) Date \\n(ii) Particulars (iii) Journal folio i.e. page from where the entries are taken for \\nposting and (iv) Amount. Dr.'), Document(page_content=\"Account Cr. Date: This column is used to record the date when a financial transaction takes \\nplace. Particulars: This column describes the details of the transaction, including the \\naccounts affected. J.F. (Journal Folio): This column refers to the page number in the journal where \\nthe transaction is recorded, for easy reference. Amount (₹): This column shows the monetary value of the transaction in Indian \\nRupees (₹). Each row in this table represents a separate entry in the accounting \\nrecords. 2.3.POSTING \\nThe process of transferring the debit and credit items from journal to classified \\naccounts in the ledger is known as posting. 2.3.1.Rules regarding Posting of Entries in the Ledger \\n1. Separate account is opened in ledger book for each distinct account and \\nentries from Journal are posted to respective account accordingly. 2. It is a practice to use words 'To' and 'By' while posting transactions in the \\nledger. The word 'To' is used in the particular column with the accounts \\nwritten on the debit side while 'By' is used with the accounts written in the \\nparticular column of the credit side. These 'To' and 'By' do not have any \\nmeanings but are used to the account debited and credited. 3.\"), Document(page_content='The concerned account debited in the journal should also be debited in the \\nledger but reference should be of the respective credit account. 2.4.BALANCING AN ACCOUNT \\nAt the end of each month or year or any particular reporting period, it may be \\nnecessary to ascertain the balance in an account. Suppose a person has bought \\ngoods worth ₹1,000 and has paid only ₹ 850; he owes ₹150 and that is the \\nbalance in his account. To ascertain the balance in any account, both the sides of \\nthe account is totalled and smaller amount is deducted from the bigger amount to \\nascertain the difference. If the credit side is bigger than the debit side, it is a \\ncredit balance and vice a versa. The credit balance is written on the debit side as, \\n\"To Balance c/d\"; c/d means \"carried down\". By doing this, two sides will be \\nequal. The totals are written on the two sides opposite one another. Then the credit balance is written on the credit side as \"By balance b/d (i.e., \\nbrought down)\". This is the opening balance for the new period. The debit \\nbalance similarly is written on the credit side as \"By Balance \\n \", the totals then \\nare written on the two sides as shown above and then the debit balance written \\non the debit side as, \"To Balance b/d\", as the opening balance of the new period. It should be noted that nominal accounts are not balanced; the balance in the end \\nare transferred to the profit and loss account. Only personal and real accounts \\nbalances are ultimately shown in the balance sheet at the end of the accounting \\nperiod. The capital account is adjusted for profit or loss (i.e net of nominal \\naccounts) at the end of accounting period. UNIT 3 :  \\n3.TRIAL BALANCE \\n3.1.INTRODUCTION \\nc/d\\nPreparation of trial balance is the third phase in the accounting process. After \\nposting the accounts in the ledger, a statement is prepared to show separately the \\ndebit and credit balances. Such a statement is known as the trial balance. It may \\nalso be prepared by listing each and every account and entering in separate \\ncolumns the totals of the debit and credit sides. Whichever way it is prepared, the \\ntotals of the two columns should agree. An agreement indicates arithmetic \\naccuracy of the accounting work; if the two sides do not agree, then there is \\nsimply an arithmetic error(s). This follows from the fact that under the Double Entry System, the amount \\nwritten on the debit sides of various accounts is always equal to the amounts \\nentered on the credit sides of other accounts and vice versa. Hence the totals of \\nthe debit sides must be equal to the totals of the credit sides. Also total of the \\ndebit balances will be equal to the total of the credit balances. Once this \\nagreement is established, there is reasonable confidence that the accounting work \\nis free from clerical errors, though it is not a proof of cent per cent accuracy, \\nbecause some errors of principle and compensating errors may still remain. Generally, to check the arithmetic accuracy of accounts, trial balance is prepared \\nat monthly intervals. But because double entry system is followed, one can \\nprepare a trial balance any time. Though a trial balance can be prepared any time \\nbut it is preferable to prepare it at the end of the reporting period which may be \\nmonth end/quarter end/year end to ensure the arithmetic accuracy of all the \\naccounts before the preparation of the financial statements. It may be noted that \\ntrial balance is a statement and not an account. 3.2. OBJECTIVES OF PREPARING THE TRIAL BALANCE \\nThe preparation of trial balance has the following objectives: \\ni. Trial balance enables one to establish whether the posting and other \\naccounting processes have been carried out without committing arithmetical \\nerrors. In other words, the trial balance helps to establish arithmetical \\naccuracy of the books of accounts. ii. Financial statements are normally prepared on the basis of agreed trial \\nbalance; otherwise the financial statements will not give true and fair picture \\nof the financial transactions. iii.The trial balance serves as a summary of what is contained in the ledger; \\nthe ledger may have to be seen only when details are required in respect of an \\naccount. The form of the trial balance is simple as shown below: \\nTrial Balance \\nas at……………. Serial Number (S.No): This column enumerates the entries for reference and \\norder.'), Document(page_content='Ledger Accounts: This column lists the names of the accounts that have been \\naffected by the transactions. Debit Amount (Dr. Amount): This represents the total or balance amount that \\nhas been debited from the respective ledger accounts. Credit Amount (Cr. Amount): This column shows the total or balance amount \\nthat has been credited to the respective ledger accounts. Each entry records the \\nfinancial position of an account in terms of total debits and credits.'), Document(page_content='The under mentioned points may be noted: \\ni. A trial balance is prepared as on a particular date which should be \\nmentioned at the top. ii. In the second column the name of the account is written. iii.In the third column the total of the debit side of the account concerned or \\nthe debit balance, if any is entered. iv. In the fourth column, the total of the credit side or the credit balance is \\nwritten. v.'), Document(page_content='(v) The third and fourth columns are totalled at the end. 3.3.LIMITATIONS OF TRIAL BALANCE \\nOne should note that the agreement of Trial Balance is not a conclusive proof of \\naccuracy. In other words, in spite of the agreement of the trial balance some \\nerrors may remain. These may be of the following types: \\ni.'), Document(page_content='Transaction has not been entered at all in the journal. ii. A wrong amount has been written in both columns of the journal. iii.A wrong account has been mentioned in the journal. iv. An entry has not at all been posted in the ledger. v.'), Document(page_content='Entry is posted twice in the ledger. Still, the preparation of the trial balance is very useful; without it, the preparation \\nof financial statements, would be difficult. 3.4.METHODS OF PREPARATION OF TRIAL BALANCE \\n1. TOTAL METHOD \\nUnder this method, every ledger account is totalled and that total amount (both \\nof debit side and credit side) is transferred to trial balance. In this method, trial \\nbalance can be prepared as soon as ledger account is totalled. Time taken to \\nbalance the ledger accounts is saved under this method as balance can be found \\nout in the trial balance itself. The difference of totals of each ledger account is the \\nbalance of that particular account. This method is not commonly used as for the \\npreparation of the financial statements, only net balance of the ledger account is \\nrequired. Therefore, the trial balance compiled under this method cannot be used \\ndirectly for preparation of the financial statements. 2. BALANCE METHOD \\nUnder this method, every ledger account is balanced and those balances only are \\ncarried forward to the trial balance. This method is used commonly by the \\naccountants and helps in the preparation of the financial statements. Financial \\nstatements are prepared on the basis of the balances of the ledger accounts. 3.'), Document(page_content='TOTAL AND BALANCE METHOD \\nUnder this method, the above two explained methods are combined. This has \\nbeen explained with the help of the following example: \\nTrial Balance of  as at 31.03.2022 \\nCash Account shows a debit balance of ₹7,500, with total debits amounting to \\n₹35,500 and credits totaling ₹28,000. Furniture Account has a debit balance of ₹3,000, represented entirely by the \\ntotal debits with no credits. Salaries Account has a debit balance of ₹2,500, with no corresponding credit \\nentries. Shyam’s Account has a credit balance of ₹3,500, with total debits of ₹21,500 and \\ncredits totaling ₹25,000. Purchases Account records total debits of ₹26,000, with no credits, reflecting the \\ntotal amount spent on purchases. Purchase Returns Account has a credit balance of ₹500, indicating the value of \\npurchases returned. Ram’s Account shows a credit balance of ₹25,100, with total debits of ₹4,900 \\nagainst total credits of ₹30,000. X\\nSales Account has a credit balance of ₹30,500, which is the total income from \\nsales with no debits. Sale Returns Account records a debit balance of ₹100, signifying the amount in \\nsales that was returned. Capital Account shows a debit entry of ₹9,500 and a credit entry of ₹500, with a \\ncredit balance of ₹10,000. 3.5.ADJUSTED TRIAL BALANCE (THROUGH SUSPENSE ACCOUNT) \\nIf the trial balance does not agree after transferring the balance of all ledger \\naccounts including cash and bank balance and also errors are not located timely, \\nthen the trial balance is tallied by transferring the difference of debit and credit \\nside to an account known as suspense account. This is a temporary account \\nopened to proceed further and to prepare the financial statements timely. 3.6.RULES OF PREPARING THE TRIAL BALANCE \\nWhile preparing the trial balance from the given list of ledger balances, following \\nrules should be taken into account: \\n1. The balances of all (i) assets accounts (ii) expenses accounts (iii) losses (iv) \\ndrawings are placed in the debit column of the trial balance. 2. The balances of all (i) liabilities accounts (ii) income accounts (iii) gains (iv) \\ncapital are placed in the credit column of the trial balance. Notes: \\n1.'), Document(page_content='Dues from customers is an asset, so its balance will be a debit balance. 2. Purchases return account always shows a credit balance because assets go out. 3. Balance in Trade payables is a liability, so its balance will be a credit balance. 4. Bills payable is a liability, so its balance will be a credit balance. 5. Inventory (opening) represents assets, so it will have a debit balance. 6. Sales return account always shows a debit balance because assets come. UNIT - 4 SUBSIDIARY BOOKS \\n4.1 INTRODUCTION \\nIn a business, most of the transactions generally relate to receipts and payments \\nof cash, sale of goods and their purchase. It is convenient to keep a separate \\nregister for each such class of transactions one for receipts and payments of cash, \\none for purchase of goods and one for sale of goods. A register of this type is \\ncalled a book of original entry or of prime entry. The transactions recorded in \\nsuch books will not require journal entries. The system by which transactions of a \\nclass are first recorded in the specified book, specially meant for it and on the \\nbasis of which ledger accounts are then prepared is known as the Practical \\nSystem of Book keeping or even the English System. It should be noted that in \\nthis system, there is no departure from the rules of the double entry system. These books of original or prime entry are also called subsidiary books since \\nledger accounts are prepared on their basis without further processing of ledger \\nposting. Normally, the following subsidiary books are used in a business: \\ni. Cash Book to record receipts and payments of cash, including receipts into \\nand payments out of the bank. ii. Purchases Book to record credit purchases of goods dealt in or of the \\nmaterials and stores required in the factory. iii.Purchase Returns Book to record the returns of goods and materials \\npreviously purchased. iv. Sales Book to record the sales of the goods dealt in by the firm. v. Sale Returns Book to record the returns of goods made by the customers \\nsold to them earlier. vi. Bills Receivable Book to record the receipts of promissory notes or hundies \\nfrom various parties. vii.Bills Payable Book to record the issue of the promissory notes or hundies \\nto other parties. viii.Journal (proper) to record the transactions which cannot be recorded in \\nany of the seven books mentioned above.'), Document(page_content='It may be noted that in all the above cases the word \"Journal\" may be used for the \\nword \"book\". Advantages of Subsidiary Books \\nThe use of subsidiary books affords the undermentioned advantages: \\ni. Division of work: Since in the place of one journal there will be so many \\nsubsidiary books, the accounting work may be divided amongst a number of \\nclerks. ii. Specialization and efficiency: When the same work is allotted to a \\nparticular person over a period of time, he acquires full knowledge of it and \\nbecomes efficient in handling it. Thus the accounting work will be done \\nefficiently. iii.Saving of the time: Various accounting processes can be undertaken \\nsimultaneously because of the use of a number of books. This will lead to the \\nwork being completed quickly.'), Document(page_content='iv. Availability of information: Since a separate register or book is kept \\nfor each class of transactions, the information relating to each class of \\ntransaction be available at one place. v. Facility in checking: When the trial balance does not agree, the location \\nof the error or errors is facilitated by the existence of separate books. Even \\nthe commission of errors and frauds will be checked by the use of various \\nsubsidiary books. 4.2 DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUBSIDIARY BOOKS AND PRINCIPAL \\nBOOKS \\nThe books in which transactions are first recorded to enable further processing \\nare called subsidiary books. The ledger and the cash book are the principle books \\nsince they furnish information for preparation of the trial balance and financial \\nstatements. The following chart will help you in understanding the difference \\nbetween Subsidiary Books and Principal Books. The structure of financial books of accounts. Here is the text representation of the \\ncontent in the image, formatted in textbook language: \\nFinancial Books of Accounts \\nThe financial books of accounts are classified into two principal categories: \\n1. Principal Books \\n2. Subsidiary Books \\nPrincipal Books include: \\n➢·Cash Books, which can be further subdivided into: \\n➢·Simple Cash Book \\n➢·Cash Book with Discount Column \\n➢·Cash Book with Bank and Discount Column \\n➢·Petty Cash Book \\n➢·Ledger \\nSubsidiary Books are used for specific transactions and include: \\n➢·For credit purchases: Purchase Book \\n➢·For credit sales: Sales Book \\n➢·For credit purchase returns: Purchase Return Book \\n➢·For credit sales returns: Sales Return Book \\n➢·For bills receivable received: Bill Received Book \\n➢·For bills accepted: Bill Payable Book \\n➢·For transactions not recorded elsewhere: Journal Proper \\nEach of these books serves a specific purpose in the recording and management \\nof financial transactions for a business. Principal books are used for recording all \\nsignificant transactions involving cash and credit, while subsidiary books provide \\na detailed record of transactions that are specific to certain types of business \\nactivities \\nThis textbook-style text conveys the hierarchical structure and specific functions \\nof the various financial books of accounts as depicted in the image. 4.3 PURCHASES BOOK \\nTo record the credit purchases of goods dealt in or materials used in the business, \\na separate register called the Purchases Book or the Purchases Journal, is usually \\nmaintained by firms. It should be remembered that: \\ni. Cash purchases are not entered in this book since these will be entered in \\nthe cash book; and \\nii. Credit purchases of items other than goods or materials, such as office \\nfurniture or typewriters are journalised - they are not entered in the \\nPurchases Book. The particulars column is meant to record the name of the supplier and name of \\nthe articles purchased and the respective quantities. The amount in respect of \\neach article is entered in the details column. After totalling the various amounts \\nincluded in a single purchase, the amount for packing, or other charges is added \\nand the amount for trade discount is deducted. The net amount is entered in the \\namount column. The total in the amount column shows the total purchase made \\nin a period. POSTING THE PURCHASES BOOK \\nThe Purchases Book shows the names of the parties from whom goods have been \\npurchased on credit. These parties are now trade payables. Their accounts have to \\nbe credited for the respective amounts shown in the purchase book. The total of \\nthe amounts column shows the credit purchases made in a period. The amount is \\ndebited to the Purchase Account to indicate receipt of goods. In Illustration 1, the \\nPurchases Account is debited by ₹ 5,022, M/s. Brown & Co.'), Document(page_content='is credited by ₹ \\n3,042, The Paper Company by ₹1,800 and M/s. Verma Bros.'), Document(page_content='by ₹ 180 . The total \\nof the amounts put on the credit side equals the debit.'), Document(page_content='Thus the double entry is \\ncompleted. 4.4 SALES BOOK \\nThe Sales Book is a register specially kept to record credit sales of goods dealt in \\nby the firm, cash sales are entered in the Cash Book and not in the Sales Book. Credit sales of items other than the goods dealt in by the firm are not entered in \\nthe Sales Book rather they are journalised. The rules are the same as for the \\nPurchases Book.'), Document(page_content='Entries in the Sales Book are also made in the same manner as in the Purchase \\nBook. The particulars column will record the name of the customers concerned \\ntogether with particulars and quantities of the goods sold. For each item, the \\namount is entered in the details column; after totalling the amounts for one sale, \\ncharges for packing etc; are added and the trade discount, if any is deducted: the \\nnet amount is put in the outer column. The total of this column will show the \\ntotal credit sales for a period. POSTING THE SALES BOOK \\nThe names appearing in the Sales Book are of those parties which have received \\nthe goods. The accounts of the parties have to be debited with the respective \\namounts. The total of the Sales Book shows the credit sales made during the \\nperiod concerned; the a mount is credited to the Sales Account. In the Illustration \\n3, ₹ 1,92,100 is credited to the Sales Account; ₹39,600 is debited to M/s. Gupta \\nand Verma ₹40,000 to M/s Jain and Sons and ₹ \\n to M/s Mathur & Jain. The amount put on the credit side is equal to the total of the amount put on the \\ndebit side.'), Document(page_content='Thus, the double entry principle is followed correctly. 4.5 SALES RETURNS BOOK OR RETURNS INWARD BOOK \\n1,12, 500\\nIf customers frequently return the goods sold to them, it would be convenient to \\nrecord the returns in a separate book, which is named as the Sales Returns Book \\nor the Returns Inward Book. The rules of the book is similar to the Sales Book \\nand entries are also made in the same manner. The following, assumed figures, \\nwill illustrate this: \\nReturns Inward Book \\nJune 7, 2022: Sunil Bank & Co. was charged ₹37.80 for 6 copies of \"Double Entry \\nBookkeeping\" by T.S. Grewal at ₹7 each, after a trade discount of 10%, and \\nKailash & Co. was charged ₹3.50 for 1 copy of \"Business Methods\" by R.K. Gupta, \\ntotaling to an amount of ₹41.30. 4.6 PURCHASE RETURNS OR RETURNS OUTWARD BOOK \\nSuch a book conveniently records return of goods or material purchased to the \\nsuppliers. However, if the returns are not frequent, it may be sufficient to record \\nthe transaction in the journal. The rules of the Purchase Returns or Returns \\nOutward Book is similar to that of the Purchase Book; entries are also similarly \\nmade, as the illustration given below shows: \\nReturns Outward Book \\nJune 2, 2022: Premier Electric Co. was charged ₹175.00 for one 36\" Usha Ceiling \\nFan.'), Document(page_content='June 28, 2022: Mohan Electric Co. was charged a net amount of ₹135.00 for ten \\nIron Heaters, after a discount of ₹15.00 on the original total of ₹150.00.'), Document(page_content=\"The combined total for the transactions is ₹310.00. POSTING OF THE RETURN BOOKS \\nThe Sales Return Book will show the total of the returns made by customers. The \\ntotal of the sales returns is in reduction of the sales. Therefore, the amount may \\nbe debited to the Sales Account but, usually, a separate account called Returns \\nInward Account is opened and the total of the sales returns is debited to this \\naccounts. The customers who have returned the goods are credited with the \\nrespective amounts. It should be noted that on goods being received and accepted back from the \\ncustomers, a credit note is issued to the customers concerned. This shows the \\namount to be credited to the customer's account. Similarly, when goods are returned to suppliers they will issue the necessary \\ncredit note; also the firm returning the goods will issue a debit note to the \\nsupplier, indicating the amount for which the supplier account is being debited. The total of Returns Outwards Book shows the total purchase returns made. The \\namount can be credited to the Purchase Account, but in practice, it is credited to \\na separate account called Purchase Returns or Returns Outward Account. The \\nsuppliers whose names appear in the Book have received the goods, so their \\naccounts are debited. This is shown in the illustration given below: \\nBILLS RECEIVABLE BOOKS AND BILLS PAYABLE BOOKS \\nIf the firm usually receives a number of promissory notes or hundies, it would be \\nconvenient to record the transaction in a separate book called the Bills Receivable \\nBook. Similarly, if promissory notes or hundies are frequently issued, the Bills \\nPayable Book will be convenient. This will be discussed later.\"), Document(page_content='4.7 IMPORTANCE OF JOURNAL \\nStudents are now familiar with the journal. They also know that : \\ni.'), Document(page_content='Cash transactions are recorded in the cash book; \\nii. Credit purchases of goods or materials are recorded in the purchases book; \\niii.Credit sales of goods are recorded in the sales book; \\niv. Returns from customers are recorded in the sale returns book; and \\nv. Returns to suppliers are entered in the purchase returns book. Bill received or accepted transactions are entered in the bills receivable books or \\nthe bills payable books, if these are maintained. Apart from the transactions \\nmentioned above, there are other entries also which have to be recorded. For \\nthem the proper place is the journal. In fact, if there is no special book meant to \\nrecord a transaction, it is recorded in the journal (proper). The role of the journal \\nis thus restricted to the following types of entries: \\ni. Opening entries: When books are started for the new year, the opening \\nbalance of assets and liabilities are journalised. ii. Closing entries : At the end of the year, the profit and loss account is \\nprepared. For this purpose, the nominal accounts are transferred to profit \\nand loss account. This is done through journal entries called closing entries. iii.Rectification entries: If an error has been committed, it is rectified \\nthrough a journal entry. iv.'), Document(page_content=\"Transfer entries: If some amount is to be transferred from one account \\nto another, the transfer will be made through a journal entry. v. Adjusting entries : At the end of the year the amount of expenses or \\nincome may have to be adjusted for amounts received in advance or for \\namounts not yet settled in cash. Such an adjustment is also made through \\njournal entries. Usually, the entries pertain to the following: \\na. Outstanding expenses, i.e., expenses incurred but not yet paid; \\nb. Prepared expenses, i.e., expenses paid in advance for future period; \\nc. Interest on capital, i.e., the interest on proprietor's investment in the \\nbusiness; and \\nd. Depreciation, i.e., fall in the value of the assets used on account of wear \\nand tear. For above type of transactions/events, journal entries are necessary.\"), Document(page_content='vi. Entries on dishonour of Bills : If someone who accepted a promissory \\nnote (or bill) is not able to pay in on the due date, a journal entry will be \\nnecessary to record the nonpayment or dishonour of bills. vii.Miscellaneous entries : The following entries will also require \\njournalising: \\na) Credit purchase of items other than goods dealt in or materials required \\nfor production of goods e.g.'), Document(page_content='credit purchase of furniture or machinery will be \\njournalised. b) An allowance to be given to the customers or a charge to be made to them \\nafter the issue of the invoice. c) Receipt or issue of promissory notes, if separate bill books have not been \\nmaintained. d) If an amount becomes irrecoverable, say, because, of the customer \\nbecoming insolvent. e) Effects of accidents such as loss of property by fire.'), Document(page_content='f)\\nTransfer of net profit to capital \\naccount. UNIT 5 : CASH BOOK \\n5.1 CASH BOOK - A SUBSIDIARY BOOK AND A PRINCIPAL BOOK \\nCash transactions are straightaway recorded in the Cash Book and on the basis of \\nsuch a record, ledger accounts are prepared. Therefore, the Cash Book is a \\nsubsidiary book. But the Cash Book itself serves as the cash account and the bank \\naccount; the balances are entered in the trial balance directly. The Cash Book, \\ntherefore, is part of the ledger also. Hence, it has also to be treated as the \\nprincipal book. The Cash Book is thus both a subsidiary book and a principal \\nbook. 5.2 KINDS OF CASH BOOK \\nThe main Cash Book may be of the three types: \\n(i) Simple Cash Book; \\n(ii) Two-column Cash Book; \\n(iii) Three-column Cash Book. In addition to the main Cash Book, firms also generally maintain a petty cash \\nbook but that is purely a subsidiary book. SIMPLE CASH BOOK \\nSuch a cash book appears like an ordinary account, with one amount column on \\neach side. The left-hand side records receipts of cash and the right-hand side the \\npayments. Balancing: The cash book is balanced like other accounts. The total of receipts \\ncolumn is always greater than total of payments column. The difference is written \\non the credit side as \\'By balance \\n \\'. The totals are then entered in the two \\ncolumns opposite one another and then on the debit side the balance is written as \\n\"To Balance b/d\", to show cash balance in hand in the beginning of next period. DOUBLE-COLUMN CASH BOOK \\nIf along with column for \"Amount\" to record cash receipts and cash payments \\nanother column is added on each side to record the cash discount allowed or the \\ndiscount received, or a column on the debit side showing bank receipts and \\nanother column on the credit side showing payments through bank. It is a \\ndouble-column cash book. c/d\\nCash discount is an allowance which often accompanies cash payments. For \\nexample, if a customer owes ₹ 500 but is promised that \\n will be deducted if \\npayment is made within a certain period, the customer can clear his account by \\npaying promptly ₹ 490 . Cash received will be \\n and \\n will be the discount \\nfor the firm receiving the payment and discount is a loss; for the person making \\nthe payment it is a gain. Since cash discount is allowed only if cash is paid, it is \\nconvenient to add a column for discount allowed on the receipt side of the cash \\nbook and a column for discount received on the payment side of the cash book. Balancing: It should be noted that the discount columns are not balanced. They \\nare merely totalled. The total of the discount column on the receipts side shows \\ntotal discount allowed to customers and is debited to the Discount Account. The \\ntotal of the column on the payments side shows total discount received and is \\ncredited to the Discount Account. The Cash columns are balanced, as already \\nshown. The bank columns are also balanced and the balancing figure is called \\nbank balance. Thus a double column cash book should have two columns on each \\nside comprising of either cash and discount transaction or cash and bank \\ntransactions. In the cash column on the debit side, actual cash received is entered; the amount \\nof the discount allowed, if any, to the customer concerned is entered in the \\ndiscount column. Similarly, actual cash paid is entered in the cash column on the \\npayments side and discount received in the discount column. Also the bank \\ncolumn on the debit side records all receipts through bank and the same column \\non the credit side shows payment through bank. Note: The person who pays, is credited by both the cash paid by him and the \\ndiscount allowed to him. Similarly, the person to whom payment is made, is \\ndebited with both the amount paid and the discount allowed by him. THREE-COLUMN CASH BOOK \\nA firm normally keeps the bulk of its funds at a bank; money can be deposited \\nand withdrawn at will if it is current account. Probably payments into and out of \\nthe bank are more numerous than strict cash transactions. There is only a little \\ndifference between cash in hand and money at bank. Therefore, it is very \\nconvenient if, on each side in the cash book, another column is added to record \\ncash deposited at bank (on the receipt side of the cash book) and payments out of \\nthe bank (on the payment side of the cash book). For writing up the three-column cash book the under mentioned points should be \\nnoted: \\n1. While commencing a new business, the amount is written in the cash column \\nif cash is introduced and in the bank column if it is directly put into the bank \\nwith the description \"To Capital Account\". If a new cash book is being started \\n2%\\n₹490\\n₹10\\nfor an existing business, the opening balances are written as: \"To Balance b/\\nd\". 2.'), Document(page_content='All receipts are written on the receipts side, cash in the cash column and \\ncheques in the bank column. If any discount is allowed to the party paying the \\namount, the discount is entered in the discount column. In the particulars \\ncolumn the name of the account in respect of which payment has been \\nreceived is written.'), Document(page_content='3. All payments are written on the payments side, cash payment in the cash \\ncolumn and payments by cheques in the bank column. If some discount has \\nbeen received from the party receiving the payment, it is entered in the \\ndiscount column. 4. Contra Entries: Often cash is withdrawn from bank for use in the office. In \\nsuch a case the amount is entered in the bank column on the payments side \\nand also in the cash column on the receipts side. In the reverse case of cash \\nbeing sent to the bank, the amount is recorded in the bank column on the \\nreceipts side and in cash column on payment side. Against such entries, the \\nletter \" \\n \" should be written in the L.F column, to indicate that these are \\ncontra transaction and no further posting is required for them. Note: If initially cheques received are entered in the cash column and then sent \\nto the bank, the entry is as if cash has been sent to the bank. While recording contra entries, the basic but important rules should be followed - \\n(a) The Receiver                   Dr. The Giver                               Cr.'), Document(page_content='(b) All what comes in          Dr. All what goes out                 Cr.'), Document(page_content='e.g. where a Cash Book with separate columns for Bank Account is maintained. a) If cash is deposited in Bank Account, the Bank will be the Receiver, hence \\nit will be Debited and as the cash is going out, cash will be credited. b) If cash is withdrawn from the Bank Account, the Bank will be the Giver, \\nhence it will be Credited and, as the cash is coming in, cash will be Debited. 5. If some cheque sent to the bank is dishonoured, i.e., the bank is not able to \\ncollect the amount, it is entered in the bank column on the credit side with the \\nname of the concerned party in the particulars column. 6. If some cheque issued by the firm is not paid on presentation, it is entered in \\nthe Bank column on the debit side with the name of the party to whom the \\ncheque was given. C\\n7. In a rare case, a cheque received may be given to some other party, i.e., \\nendorsed. On receipt, it must have been entered in the bank column on the \\ndebit side; on endorsement the amount will be written in the bank column on \\nthe credit side. The advantages of such type of Cash Book are that - \\na) the Cash Account and the Bank Account are prepared simultaneously, \\ntherefore the double entry is completed in the Cash Book itself. Thus the \\ncontra entries can be easily cross-checked in Cash column in one side and the \\nBank column in the other side of the Cash Book. Also the chances of error are \\nreduced. b) the information regarding Cash in Hand and the Bank Balance can be \\nobtained very easily and quickly as there is no need to prepare Ledger of the \\nBank Account. In case of maintaining more than one Bank Account, separate column can be add \\nfor each Bank Account.'), Document(page_content='Transactions between these two or more Bank Accounts \\ncan be recorded and tallied with a much less effort. Suppose, there are two Bank Accounts namely PNB Current Account and SBI-\\nCash Credit Account. Now, if a cheque is issued from PNB cheque Book to SBI \\nAccount, the receiver - i.e., SBI Account will be debited and the giver i.e. the PNB \\nAccount shall be credited. Balancing: The discount columns are totalled but not balanced. The cash columns \\nare balanced exactly in the same manner as indicated for the simple cash book. The process is similar for balancing the bank columns also. It is possible, \\nhowever, that the bank may allow the firm to withdraw more than the amount \\ndeposited i.e., to have an overdraft, In such a case, the total of the bank column \\non the credit side is bigger than the one on the debit side. The difference is \\nwritten on the debit side as \"To Balance c/d.\" Then the totals are written on the \\ntwo sides opposite one another, the balance is then entered on the credit side as \\n\"By Balance b/d.\" \\nHowever, in usual cases debits into the bank will exceed the withdrawals or \\npayments out of the bank. Then the bank columns are balanced just like the cash \\ncolumns. 5.3 POSTING THE CASH BOOK ENTRIES \\nStudents would have seen that the cash columns in the cash book is actually the \\ncash account and the bank column is actually bank account. Also, the discount \\ncolumns are memorandum columns, meant only to provide information about \\nthe total discount allowed and total discount received. The debit side columns for cash and bank indicate receipts. Therefore, the \\namounts debited in the cash book should be put to the credit of the account in \\nrespect of which cash or cheque has been received. For instance, in the cash book \\ngiven above we see that ₹175 have been received for sale of goods. For posting, \\nthe amount is credited to the Sales Account as \"By Cash ₹175.\" We also see M/s. Warsi have paid ₹450 and also they have been allowed ₹ 35 as discount; thus \\nthey have discharged a debt of ₹485. In the account of M/s. Warsi, the posting is \\non the credit side as \\nBy Cash\\t\\n₹ 450 \\nBy Discount\\t ₹ 35 \\nor as:\\t  \\nBy Sundries\\t ₹ 485 \\nAll payments are recorded on the credit side. The particulars columns show on \\nwhat account payments have been made.'), Document(page_content='In the ledger accounts concerned the \\namount is put on the debit side. For example, the cash book shows that a cheque \\nfor ₹ 330 has been issued to M/s.'), Document(page_content='Ratan & Co. and also that they have allowed a \\ndiscount of ₹ 20; thus an obligation of \\n has been met. In the account of M/s.'), Document(page_content=\"Ratan & Co. the posting is: \\nTo Bank\\t\\n₹ 330 \\nTo Discount\\t  \\nOr\\t\\n \\nTo Sundries\\t ₹ 350 \\nThe rule thus develops: From the debit side of the cash book, credit the various \\naccounts with their respective amounts (including any discount that may have \\nbeen allowed); from the credit side of cash book, the posting will be to the debit \\nof the accounts mentioned in the particular column with their respective amounts \\n(including the discount which may have been received). As has been shown already, the total of the discount columns on the debit side is \\ndebited to the discount account; the total of the column discount on the credit \\nside is credited to the discount account. From the cash book given on the \\nprevious page ₹ 35 is debited and ₹ 20 be credited to the discount account. 5.4 PETTY CASH BOOK \\nIn the firm a number of small payments, such as for telegrams, taxi fare, cartage, \\netc., have to be made. If all these payments are recorded in the cash book, it will \\nbecome unnecessarily heavy. Also, the main cashier will be overburdened with \\nwork. Therefore, it is usual for firms to appoint a person as 'Petty Cashier' and to \\nentrust the task of making small payments say below ₹ 200, to him. Of course he \\n₹350\\nwill be reimbursed for the payments made. Later, on an analysis, the respective \\naccount may be debited. IMPREST SYSTEM OF PETTY CASH \\nIt is convenient to entrust a definite sum of money to the petty cashier in the \\nbeginning of a period and to reimburse him for payments made at the end of the \\nperiod. Thus, he will have again the fixed amount in the beginning of the new \\nperiod. Such a system is known as the imprest system of petty cash. The system is very useful specially if an analytical Petty Cash Book is used. The \\nbook has one column to record receipt of cash (which is only from the main \\ncashier) and other columns to record payments of various types. The total of the \\nvarious columns show why payments have been made and then the relevant \\naccounts can be debited.\"), Document(page_content='i. The amount fixed for petty cash should be sufficient for the likely small \\npayments for a relatively short period, say for a week or a fortnight. ii. The reimbursement should be made only when petty cashier prepares a \\nstatement showing total payments supported by vouchers, i.e., documentary \\nevidence and should be limited to the amount of actual disbursements. iii.The vouchers should be filed in order.'), Document(page_content='iv.'), Document(page_content='No payment should be made without proper authorisation. Also, payments \\nabove a certain specified limit should be made only by the main cashier. v. The petty cashier should not be allowed to receive any cash except for \\nreimbursement. In the petty cash book the extreme left-hand column records receipts of cash. The \\nmoney column towards the right hand side shows total payments for various \\npurposes; a column is usually provided for sundries to record infrequent \\npayments. The sundries column is analysed. At the end of the week or the \\nfortnight the petty cash book is balanced. The method of balancing is the same as \\nfor the simple cash book. ADVANTAGES OF PETTY CASH BOOK \\nThere are mainly three advantages: \\ni. Saving of time of the chief cashier; \\nii. Saving in labour in writing up the cash book and posting into the ledger; \\nand \\niii.Control over small payments. POSTING THE PETTY CASH BOOK \\nIn the ledger, a petty cash account is maintained, when an amount is given to the \\npetty cashier, the petty cash account is debited. Each week or forthnight, the total \\nof the payments made is credited to this account. The petty cash account will then \\nshow the balance in the hand of the cashier; on demand he should be able to \\nproduce it for counting. At the end of the period/year, the balance is shown in the \\nbalance sheet as part of cash balance. Of course, the payments must be debited to their respective accounts as shown by \\nthe petty cash book. For this two methods may be used: \\ni. From the petty cash book the total of the various columns may be directly \\ndebited to the concerned accounts; or \\nii. A journal entry may first be prepared on the basis of the petty cash book, \\ndebiting the accounts shown by the various analysis columns, and crediting \\nthe total of the payment of the petty cash accounts. Note: If the received cheque is endorsed to the other party on the same day, then \\nno entry is required.'), Document(page_content='However, in the above case posting has been done through \\ncash column as the endorsement is done on next day. 5.5 ENTRIES FOR SALE THROUGH CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS \\nNow-a-days sales through Credit/Debit Cards are issued by almost every Bank in \\nIndia either directly or with collaboration of some other agencies. HSBC Card, \\nSBI Card, BOB Card, ICICI Bank Card, HDFC Card and Andhra Bank Card are \\nsome of the popular Cards. The procedure for issuing Credit/Debit Cards are as follows - \\n1. A small Plastic Card, called Credit Card is issued by the bank to a prospective \\ncustomer, after verifying his credibility, which is generally measured by his \\nincome sources. Debit Card is issued by bank to a customer who has an \\naccount with the bank. Now a days ATM Card issued by the bank can also be \\nused as Debit Card. This card would contain an embossed 16 digit number \\nand also the name of the cardholder.'), Document(page_content='2.'), Document(page_content=\"Generally Bank charges annual subscription fees from the credit card holder. No fee is charged in case of Debit Card, though some banks charge a nominal \\nfee on Debit Card also. 3. When the Card holder intends to buy some goods or services through Credit \\nor Debit Card, the seller insert the customer's debit/credit card in the card \\nmachine and inputs the amount of sales and gives back to customers for \\nfeeding the password (i.e Personal Identification Number - PIN) for \\nauthorising the transactions. One copy of the receipt is given to the customer \\nand other once is kept by the sellier for its record.\"), Document(page_content=\"4. The seller sums up the different amounts sold like this and submits, generally \\neveryday, to his bank all the forms. The amount is credited by the bank to the \\nseller's account and debited to the account of the Bank or the company issuing \\nthe Credit/Debit Card. 5. The bank issuing the Card, charges commission for each such transaction, \\nwhich varies between \\n to \\n and is immediately debited to seller's bank \\naccount. 6. The bank sends a monthly statement to the card holder. In case of Debit Card \\nthe account is immediately debited to the card holder's account, whereas in \\ncase of Credit Card, card holder has to pay the amount in full or part. However, if not paid in full, the interest is charged. ACCOUNTING FOR CREDIT/DEBIT CARD SALE \\nFrom the seller's point of view, this type of sale is equivalent to a cash sale. Commission charged by the bank will be treated as selling expenses. The \\nfollowing journal entries will be made in the seller's books of accounts.\"), Document(page_content='1.'), Document(page_content='Bank \\n                                        Dr. To Sales Account \\n(Sales made through Credit/Debit Card) \\n2.

These various \\nunintentional errors can be committed at the stage of collecting financial \\ninformation/data on the basis of which financial statements are drawn or at the \\nstage of recording this information.'), Document(page_content=\"Also errors may occur as a result of \\nmathematical mistakes, mistakes in applying accounting policies, \\nmisinterpretation of facts, or oversight. To check the arithmetic accuracy of the \\njournal and ledger accounts, trial balance is prepared. If the trial balance does not \\ntally, then it can be said that there are errors in the accounts which require \\nrectification thereof. Some of these errors may affect the Trial Balance and some \\nof these do not have any impact on the Trial Balance although such errors may \\naffect the determination of profit or loss, assets and liabilities of the business. Illustrative Case of Errors and their Nature \\nWe have seen that after preparing ledger accounts a trial balance is taken out \\nwhere debit and credit balances are separately listed and totalled. If the totals of \\ndebit and credit do not agree, it is definite that there are some errors We shall \\nnow study the types of errors which may be committed and how they may be \\nrectified. For this purpose, the working of the following illustrative cases should \\nbe carefully seen. Illustrative Cases of Errors \\na) Wrong Entry: Let us start from the first phase of the accounting process. Where wrong amount of transactions and events are recorded in the \\nsubsidiary books, Journal Proper and Cash Book. b) Wrong casting of subsidiary books: Subsidiary books are totalled \\nperiodically and posted to the appropriate ledger accounts. There may be \\ntotalling errors. Totalling errors may arise due to wrong entry or simply these \\nmay be independent errors. c) In case of cash book, wrong castings will result in wrong calculation of \\nthe balance c/d. d) Wrong posting from subsidiary books: In this case, the wrong \\namount may be posted to the ledger account or the amount may posted to the \\nwrong side or to the wrong account. For example, purchases from A may be \\nposted to B's account. e) Wrong casting of ledger balances: Likewise Cash Book, any ledger \\naccount balance may be casted wrongly. Obviously wrong postings make the \\nbalance wrong; but that is not wrong casting of balances. Whenever there \\narises independent casting error as in the case of bank column in the Cash \\nBook of example (4), that is called wrong casting to ledger balances. 6.2 STAGES OF ERRORS \\nErrors may occur at any of the following stages of the accounting process: \\nAT THE STAGE OF RECORDING THE TRANSACTIONS IN JOURNAL \\nFollowing types of errors may happen at this stage: \\ni. Errors of principle, \\nii. Errors of omission, \\niii.Errors of commission. AT THE STAGE OF POSTING THE ENTRIES IN LEDGER \\ni. Errors of omission: \\na) Partial omission, \\nb) Complete omission. ii. Errors of commission: \\na) Posting to wrong account, \\nb) Posting on the wrong side, \\nc) Posting of wrong amount. AT THE STAGE OF BALANCING THE LEDGER ACCOUNTS \\ni. Wrong Totalling of accounts, \\nii. Wrong Balancing of accounts. AT THE STAGE OF PREPARING THE TRIAL BALANCE \\ni. Errors of omission, \\nii.\"), Document(page_content='Errors of commission: \\na) Taking wrong account, \\nb) Taking wrong amount, \\nc) Taking to the wrong side. Accounting errors can be categorized into four broad types: Errors of Principle, \\nErrors of Omission, Errors of Commission, and Compensating Errors. 6.3 TYPES OF ERRORS \\nBasically errors are of two types: \\n(a)Errors of principle: When a transaction is recorded in contravention of \\naccounting principles, like treating the purchase of an asset as an expense, it is \\nan error of principle. In this case, there is no effect on the trial balance since the \\namounts are placed on the correct side, though in a wrong account.'), Document(page_content='Suppose on \\nthe purchase of a computer, the office expenses account is debited; the trial \\nbalance will still agree. (b)Clerical errors: These errors arise because of mistake committed in the \\nordinary course of the accounting process. These are of three types: \\ni. Errors of Omission: If a transaction is completely or partially omitted from \\nthe books of account, it will be a case of omission. Examples would be: not \\nrecording a credit purchase of furniture or not posting an entry into the \\nledger. ii. Errors of Commission: If an amount is posted in the wrong account or it is \\nwritten on the wrong side or the totals are wrong or a wrong balance is \\nstruck, it will be a case of \"errors of commission.\" \\niii.Compensating Errors: If the effect of errors committed cancel out, the \\nerrors will be called compensating errors. The trial balance will agree.'), Document(page_content=\"Suppose an amount of ₹10 received from  is not credited to his account and \\nA\\nthe total of the sales book is ₹ 10 in excess. The omission of credit to A's \\naccount will be made up by the increased credit to the Sales Account. From another point of view, error may be divided into two categories: \\na) Those that affect the trial balance - because of these errors, trial balance \\ndoes not agree; these are the following: \\ni. Wrong casting of the subsidiary books.\"), Document(page_content='ii. Wrong balancing of an account. iii.Posting an amount on the wrong side. iv. Posting the wrong amount. v. Omitting to post an amount from a subsidiary book. vi. Omitting to post the totals of subsidiary book. vii.Omitting to write the cash book balances in the trial balance. viii. Omitting to write the balance of an account in the trial balance. ix. Writing a balance in wrong column of the trial balance. x. Totalling the trial balance wrongly. b) The errors that do not affect the trial balance are the following: \\ni. Omitting an entry altogether from the subsidiary book.'), Document(page_content='ii. Making an entry with the wrong amount in the subsidiary book. iii.Posting an amount in a wrong account but on the correct side, e.g., an \\namount to be debited to  is debited to , the trial balance will still agree. Classification of Accounting Errors \\nIn accounting, errors can be categorized into two main types: Error of Principal \\nand Clerical Errors. These errors have different implications on the trial balance, \\nwhich is a statement that lists the balances of all ledger accounts to verify the \\narithmetic accuracy of the books. 1. Error of Principal: This occurs when a transaction is recorded against the \\nfundamental principles of accounting, such as treating revenue expenses as \\ncapital expenditure or vice versa, or recording the sale of a fixed asset as an \\nA\\nB\\nordinary sale. Despite this error, the Trial Balance will still agree because the \\nentries are made on both sides of accounts.'), Document(page_content='2. Clerical Errors: These are mistakes made by a bookkeeper in the \\naccounting process and are further divided into: \\na. Errors of Omission: When a transaction is not recorded at all, it is an error \\nof omission. Within this category: \\nIf an entry is completely omitted from the subsidiary books, the Trial Balance \\nwill agree. If posting to the ledger account from the subsidiary books is omitted, the \\nTrial Balance will not agree. b. Errors of Commission: These include: \\nWriting the wrong amount in the subsidiary books, which will still result in \\nthe Trial Balance agreeing. Wrong casting (tallying) of the subsidiary books, posting the wrong amount \\nin the ledger, or posting an amount on the wrong side of an account will \\nresult in the Trial Balance not agreeing. c. Compensating Errors: These are multiple errors that counterbalance each \\nother, resulting in no discrepancy in the Trial Balance. Understanding the nature of these errors is crucial for accountants, as it \\nhelps in locating them and taking appropriate corrective measures. Identifying whether the Trial Balance agrees or not can be an initial step in \\nerror detection. This text provides a structured explanation of accounting errors based on their  \\n6.4 STEPS TO LOCATE ERRORS \\nEven if there is only a very small difference in the trial balance, the errors leading \\nto it must be located and rectified. A small difference may be the result of a \\nnumber of errors.'), Document(page_content='The following steps will be useful in locating errors: \\ni. The two columns of the trial balance should be totalled again. If in place of \\na number of accounts, only one amount has been written in the trial balance \\nthe list of such accounts should be checked and totalled again. List of Trade \\nreceivables is the example from which Trade receivable balance is derived. ii.'), Document(page_content='It should be seen that the cash and bank balances have been written in the \\ntrial balance. iii.The exact difference in the trial balance should be established. The ledger \\nshould be gone through again; it is possible that a balance equal to the \\ndifference has been omitted from the trial balance. The difference should also \\nbe halved; it is possible that balance equal to half the difference has been \\nwritten in the wrong column. iv. The ledger accounts should be balanced again. v. The casting of subsidiary books should be checked again, especially if the \\ndifference is ₹ 1 , ₹ 100 etc. vi.'), Document(page_content='If the difference is very big, the balance in various accounts should be \\ncompared with the corresponding accounts in the previous period. If the \\nfigures differ materially, those cases should be further scrutinised; it is \\npossible that an error has been committed. Suppose the sales account for the \\ncurrent year shows a balance of \\n whereas it was ₹ 36,45,000 last \\nyear; it is possible that there is an error in the Sales Account. vii.Postings of the amounts equal to the difference or half the difference \\nshould be checked. It is possible that an amount has been omitted to be \\nposted or has been posted on the wrong side. viii.If there is still a difference in the trial balance, a complete checking will be \\nnecessary. The posting of all the entries including the opening entry should \\nbe checked.'), Document(page_content='It may be better to begin with the nominal accounts. 6.5 RECTIFICATION OF ERRORS \\nErrors should never be corrected by overwriting. The correction should be made \\nby making another suitable entry, called as rectification entry. In fact the \\nrectification of an error depends on at which stage it is detected. An error can be \\ndetected at any one of the following stages: \\na) Before preparation of Trial Balance. b) After Trial Balance but before the final accounts are drawn. c) After final accounts, i.e., in the next accounting period. 6.5.1 Before preparation of Trial Balance \\nThere are some errors which affect one side of an account or which affect more \\nthan one account in such a way that it is not possible to pass a complete \\nrectification entry. In other words, there are some errors which can be corrected, \\nif detected at this stage, by making rectification statement in the appropriate \\nside(s) of concerned account(s). It is important to note here that such errors may \\ninvolve only one account or more than one account. Read the following \\nillustrations: \\n₹32,53, 000\\ni. The sales book for November is undercast by ₹ 200. The effect of this \\nerror is that the Sales Account has been credited short by ₹ 200. Since the \\naccount is posted by the total of the sales book, there is no error in the \\naccounts of the customers since they are posted with amounts of individual \\nsales. Hence only the Sales Accounts is to be corrected. This will be done by \\nmaking an entry for ₹ 200 on the credit side: \"By undercasting of Sales Book \\nfor November ₹ 200\". ii. While posting the discount column on the debit side of the cash book the \\ndiscount of ₹ 10 allowed to Ramesh has not been posted. There is no error in \\nthe cash book, the total of discount column presumably has been posted to \\nthe discount account on the debit side. The error is in not crediting Ramesh \\nby ₹ 10 . This should now be done by the entry \"By omission of posting of \\ndiscount on ----- ₹10\". iii.₹ 200 received from Ram has been entered by mistake on the debit side of \\nhis account. Since the cash book seems to have been correctly written, the \\nerror is only in the account of Ram - he should have been credited and not \\ndebited by ₹ 200 . Not only the wrong debit is to be removed but also a credit \\nof ₹ 200 is to be given. This can be done now by entering ₹ 400 on the credit \\nside of his account. The entry will be \"By Posting on the wrong side - ₹ 400\". iv. ₹ 50 was received from Mahesh and entered on the debit side of the cash \\nbook but was not posted to his account. By the error, which affects only the \\naccount of Mahesh, ₹ 50 has been omitted from the credit side of his \\naccount. The rectification will be by the entry. \"By Omission of posting on the \\n₹ 50.\" \\nv. ₹ 51 paid to Mohan has been posted as ₹15 to the debit of his account. Mohan has been debited short by ₹ 36 . The rectifying entry is \"To mistake in \\nposting on ₹ 36 \". vi. Goods sold to Ram for ₹1,000 was wrongly posted from sales day book to \\nthe debit of purchase account. Ram has however been correctly debited. Here \\nthe error affects two accounts, viz., purchases account and sales account but \\nwe cannot pass a journal entry for its rectification because both the accounts \\nneed to be credited. The rectification will be done by the entry \"By wrong \\nposting on \\n \" in the credit of purchases account and also \"By omission \\nof posting on - ₹ 1,000\" in the credit sales account. vii.Bills receivable from Mr. A of ₹ 500 was posted to the credit of Bills \\npayable Account and also credited to A account. Here also although two \\naccounts are involved we cannot pass a complete journal entry for \\nrectification. The rectification will be done by the entry \"To wrong posting on \\n₹ 500\" in debit of Bills payable Account and also \"To omission of posting on \\n₹ 500 \" in the debit of Bills Receivable Account. ₹1,000\\nviii.Goods purchased from Vinod for ₹ 1,000 was wrongly credited to Vimal \\naccount by ₹ 100. Again we cannot pass a complete journal entry for \\nrectification even though two accounts are involved. The rectification will be \\ndone by the entry \"To wrong posting on \\n \" in the debit of Vimal account \\nand \"By omission of posting on \\n \" in the credit of Vinod account. Thus, from the above illustrations, it is clear that the general rule of errors \\naffecting two accounts can be corrected by a journal entry does not hold true \\nalways. 6.5.2 After Trial Balance but before Final Accounts \\nThe method of correction of error indicated so far is appropriate when the errors \\nhave been located before the end of the accounting period. After the corrections, \\nthe trial balance will agree. Sometimes the trial balance is artificially made to \\nagree despite of errors by opening a suspense account and putting the difference \\nin the trial balance to the account - the suspense account will be debited if the \\ntotal of the credit column in the trial balance exceeds the total of the debit \\ncolumn and vice as versa. One must note that such agreement of the trial balance is not real.'), Document(page_content='Effort must be \\nmade to locate the errors.'), Document(page_content='The rule of rectifying errors detected at this stage is simple. Those errors for \\nwhich complete journal entries were not possible in the earlier stage of \\nrectification (i.e., before trial balance) can now be rectified by way of journal \\nentry(s) with the help of suspense account, for it these errors which gave rise to \\nthe suspense account in the trial balance. The rectification entry for other type of \\nerror i.e. error affecting more than one account in such a way that a complete \\njournal entry is possible for its rectification, can be rectified in the same way as in \\nthe earlier stage (i.e. before trial balance). In a nutshell, it can be said that each and every error detected at this stage can \\nonly be corrected by a complete journal entry. Those errors for which journal \\nentries were not possible at the earlier stage will now be rectified by a journal \\nentry(s), the difference or the unknown side is being taken care of by suspense \\naccount. Those errors for which entries were possible even at the first stage will \\nnow be rectified in the same way. Suppose, the sales book for November, 2022 is casted short by ₹100; as a \\nconsequence the trial balance will not agree. The credit column of the trial \\nbalance will be ₹100 short and a Suspense Account will be credited by ₹100. To \\nrectify the error the Sales Account will be credited (to increase the credit to the \\nright figure. Now one error remains, the Suspense Account must be closed by \\ndebiting the Suspense Account. The entry will be: \\n₹100\\n₹1,000\\nDebit entry of ₹100 to Suspense Account and credit entry of ₹100 to Sales \\nAccount to correct the understatement in the sales book for November 2022. 6.5.3 Correction in the next Accounting Period \\nRectification of errors discussed so far assumes that it was carried out before the \\nbooks were closed for the concerned year. However, sometimes, the rectification \\nis carried out in the next year, carrying forward the balance in the Suspense \\nAccount or even transferring it to the Capital Account. Suppose, the Purchase \\nBook was cast short by ₹1,000 in December, 2022 and a Suspense Account was \\nopened with the difference in the trial balance. If the error is rectified next year \\nand the entry passed is to debit Purchase Account (and credit Suspense Account), \\nit will mean that the Purchases Account for year 2023 will be \\n more than \\nthe amount relating to year 2023 and thus the profit for year 2023 will be less \\nthan the actual for that year. Thus, correction of errors in this manner will \\'falsify\\' \\nthe Profit and Loss Account. To avoid this, correction of all amounts concerning nominal accounts, i.e., \\nexpenses and incomes should be through a special account styled as \"Prior Period \\nItems\" or \"Profit and Loss Adjustment Account\". The balance in the account \\nshould be transferred to the Profit and Loss Account. However, these Prior \\nPeriod Items should be charged after deriving the profit of the current year. \\'Prior \\nPeriod items\\' are material income or expenses which arise in the current period \\nas a result of errors or omissions in the preparation of the financial statements of \\none or more prior periods. Prior Period Items should be separately disclosed in \\nthe current statement of profit and loss together with their nature and amount in \\na manner that their impact on current period profit or loss can be perceived. ₹1,000\\nBANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENT \\n1.INTRODUCTION \\nBanks are essential institutions in a modern society.'), Document(page_content='With the increase in volume \\nof trade, commerce and business, business entities faced difficulty in transacting \\nin cash for each business activity.'), Document(page_content='They discovered that dealing through bank, on \\nregular basis, would be the better and safer option and finally large business \\nentities switched over to banking transactions instead of dealing in cash. Now-a-\\ndays, most of the transactions of the business are done through bank whether it is \\na receipt or a payment. Rather, it is legally necessary to operate the transactions \\nthrough bank after a certain limit. A Bank accepts from people, in general, deposits in various forms, and lends \\nfunds to those who need; it also invests some funds in profitable investments. Thus, money which would have been otherwise idle is put to use and is made \\navailable to those who need it. Those who deposit the money are able to withdraw \\nit according to the settled terms and conditions. Apart from receiving deposits \\nfrom and handling cash transactions on behalf of its customers, the bank also \\nrenders some other useful services as indicated below: \\n1. The bank discounts promissory notes or hundies, i.e., it enables a \\ncustomer to receive the cash before the due date in consideration of a small \\ncharge called discount. 2.'), Document(page_content='The bank allows overdraft to its good customers so that they can make \\npayments even when they do not have sufficient balance in the bank.

The bank also issues letter of credit or travellers' cheque to facilitate \\ncommerce or travel. 10.The bank also provides international banking services such as currency \\nexchange, remittance from abroad, cross country payments, foreign letters of \\ncredit, export and import credit, etc. 2.BACKGROUND \\nIn the past, many corporate frauds have incurred by the companies through \\nmanipulating entries either in bank statements or in cash book.\"), Document(page_content='For e.g.'), Document(page_content=\"-A \\ncompany's financial statement may present incorrect bank balance to mislead the \\nstakeholders. Such kind of instances has made reconciliation of bank and cash \\nbalances an integral part of internal control maintained by management. Over the period, reconciling the accounts became an important activity for \\nbusinesses because it gives an opportunity to check for fraudulent activity \\nhappening in the organization and helps to prevent the financial statement \\nerrors. Reconciliation is typically done at regular intervals, such as monthly or \\nquarterly, as part of normal accounting procedures, however, frequency is largely \\ndependent on the size of organization and the number of transactions that occur. 3.BANK PASS BOOK \\nBank pass book is merely a copy of the customer's account in the books of a bank. The bank either sends periodical statements of account or gives a pass book to its \\ncustomer in which all deposits and withdrawals made by the customer during the \\nparticular period is recorded. Both represent almost a copy of the ledger account \\nof the customer in the books of the bank. Thus, it is the bank's way of keeping the \\ncustomers informed of the entries made in his account. It is the customer's duty \\nto check the entries and immediately inform the bank of any error that he may \\nnotice. These days, customers can easily access their bank statement online any \\ntime as facilitated by Net Banking. The form of the pass book is given below: \\n                                       PASS BOOK \\nMessers……………………………… \\nin account with \\nPunjab National Bank \\nDaryaganj, New Delhi-110002 \\nAccount number - \\nTransaction Period - \\nThe bank statement of account also has a similar form except that it is on loose \\nsheets or can be in an online format. The bank itself sends the statements to \\ncustomers but if the customer wants to maintain a pass book then it is their duty \\nto send the pass book to the bank periodically so that it is updated by the bank. These days, many banks' ATMs have the automated machines where one can get \\nthe passbook updated without any manual intervention and without visiting the \\nbranch of the bank. Business houses should also obtain at the end of the year a certificate from the \\nbank duly stamped and signed, showing the balance which, the firm carries with \\nthe bank as of date. The bank balance shown in the passbook is known as pass \\nbook balance for reconciliation purpose. The credit balance as per pass book at a \\nparticular point of time is the deposit made by the customer while debit balance \\nas per pass book is the overdraft balance for the customer (i.e. customer owes to \\nbank). Students may note here that the nature of balance shown by passbook (in the \\nbooks of bank) and cash book (in the books of customer) is quite different. The \\ndebit balance in the pass book represents the credit balance as per the cash book \\nand vice-versa because the business enterprise treats the bank as a debtor/Trade \\nreceivable and bank treats the business enterprise as a creditor/Trade payable. 4. BANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENT \\nTo reconcile means to identify or find out the difference between two different \\nsources and eliminating that difference. Whenever we deposit or withdraws \\nmoney from banks, it is always recorded at two places:- \\nUnderstanding the Components of Financial Reconciliation \\nIn financial accounting, reconciliation involves comparing two sets of records to \\nensure they are in agreement and that figures are accurate and consistent. Two \\ncrucial elements involved in the reconciliation process are: \\n1. Bank Column of the Cash Book: This refers to the section in the cash book \\nmaintained by the customer that records all banking transactions, including \\ndeposits and withdrawals. It represents the customer's perspective of all \\nbanking transactions.\"), Document(page_content='2. Bank Statement (Pass Book): This is the record provided by the bank, \\ndetailing the transactions processed through the customer\\'s account. It is the \\nbank\\'s version of the customer\\'s account activity. The reconciliation process involves aligning the bank column of the cash book \\nwith the bank statement to identify any discrepancies between the two records. This is an essential practice to ensure that the records reflect the true amount of \\ncash available and to detect any possible errors or inconsistencies. The cash book is maintained by the person having the bank account whereas the \\nbank statement is prepared by the bank. Therefore, the balance in both the books \\nshould be equal and opposite in nature. For eg:- if Mr. A deposited ₹ 1,00,000 in \\nhis bank account it will be recorded on the Dr. side of his cash book, but for the \\nbank it\\'s a receipt so it will be recorded as a Cr. Entry in the bank statement or \\nthe pass book. But most of the times these two balances do not match. The reasons for \\ndifference in balances can be many and are explained later in this chapter. It is \\npossible to eliminate this difference by matching all the facts and figures of the \\ntwo statements. The process of eliminating this difference and bringing the two \\nstatements in line with each other is known as \"Reconciliation\", and the \\nstatement which reconciles the bank balance as per cash book with the balance as \\nper the pass book by showing all the causes of difference is known as \"BANK \\nRECONCILIATION STATEMENT\". 5.IMPORTANCE OF BANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENT \\nBank reconciliation statement is a very important tool for internal control of cash \\nflows. It helps in detecting errors, frauds and irregularities occurred, if any, at the \\ntime of passing entries in the cash book or in the pass book, whether intentionally \\nor unintentionally. Since frauds can be detected on the preparation of bank \\nreconciliation statement therefore accountants are careful while preparing and \\nmaintaining the records of the business enterprise. Hence it works as an \\nimportant mechanism of internal control. Following are the salient features of \\nbank reconciliation statement: \\ni. The reconciliation will bring out any errors that may have been committed \\neither in the cash book or in the pass book; \\nii. Any undue delay in the clearance of cheques will be shown up by the \\nreconciliation; \\niii.A regular reconciliation discourages the accountant of the bank from \\nembezzlement of funds. There have been many cases when the cashiers \\nmerely made entries in the cash book but never deposited the cash in the \\nbank; they were able to get away with it only because of lack of reconciliation. iv. It helps in finding out the actual or true position of the bank balance by \\nincorporating the effect of any uncleared funds as well. v.'), Document(page_content='It will ensure accounting of all the financial transactions incurred by the \\ncompany during a particular financial year. CAUSES OF DIFFERENCE \\nThe difference in the both balances (bank balance as per cash book and pass \\nbook) may arise because of the following reasons:- \\n1. TIMING:- Sometimes a transaction is recorded at two different times in \\ncash book and the pass book.'), Document(page_content='This may happen in the following cases:- \\n•\\nMr. A has issued a cheque to PQR Itd., now it will be recorded in his cash \\nbook immediately but the bank will recognize this transaction only when \\nthe same cheque will be presented to it by PQR Itd. •\\nSimilarly for PQR Ltd, entry in the cash book will be made immediately as \\nthe cheque is received from Mr. A but the bank account will be credited \\nwhen it collects money in respect of that cheque.'), Document(page_content='2. TRANSACTIONS:- There are various transactions which the bank \\ncarries out by itself without intimating the customer. For e.g.:- interest \\nreceived on a savings bank account, it will be credited by the bank \\nimmediately but the entry in the cash book will be made only when the \\ncustomer comes to know about it, which is usually at a later stage. Similar \\nis the case with Bank charges (which are debited from the customer \\naccount by bank).'), Document(page_content='3. ERRORS:- Mistakes or errors made in preparing the accounts either by \\nthe bank or the customer can also result in disagreement of the two \\nstatements. For e.g.'), Document(page_content=\"omission of cheques issued. For this reason \\nrectification of errors is required to be done in both the statements before \\npreparing any Bank Reconciliation Statement. SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT FREQUENTLY CAUSE A DIFFERENCE:- \\nWhen the bank balance as per Cash Book is greater, reasons include cheques \\ndeposited but not cleared, interest and expenses charged by the bank, direct \\npayments by the bank, and dishonour of a bill discounted with the bank. Conversely, when the bank balance as per Pass Book is greater, it can be due to \\ncheques issued but not presented for payment, interest allowed by the bank, \\ninterest and dividends collected by the bank, direct payments into the bank by a \\ncustomer, and bills collected by the bank on behalf of the customer. Above each scenario is explained in detail below along with examples: \\ni. Cheques issued but not presented for payment: The entry in the \\ncash book is made immediately on issue of cheque but naturally entry will be \\nmade by the bank only when the cheque is presented for payment. Thus there \\nwill be a gap of some days between the entry in the cash book and in the pass \\nbook. ii. Cheques deposited with the bank but not cleared: As soon as \\ncheques are sent to the bank (i.e. deposited with bank), entries are made on \\nthe debit side of the bank column of the cash book. But usually banks credit \\nthe customer's account only when they have received the payment from the \\nbank concerned- in other words, when the cheques have been cleared. Again, \\nthere will be some time gap between the deposit of the cheques and the credit \\ngiven by the bank. iii.Interest allowed by bank : If the bank has allowed interest to the \\ncustomer, the entry will normally be made in the customer's account and \\nlater shown in the pass book. The customer usually comes to know the \\namount of the interest by pursuing the pass book and only then he makes \\nrelevant entry in the cash book. iv. Interest and expenses charged by the bank: Like (iii) above, the \\ninterest charged by the bank and the amount of the bank charges are entered \\nin the customer account and later in the pass book. The customer makes the \\nrequired entries only after he sees the pass book or bank statement. These are \\ndebited to customer account by bank therefore till such entry is passed in \\ncash book, bank balance as per pass book is less than bank balance as per \\ncash book. v. Interest and dividends collected by the bank: Sometimes \\ninvestments are left with the bank in the safe custody; the bank itself sees to \\nit that the interest or the dividend is collected on the due dates. Entries are \\nmade as indicated in (iii) above.\"), Document(page_content=\"vi. Direct payments by the bank: The bank may be given standing \\ninstructions for certain payments such as insurance premium, equated \\nmonthly installments of loan (EMIs). In these cases also, the customer comes \\nto know of the payment only after viewing the pass book or bank statement. The entries in the pass book and in the cash book may thus be on different \\ndates. vii.Direct payment into the bank by a customer: If such a payment is \\nreceived by the bank, it will be entered in the customer's account and also in \\nthe pass book; the account holder may come to know of the amount only \\nwhen he sees the pass book. (e.g. Customers' these days prefers using \\nbanking facilities like NEFT, RTGS to transfer funds online) \\nviii.Dishonour of a bill discounted with the bank: If the bank is not \\nable to receive payment on promissory notes discounted by it, it will debit the \\ncustomer's account together with the charges it may have incurred. The \\ncustomer will naturally make the entry only when he sees the pass book..\"), Document(page_content=\"ix. Bills collected by the bank on behalf of the customer: If goods are \\nsold, the documents may be sent through the bank. If the bank is able to \\ncollect the amount, it will credit the customer's account. The customer may \\nmake the entry only on receiving the pass book. All these timing differences will lead to difference in balances as shown by the \\ncash book and the pass book. Following is the table summarising in brief the timings of different transactions: \\nPayment by the account holder through issuing a cheque is recorded in the cash \\nbook at the time of issuing the cheque and in the pass book when the cheque is \\npresented for payment or clearing. Receipt by the account holder through a cheque is recorded in the cash book \\nwhen the cheque is deposited and in the pass book upon collection of the amount \\nfrom the issuing party. Collection of bills/cheque directly on behalf of the account holder is recorded in \\nthe cash book when it is entered in the pass book notice and in the pass book \\nwhen the amount is collected by the bank. Direct payment to the third party on behalf of the account holder is recorded in \\nthe cash book when it is entered in the pass book notice and in the pass book \\nwhen the bank pays the amount. Dishonour of cheque/bills receivable is recorded in the cash book when the entry \\nis posted in the pass book notice and in the pass book when the cheque is \\ndishonoured. Bank charges levied by the bank are recorded in the cash book when the entry is \\nposted in the pass book notice and in the pass book when the bank levies the \\ncharges. Interest and dividend credited by the bank are recorded in the cash book when \\nthe entry is posted in the pass book notice and in the pass book when the interest \\nor dividend is allowed or collected by the bank. Interest debited by the bank is recorded in the cash book when the entry is posted \\ninto the pass book notice and in the pass book when the bank charges the \\ninterest. x. Errors: While recording the entries errors can occur both in the cash \\nbook and in the pass book. A bank rarely makes an error but if it does, the \\nbalance in the pass book will naturally differ from cash book. Similarly if any \\nerror is committed in the cash book then it's balance will be different from \\nthat of the pass book. Some of the errors include commission of entry, recording of an incorrect \\namount, recording of entry on the wrong side of the book, wrong totalling of the \\naccount or wrong balancing of the book and recording of transactions of other \\nparty. 6. PROCEDURE FOR RECONCILING THE CASH BOOK BALANCE \\nWITH THE PASS BOOK BALANCE \\nBefore proceeding further, students must understand that 'Dr. balance as per \\ncash book' means deposits in the bank or cash at bank or \\n. balance as per pass \\nbook. Similarly, 'Cr. balance as per cash book' means excess amount over \\ndeposits withdrawn by the account holder or overdraft balance or Dr. balance as \\nper pass book. It means that students can be required to start bank reconciliation from any of \\nthe following four balances as may be given in the question: \\nDr. balance as per cash book \\nCr.\"), Document(page_content=\"balance as per cash book \\nDr. balance as per pass book \\n. balance as per pass book \\nCr\\nCr\\nWhile doing reconciliation, the following types of problems can be given:- \\nThe types of problems encountered in the bank reconciliation process. The \\nflowchart is divided into two main categories based on whether the causes of \\ndifferences between the cash book and bank statement are known or not. Here is \\na textbook-style description of the content: \\nTypes of Problems in Bank Reconciliation \\nBank reconciliation problems can be broadly categorized based on the availability \\nof information regarding the causes of discrepancies between the bank statement \\nand the cash book. These are: \\n1. When Causes of Difference are Given \\nReconciliation without adjusting cash book: This approach is taken when the \\ndiscrepancies are identified, and the reconciliation is performed without making \\nany adjustments to the cash book. Reconciliation after adjusting cash book: In this scenario, once the differences are \\nidentified, appropriate adjustments are made to the cash book before the \\nreconciliation is completed. 2. When Causes of Difference are Not Given \\nReconciliation without adjusting cash book: This method involves attempting to \\nreconcile the two records without the knowledge of specific discrepancies, and \\nwithout making alterations to the cash book. Reconciliation after adjusting cash book: This approach entails making educated \\nadjustments to the cash book based on typical reconciling items, even when the \\nexact causes of the discrepancies are not known. Each of these methods has its own applications and is chosen based on the \\nspecific circumstances of the reconciliation process. Understanding the nature of \\nthe discrepancies is essential for an accurate and effective bank reconciliation. This text explains the different approaches to solving problems in bank \\nreconciliation, tailored to reflect the structure and information presented in the \\nflowchart. When causes of differences are known then students can start reconciliation \\nby taking any of the balance stated above and proceed further with the causes. Given the causes of disagreement, the balance of the other book can be either \\nmore or less on account of the said causes. If the balance of the other book is \\nmore on account of the said causes, then add the amount. If the balance of the \\nother book is less on account of the said causes, then subtract the amount. For example, if the reconciliation is initiated with Dr. balance as per the cash \\nbook and there is a cheque deposited in the bank but not yet cleared, then on \\naccount of non-clearance of the cheque, the \\n. balance of the pass book would be \\nless. In this case, the amount of cheque should be subtracted from the cash book \\nCr\\nbalance to arrive at the balance as per the pass book. Similarly, after making all \\nthe adjustments the balance as per the other book is obtained. It is necessary to \\nnote here that if a student starts from debit balance of cash book and after all \\nadjustments the balance arrived is positive then it is known as \\n. balance as per \\nthe pass book and if the balance is negative then it is said to be Dr. balance as per \\nthe pass book and vice-versa. But if causes of differences are not known then one has to compare the debit \\nentries of cash book with the credit entries of the pass-book and vice-versa. The \\nentries, which do not tally in the course, are the causes of difference in the \\nbalances of both the books. Once the causes are located their effects on both the \\nbooks are analysed and then reconciliation statement is prepared to arrive at the \\nactual bank balance. In this procedure students, should also take into care that whether opening \\nbalance of both the books at particular point of time from where the books are \\ncompared, tallies or not. If opening balances are not same then unticked items \\nare divided into two categories i.e., one relating to reconciliation of opening \\nbalance and other relating to reconciliation of closing balance. 7.METHODS OF BANK RECONCILIATION \\nThere are following two methods of reconciling the bank balances: \\n7.1 Bank Reconciliation Statement without Preparation of adjusted \\nCash-Book \\nFor reconciliation purposes students can take any of the four balances as the \\nstarting point and can proceed further with the causes of differences. Based on the earlier explanation the following table has been prepared for \\nstudent's ready reference when reconciliation is done on the basis of 'Balance' \\npresentation.\"), Document(page_content=\"The final balance, which will come after addition and subtraction, \\nwill be the balance as per the other book (on the opposite side). A cheque deposited but not cleared results in a subtraction from the favorable \\nbalance as per the cash-book and an addition to the unfavorable balance. For a cheque issued but not presented to the bank, add to the favorable balance \\nand subtract from the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. When a cheque is directly deposited in the bank by a customer, add to the \\nfavorable balance and subtract from the unfavorable balance as per the cash-\\nbook. Income directly received by the bank, like interest, means adding to the favorable \\nbalance and subtracting from the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Cr\\nExpenses directly paid by the bank result in subtracting from the favorable \\nbalance and adding to the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Bank charges levied by the bank mean subtraction from the favorable balance \\nand addition to the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Locker rent levied by the bank also leads to subtraction from the favorable \\nbalance and addition to the unfavorable balance in the cash-book. A wrong debit in the cash book means subtracting from the favorable balance and \\nadding to the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Conversely, a wrong credit in the cash book requires adding to the favorable \\nbalance and subtracting from the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Wrong debits or credits in the pass book will have the opposite effect: a wrong \\ndebit means adding to the favorable balance and subtracting from the \\nunfavorable balance, while a wrong credit means subtracting from the favorable \\nbalance and adding to the unfavorable balance as per the pass-book. Undercasting or overcasting on either side of the bank account in the cash book \\nwill require adjustments: add for undercasting and subtract for overcasting to \\ncorrect the favorable balance and do the opposite for the unfavorable balance as \\nper the cash-book. For a bill receivable collected directly by the bank, add to the favorable balance \\nand subtract from the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. Interest on bank overdraft charged means subtracting from the favorable balance \\nand adding to the unfavorable balance as per the cash-book. The final balance adjustment depends on whether the result is positive or \\nnegative, affecting the favorable or unfavorable balance accordingly in both the \\ncash-book and pass-book. It is proper to prepare a neat statement showing the reconciliation of the two \\nbalances. Taking the example given in the illustration 1, the statement may be \\nprepared as follows: \\n1. 'Balance' presentation.\"), Document(page_content='2.'), Document(page_content=\"'Plus & Minus' presentation. 7.2 Bank Reconciliation Statement after the Preparation of adjusted \\nCash-Book \\n7.2.1 Meaning of adjusted cash book \\nWhen the balance in the cash book is first adjusted for certain adjustments before \\ntaking it to the bank reconciliation statement, then it is known as adjusted cash \\nbook balance. Adjusting the cash-book before preparing the bank reconciliation \\nstatement is completely optional, if reconciliation is done during different \\nmonths. But if reconciliation is done at the end of the accounting year or financial \\nyear, the cash-book must be adjusted so as to reflect the correct bank balance in \\nthe balance sheet. While adjusting the cash-book the following adjustments are considered:- \\n1. All the errors (like incorrect amount recorded in the cash-book, entry \\nposted twice in the cash-book, over/undercasting of the balance etc.) and \\n2. Omissions (like bank charges recorded in the pass-book only, interest \\ndebited by the bank, direct receipt or payment by the bank, dishonour of \\ncheques/bills etc.) by the cash-book are taken into care \\nOnly above transactions are considered for adjusting cash book. Apart from this, \\nany delay in recording in the pass-book due to difference in timing (like cheque \\nissued but not presented for payment, cheque deposited but not cleared) is taken \\nto bank reconciliation statement. This adjusted cash-book balance is taken to \\nbank reconciliation statement. Errors occurring in the pass-book are not to be adjusted in the cash book. All the \\nadjustments considered in the adjusted cash-book are not carried again to the \\nBank Reconciliation Statement. INVENTORIES \\nTypes of Inventory \\nInventory types vary significantly depending on the business's operational focus.\"), Document(page_content='Inventory in business can be classified as follows: \\nIn the Case of Manufacturing Concerns: \\n1. Raw Materials: These are the basic inputs or components that will be \\ntransformed through the manufacturing process.'), Document(page_content='2. Work-in-Progress (WIP): This includes items that are in the process of \\nbeing manufactured but are not yet complete. 3. Finished Goods: These are the final products that have completed the \\nmanufacturing process and are ready for sale. 4. Stores and Spares: This category consists of the inventory of spare parts \\nand supplies that are kept on hand for maintenance and repairs of \\nmanufacturing equipment. In the Case of Trading Concerns: \\n1.'), Document(page_content='Packing Material: This refers to the material used for packaging the goods \\nfor safe transportation or sale. 2.'), Document(page_content=\"Traded Goods: These are goods purchased by the business with the \\nintention to resell them without further processing. Each type of inventory plays a critical role in the business's supply chain and \\nfinancial reporting. Proper management and valuation of inventory are essential \\nfor accurate financial statements and operational efficiency. This description provides a clear and structured explanation of the different types \\nof inventory relevant to manufacturing and trading businesses, as depicted in the \\nimage. Formulae for Determining Cost of Inventory \\nInventory valuation is a critical aspect of accounting that impacts both the cost of \\ngoods sold (COGS) and inventory balance. The techniques for valuing inventory \\nfall into two broad categories: Historical Cost Methods and Non-Historical Cost \\nMethods. Historical Cost Methods: \\nThis category is based on the actual cost incurred to acquire the inventory and \\nincludes: \\n1. Specific Identification Method: This method tracks the cost of each \\nspecific item of inventory. It is used when the items are not ordinarily \\ninterchangeable, such as unique or custom products.\"), Document(page_content='2. FIFO (First-In, First-Out): FIFO assumes that the oldest inventory items \\nare sold first, hence the cost of the oldest items is used in the COGS \\ncalculation. This is applied to inventory that is ordinarily interchangeable. 3. LIFO (Last-In, First-Out): LIFO assumes that the most recently purchased \\nor produced items are sold first. This method is also used for interchangeable \\ninventory.'), Document(page_content='Non-Historical Cost Methods: \\nThese methods do not solely rely on the historical cost of inventory and include: \\n1. Adjusted Selling Price: This method values inventory based on the selling \\nprice, adjusted for the profit margin. 2. Weighted Average Price: Under this method, the cost of inventory is \\ndetermined by taking a weighted average of all units available for sale during \\nthe period, giving consideration to the cost of each unit. The choice of inventory valuation method can significantly affect financial \\nstatements and tax calculations. Companies choose a method based on several \\nfactors including the nature of the inventory, industry practices, and regulatory \\nrequirements. This description explains the different inventory valuation techniques categorized \\nby their reliance on historical costs or other valuation bases, as depicted in the \\nimage. Basis of Inventory Valuation \\nLower of Cost or Net Realizable Value Rule \\nIn accounting, the valuation of inventory is guided by a conservative principle \\nwhich states that inventory should be recorded at the lower of two figures: \\n1. Cost: This is the price paid to acquire the inventory, including purchase \\nprice, freight, handling, and other costs associated with bringing the \\ninventory to its current condition and location. 2. Net Realizable Value (NRV): This is the estimated selling price in the \\nordinary course of business minus the estimated costs of completion and the \\nestimated costs necessary to make the sale. According to this rule, if the NRV of the inventory is lower than its cost, the \\ninventory is written down to this lower value. This ensures that the inventory is \\nnot overstated on the financial statements and reflects any loss in value due to \\nmarket conditions or obsolescence. The principle is a practical embodiment of \\nthe conservatism constraint in accounting, which seeks to present a cautious and \\nrisk-averse approach to financial reporting. 1. MEANING \\nInventory can be defined as assets held \\n•\\nfor sale in the ordinary course of business, or \\n•\\nin the process of production for such sale, or \\n•\\nfor consumption in the production of goods or services for sale, including \\nmaintenance supplies and consumables other than machinery spares, \\nservicing equipment and standby equipment. There can be different types of inventory based on nature of business of an \\nenterprise. The inventories of a trading concern consist primarily of products \\npurchased for resale in their existing form. It may also have an inventory of \\nsupplies such as wrapping paper, cartons, and stationery. The inventories of \\nmanufacturing concern consist of several types of inventories: raw material \\n(which will become part of the goods to be produced), work-in-process (partially \\ncompleted products in the factory) and finished products. In manufacturing \\nconcerns inventories will also include maintenance supplies, consumables, loose \\ntools and spare parts. However, inventories do not include spare parts, servicing \\nequipment and standby equipment which can be used only in connection with an \\nitem of fixed asset and whose use is expected to be irregular; such machinery \\nspares are generally accounted for as fixed assets. Similarly, in an enterprise \\nengaged in construction business, projects under construction are also \\nconsidered as inventory. At the year-end (or any period for which books are closed) every business entity \\nneeds to ascertain the closing balance of Inventory which comprise of Inventory \\nof raw material, workin-progress, finished goods and other consumable items. Value of closing Inventory is put at the credit side of the Trading Account and \\nasset side of the Balance Sheet. So, before preparation of final accounts, the \\naccountant should know the value of Inventory of the business entity. However, \\nwe shall restrict our discussion on inventory valuation of a manufacturing \\nconcern and goods of a trading concern. 2. INVENTORY VALUATION \\nA primary issue in accounting for inventories is the determination of the value at \\nwhich inventories are carried in the financial statements until the related \\nrevenues are recognized. Inventory is generally the most significant component \\nof the current assets held by a trading or manufacturing enterprise. It is widely \\nrecognized that inventory is one of the major assets that affects efficiency of \\noperations. Both excess of inventory and its shortage affects the production \\nactivity, and the profitability of the enterprise whether it is a manufacturing or a \\ntrading business. Proper valuation of inventory has a very significant bearing on \\nthe authenticity of the financial statements. The significance of inventory \\nvaluation arises due to various reasons as explained in the following points: \\ni. Determination of Income \\nThe valuation of inventory is necessary for determining the true income earned \\nby a business entity during a particular period. To determine gross profit, cost of \\ngoods sold is matched with revenue of the accounting period. Cost of goods sold \\nis calculated as follows: \\nCost of goods sold \\n Opening inventory + Purchases + Direct expenses - Closing \\ninventory. Inventory valuation will have a major impact on the income determination if \\nmerchandise cost is large fraction of sales price. The effect of any over or under \\nstatement of inventory may be explained as: \\nIf closing inventory is overstated, then net income will be overstated. If opening inventory is overstated, then net income will be understated. If closing inventory is understated, then net income will be understated. If opening inventory is understated, then net income will be overstated. =\\nThe effect of misstatement of inventory figure on the net income is always \\nthrough cost of goods sold. Thus, proper calculation of cost of goods sold and for \\nthat matter, proper valuation of inventory is necessary for determination of \\ncorrect income. ii. Ascertainment of Financial Position \\nInventories are classified as current assets. The value of inventory on the date of \\nbalance sheet is required to determine the financial position of the business. In \\ncase the inventory is not properly valued, the balance sheet will not disclose the \\ntruthful financial position of the business. Usually, slow-moving or non-moving inventory is the basic reason for poor \\nfinancial performance as well as financial position of an enterprise. To identify \\nsuch items, the first step is to value the inventory in the appropriate manner. iii.Liquidity Analysis \\nInventory is classified as a current asset, it is one of the components of net \\nworking capital which reveals the liquidity position of the business. Current ratio \\nwhich studies the relationship between current assets and current liabilities is \\nsignificantly affected by the value of inventory. Bankers rely on the current ratio \\nwhich is denoted as current \\nassets divided by current liabilities. If inventory is a major part of the current \\nassets then, naturally, the next set of questions that arise would be: \\na) Whether the inventory is properly valued based on consistently applied \\nprinciples? b) Are there any items of inventory that are either slow-moving or non-\\nmoving? c) How often an external auditor has verified the inventories to make the \\nvaluation reliable? Studies have shown that poor management of inventories, is one of the reasons of \\nlosses of small manufacturing enterprises which eventually leads to shutting \\ndown of such business units. iv.'), Document(page_content='Statutory Compliance \\nSchedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 requires valuation of each class of goods \\ni.e. raw material, work-in-progress and finished goods under broad head to be \\ndisclosed in the financial statements. As per the requirements of the Accounting \\nStandards, the financial statements should disclose: \\na) the accounting policies adopted in measuring inventories, including the \\ncost formula used, and \\nb) the total carrying amount of inventories and its classification appropriate \\nto the enterprise. The common classification of inventories are raw materials; work-in-progress; \\nfinished goods; stores-in-trade (in respect of goods acquired for trading) and \\nspares and loose tools.'), Document(page_content=\"3. BASIS OF INVENTORY VALUATION \\nInventories should be generally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This principle is governed by 'Principle of Conservative Accounting' under which \\nany expenses or losses from transactions entered or event occurred are to be \\nrecognized immediately, however, any gains or profits are not recognized until it \\nbecomes due or are actually realized. Under the principle of 'lower of cost or net \\nrealizable value' any loss due to decrease in sales price of the inventory below its \\ncost is recognized immediately as it is anticipated that the enterprise will make \\nlosses whenever it will sell. Cost: As per Accounting Standards, Cost of inventories should comprise \\n1.\"), Document(page_content=\"all cost of purchase, \\n2. costs of conversion (primarily for finished goods and work - in progress) \\nand \\n3. other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location \\nand condition. Cost of purchase consist of purchase price including duties and taxes (other \\nthan those subsequently recoverable by the enterprise from the taxing \\nauthorities), freight inwards and other expenditure directly attributable to the \\nacquisition. Trade discounts, rebates, duty drawbacks and other similar items are \\ndeducted in determining costs of purchase. In other words, cost includes any \\namount paid to the seller reduced by any discounts/rebates given by the seller. Similarly, any duties paid to the supplier will be part of cost of the inventory \\nunless the enterprises can recover these taxes duties from the authorities. For example- Raw material required for making a product is bought at ₹100 per \\nunit plus GST at \\n units of raw material are bought. 18% . 100\\nSo, the amount that needs to be paid is \\n units \\n GST at \\n However, since the GST on purchase is available as credit, it \\nwon't be counted as the cost of purchase. Hence, the cost of purchase will be ₹ \\n10,000 only and not ₹11,800/- \\nCosts of conversion of inventories include costs directly related to the units of \\nproduction, such as direct labour. They also include a systematic allocation of \\nfixed and variable overheads. Continuing the above example - for the conversion of 100 units of raw material \\ninto finished goods, direct labour cost incurred is \\n. Then, the cost of \\nconversion will be \\n and thus the value of inventory at this stage is ₹ 13,000 \\n(for 100 units) \\nOther Costs may include administrative overheads incurred to bring the \\ninventory into present location and condition or any cost specifically incurred on \\ninventory of a specified customer.

INVENTORY RECORD SYSTEMS \\nThere are two principal systems of determining the physical quantities and \\nmonetary value of inventories sold and in hand. One system is known as 'Periodic \\nInventory System' and the other as the 'Perpetual Inventory System'. The periodic \\nsystem is less expensive to use than the perpetual method. But the useful \\ninformation obtained from perpetual system is more than cost incurred on it. These systems are distinguished on the basis of the actual records kept to \\nascertain the cost of goods sold and the closing inventory valuations. 4.1 PERIODIC INVENTORY SYSTEM \\nPeriodic inventory system is a method of ascertaining inventory by taking an \\nactual physical count (or measure or weight) of all the inventory items on \\nhand at a particular date on which inventory is valued. It is because of actual \\nphysical count that the system is also called physical inventory system. The cost \\nof goods sold is determined as shown below: \\nCalculation of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) \\nThe Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is a key figure on the income statement that \\nrepresents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a \\ncompany. The formula to calculate COGS is as follows: \\nCOGS = Opening Inventory + Purchases - Closing Inventory \\nWhere: \\nOpening Inventory: This is the value of the inventory that a company has at the \\nbeginning of the accounting period. It is the inventory carried over from the end \\nof the previous accounting period.\"), Document(page_content='Purchases: This represents the total cost of inventory bought by the company \\nduring the accounting period. This includes the purchase price, transportation \\ncosts, and any other costs directly related to the acquisition of goods. Closing Inventory: This is the value of the inventory that remains unsold at the \\nend of the accounting period. It is determined by a physical count and is carried \\nforward as the opening inventory for the next accounting period. By subtracting the closing inventory from the sum of opening inventory and \\npurchases, a company can determine the cost of the inventory that was actually \\nsold during the period. Periodic inventory system is simple and less expensive than the perpetual system. In this system, inventory account is adjusted at the end of the accounting period \\nto determine cost of goods sold. This system suffers from various limitations: \\ni. Physical inventory taking is required more than once a year for \\npreparation of quarterly or half yearly financial statements thereby making \\nthis system more expensive. ii. Physical count of goods requires closure of normal operations of business. iii.As cost of goods sold is taken as residual figure, it is not possible to \\nidentify loss of goods due to pilferage, damage or even fraud. iv.'), Document(page_content='Inventory control is not possible under this system. v. Books of accounts does not reflect inventory in hand and its value \\ntherefore, it is difficult to plan operations e.g. how much or when to order/\\nmanufacture.'), Document(page_content='This system is used by small enterprises where it is easy to control physical \\ninventory. This system is not considered suitable for medium or larger \\nenterprises which generally use Perpetual Inventory system. 4.2 PERPETUAL INVENTORY SYSTEM \\nPerpetual inventory system is a system of recording inventory balances after each \\nreceipt and issue. In order to ensure accuracy of perpetual inventory records, \\nphysical inventory should be checked and compared with recorded balances. Under this system, cost of goods issued is directly determined and inventory of \\ngoods is taken as residual figure with the help of inventory ledger in which flow of \\ngoods is recorded on continuous basis. The basic feature of this system is the \\nmaintenance of inventory ledger to have records of goods on continuous basis. Under perpetual inventory system, closing inventory is determined  as follows: \\nDetermination of Closing Stock \\nIn accounting, the closing stock (or closing inventory) is the amount of inventory \\na company has on hand at the end of the accounting period. It can be calculated \\nwhen the opening inventory, purchases during the period, and the cost of goods \\nsold (COGS) are known by using the following equation: \\nClosing Stock = Opening Inventory + Purchases during the period - Cost of Goods \\nSold \\nWhere: \\nOpening Inventory: This is the value of the stock that the business has at the \\nbeginning of the accounting period. It is the unsold inventory carried forward \\nfrom the previous period.'), Document(page_content='Purchases during the period: This includes all the inventory bought during the \\ncurrent accounting period. It is important that purchases are added to the \\nopening inventory to get the total goods available for sale. Cost of Goods Sold: This is the total cost of all inventory that was sold during the \\naccounting period. It includes the cost of the opening inventory plus the cost of \\npurchases, minus the closing stock. By rearranging the formula to solve for the closing stock, the business can infer \\nthe value of unsold inventory at the end of the period. This is crucial for \\npreparing accurate financial statements and for inventory management purposes. This explanation provides an understanding of the method to compute the \\nclosing stock as illustrated in the image, an important concept for financial \\nreporting and inventory management. Perpetual inventory system helps to overcome the limitations of periodic system. As inventory is taken as residual figure, it includes loss of goods. However, the \\nmain limiting factor is the high cost of using this system. 4.3 DISTINCTION BETWEEN PERIODIC INVENTORY SYSTEM AND \\nPERPETUAL INVENTORY SYSTEM \\nBoth the systems - Periodic Inventory System and Perpetual Inventory System \\nare not mutually exclusive and complementary in nature. Distinction between \\nboth the systems can be explained as follows: \\nThe Periodic Inventory System relies on physical counts for inventory \\nassessment, whereas the Perpetual Inventory System is based on continuous \\nbook records. Periodic Inventory provides inventory and cost of goods sold information at \\nspecific times, while Perpetual Inventory offers continuous data on inventory and \\ncost of sales. In the Periodic system, inventory is determined and cost of goods sold is \\ncalculated as the remaining amount, whereas the Perpetual system calculates cost \\nof goods sold directly and inventory as the remaining balance. Cost of goods sold in the Periodic system includes items not present as presumed \\nsold, while in the Perpetual system, the closing inventory considers loss of goods \\nsince all unsold items are assumed to be in inventory. Inventory control is not feasible under the Periodic system, in contrast to the \\nPerpetual system where inventory control is maintained. The Periodic system is noted for its simplicity and cost-effectiveness compared to \\nthe more expensive Perpetual system. The Periodic system necessitates closing the business for inventory counts, \\nwhereas the Perpetual system allows for inventory assessment without disrupting \\nbusiness operations. 5. FORMULAE/METHODS TO DETERMINE COST OF INVENTORY \\n5.1 Historical Cost Methods \\nThere is no unique formula for determination of historical cost of inventories. The different techniques for valuation of inventory have been discussed below: \\ni. Specific Identification Method \\nPricing under this method is based on actual physical flow of goods. It attributes \\nspecific costs to identified goods and requires keeping different lots purchased \\nseparately to identify the lot out of which units in inventories are left. The \\nhistorical costs of such specific purpose inventories may be determined on the \\nbasis of their specific purchase price or production cost. This method is generally used to ascertain the cost of inventories of items that are \\nnot ordinarily interchangeable and their value is high like expensive medical \\nequipment, otherwise it requires the use of FIFO (First in first out) or weighted \\naverage price/average price formula. ii. FIFO (First in first out) Method \\nThis method is based on the assumption that cost should be charged to revenue \\nin the order in which they are incurred, that is, it is assumed that the issue of \\ngoods is usually from the earliest lot on hand. The inventory of goods on hand \\ntherefore, consists of the latest consignments. Thus, the closing inventory is \\nvalued at the price paid for such consignments. The FIFO formula assumes that the items of inventories which were purchased or \\nproduced first are consumed or sold first and consequently items remaining in \\nthe inventory at the end of the period are those most recently purchased or \\nproduced. This assumption is in line with the good business practice to disposing \\ngoods in the order of their acquisition especially in the case of perishable goods \\nand items with frequent technological changes. It must be kept in mind that this \\nassumption of cost flow or goods flow need not be true as a physical fact i.e. not \\nnecessary goods are physically also sold or issued in the chronological order of \\ntheir purchase or production. It relates only to the method of accounting and not \\nto the actual physical movement of goods.'), Document(page_content='Now, let us take an example to understand the application of FIFO method. iii.LIFO (Last in first out) Method \\nAs the name suggests, the LIFO formula assigns to cost of goods sold, the cost of \\ngoods that have been purchased last though the actual issues may be made out of \\nthe earliest lot on hand to prevent unnecessary deterioration in value. The closing \\ninventory then is assumed to consist of earlier consignments and its value is then \\ncalculated according to such consignments. Under this basis, goods issued are \\nvalued at the price paid for the latest lot of goods on hand which means inventory \\nof goods in hand is valued at price paid for the earlier lot of goods. In the absence \\nof details of issue, the price paid for the earliest consignments is used for valuing \\nclosing inventory. LIFO method is based on the principle of matching current \\ncost with current revenue as cost of recently purchased or produced goods are \\ncharged to cost against each sale. The cost of goods sold under this method \\nrepresents the cost of recent purchases resulting that there is better matching of \\ncurrent costs with current sales.'), Document(page_content='iv. Simple Average Price Method \\nSimple Average price for computing value of inventory is a very simple approach. All the different prices are added together and then divided by the number of \\nprices. The closing inventory is then valued according to the price ascertained. This method is generally followed by the entities using periodic inventory method \\nas it does not require efforts of identifying that closing inventory belongs to which \\nconsignments or lots. v. Weighted Average Price Method \\nSimple average price does not consider quantities purchased in various lots. However, it is more logical to compute weighted average price using the \\nquantities purchased in a lot as weights. Under weighted average price method, \\ncost of goods available for sale during the period is aggregated and then divided \\nby number of units available for sale during the period to calculate weighted \\naverage price per unit. Thus \\nW e i g h t e d \\na v e r a g e \\np r i c e \\np e r \\nu n i t \\n Closing inventory \\n No. of units in inventory  Weighted average price per unit \\nCost of goods sold  No. of units sold  Weighted average price per unit. 5.2 Non-Historical Cost Methods \\nNon-historical cost methods do not consider the historical cost incurred to \\nacquire the goods. Non- historical cost methods include Adjusted Selling Price \\nmethod and Standard Cost method. Adjusted Selling Price method can be \\nexplained as follows: \\n(i) Adjusted selling price method \\nThis method is also called retail inventory method. It is used widely in retail \\nbusiness or in business where the inventory comprises of items, the individual \\ncosts of which are not readily ascertainable.'), Document(page_content='The use of this method is appropriate \\nfor measuring inventories of large numbers of rapidly changing items that have \\nsimilar margins and for which it is impracticable to use other costing methods. The cost of the inventory is determined by reducing from the sales value of the \\ninventory an appropriate percentage of gross margin. The percentage used takes \\ninto consideration inventory which has been marked below its original selling \\nprice. An average percentage for each retail department is often used. The \\ncalculation of the estimated gross margin of profit may be made for individual \\nitems or groups of items or by departments, as may be appropriate to the \\ncircumstances.'), Document(page_content='6. INVENTORIES TAKING \\nNormally all operations are suspended for one or two days during the financial \\nyear and physical inventory is taken for everything in the godown or the store \\nperiodically. For the yearend inventory valuation, physical inventory taking is \\n=\\n\\xa0Total\\xa0cost\\xa0of\\xa0goods\\xa0available\\xa0for\\xa0sale\\xa0during\\xa0the\\xa0period\\xa0\\n\\xa0Total\\xa0number\\xa0of\\xa0units\\xa0available\\xa0for\\xa0sale\\xa0during\\xa0the\\xa0period\\xa0\\n=\\n×\\n=\\n×\\ndone during the last week of the financial year or during the first week of next \\nfinancial year. If inventory taking is finished on 26th March, whereas accounting \\nyear ends on 31st March purchases and sales between 26th and 31 st March are \\nthen separately adjusted. Later, a value is put on each item. The principle of cost \\nor Net realizable value, whichever is lower, is applied either for the inventory as a \\nwhole or item by item. Normally, enterprises prefer to perform inventory taking on the closing day, \\nhowever, sometimes inventory taking cannot be carried out on the closing day. It \\nis carried out a few days later or sometimes even a few days earlier. In such a \\ncase, the actual value of the inventory must be so adjusted as to relate it to the \\nend of the year concerned. For doing so, it will be necessary to take into account \\nthe goods that have come in (purchases and sales returns) and those that have \\ngone out (sales and purchase returns) during the interval between the close of the \\nyear and the date of actual inventory taking. Further, the adjustment of all goods must be on the basis of cost or NRV \\nwhichever is lower. Suppose, a firm that closes its books on 31st December, \\ncarried out the inventory taking on the 7th January next year and actual \\ninventory was of the cost of \\n, during the period January 1 to 7 \\npurchases were ₹ 1,53,000 and sales ₹ 2,50,000, the mark up being \\n on cost. The inventory on 31 st December would be \\n \\n₹7,85, 000\\n25%\\n₹8,32, 000\\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION \\n1.INTRODUCTION \\n1.1 Concept of Depreciation \\nTangible Assets are assets that have a physical substance i.e., they can be seen \\nand touched, held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for \\nrental to others, or for administrative purposes. Useful life of tangible asset is \\nbased on expected usage.'), Document(page_content='Property, plant and equipment are tangible items that: \\na. are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental \\nto others, or for administrative purposes; and \\nb. are expected to be used during more than a period of twelve months. These are also called fixed assets in common parlance. When a fixed asset is \\npurchased, it is recorded in books of account at its original or acquisition/\\npurchase cost. However fixed assets are used to earn revenues or save costs for \\nseveral accounting periods in future with the same acquisition cost until the \\nconcerned fixed asset is sold or discarded. For example, acquisition of a \\nmachinery expected to be in use for 10 years in the production of finished goods \\nwill earn revenues over the next 10 years. Similarly, an ATM machine installed by \\na bank will result in cost savings over the expected life of such ATM machines for \\nthe bank in terms of not requiring to employ personnel to dispense cash for \\ncustomers. Since the life of such assets exceeds one year, it is therefore necessary \\nthat a part of the acquisition cost of such fixed \\nassets be treated or allocated as an expense in each of the accounting period in \\nwhich the asset is utilized. The amount or value of fixed assets allocated in such \\nmanner to respective accounting period is called depreciation. Value of such \\nassets decreases with passage of time mainly due to following reasons. 1.'), Document(page_content='Wear and tear due to its use in business \\n2. Efflux of time (even when it is not being used) \\n3. Obsolescence due to technological or other changes \\n4.'), Document(page_content='Decrease in market value \\n5. Depletion mainly in case of mines and other natural reserves \\nIt is important to account for value of portion of property, plant and equipment \\nutilized for generating revenue during an accounting year to ascertain true \\nincome. In other words, against the income/cost savings generated during a \\nperiod, it is essential to book a portion of the cost of the asset utilized in \\ngenerating such income/cost savings. This portion of cost of Property, Plant & \\nEquipment allocated to an accounting year is called depreciation. As per Schedule II under the Companies Act, 2013, Depreciation is the systematic \\nallocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. The \\ndepreciable amount of an asset is the cost of an asset or other amount substituted \\nfor cost (i.e., in case of revaluation of assets, such revalued amount), less its \\nresidual value. The useful life of an asset is the period over which an asset is \\nexpected to be available for use by an entity, or the number of production or \\nsimilar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the entity. Thus, there are 3 important factors for computing depreciation: \\n•\\n Estimated useful life of the asset \\n•\\nCost of the asset \\n•\\n Residual value of the asset at the end of the of its estimated useful life \\nDepreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e., when it is in the \\nlocation and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner \\nintended by management. Thus it is not necessary that an asset must be used to \\nbe depreciated. There is decrease in value of assets due to normal wear and tear \\nor obsolescence even when these are not physically used. Accordingly, value of \\nsuch wear and tear should be estimated and accounted for. Depreciation is allocated so as to charge a fair proportion of the depreciable \\namount in each accounting period during the expected useful life of the asset. Depreciation for a period helps to charge that portion of the cost of the asset \\nagainst the revenues earned, which is expired for that period and hence follows \\nmatching principle. In other words the total cost of the asset is reflected in form \\nof a) Expired cost (depreciation) and b) Unexpired Cost which shall be the \\nwritten down value of the asset being reflected in balance sheet. Also, charging \\ndepreciation every year reduces the distributable profits thereby ensuring the \\navailability of funds whenever the replacement is required. The depreciation is a type of loss in the value of assets employed for carrying on a \\nbusiness. Being an essential element of business expenditure, it is necessary to \\ncalculate the amount of such loss and to make a provision, and therefore, arrive \\nat the amount of profit or loss made by the business. Basically, the cost of an asset used for purpose of business has to be written off \\nover its economic (not physical) life which must be estimated. A point to \\nremember is that usually, at the end of the economic life, an asset has some value \\nas scrap or otherwise. The amount to be written off in each year should be as such \\nwhich will reduce the book value of the asset, at the end of its economic life, to its \\nestimated scrap value. 1.2 Depreciation on components of an assets \\nIt may be noted that Accounting Standards as well as the Companies Act, 2013 \\nrequires depreciation to be charged on a component basis. Each part of an item of \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the \\ntotal cost of the item should be depreciated separately. An enterprise should \\nallocate the amount initially recognised in respect of an item of property, plant \\nand equipment to its significant parts/components and should depreciate each \\nsuch part separately based on the useful life and residual value of each particular \\ncomponent. For Example- Aircraft is a classic example of such an asset.'), Document(page_content='The \\nairframe (i.e.'), Document(page_content='the body of the aircraft), the engines and the interiors have different \\nindividual useful lives. If the life of the airframe (being the longest of the \\nindividual lives of the three major types of components) is taken as the life of the \\naircraft, it is important that other two major components i.e. engine and interiors \\nare depreciated over their respective useful life and not over the life of airframe. Other components (usually small and low value) which will require replacement \\nvery frequently may be depreciated over the useful life of airframe and their \\nfrequent replacement cost may be charged to expense as and when it is incurred. Here it is important to note that a part of Property, Plant & Equipment to be \\nidentified as a separate component should have both \\na) significant cost when compared to overall cost of item of property, plant \\nand equipment and \\nb) an estimated useful life or depreciation method different from rest of the \\nparts of the property plant and equipment. A significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment may have a useful \\nlife and a depreciation method that are the same as the useful life and the \\ndepreciation method of \\nanother significant part of that same item. Such parts may be grouped in \\ndetermining the depreciation charge. 1.3 Objectives for Providing Depreciation \\nPrime objectives for providing depreciation are: \\n1. Correct income measurement: Depreciation should be charged for proper \\nestimation of periodic profit or loss. In case an enterprise does not account \\nfor depreciation on Property, Plant & Equipment, it will not be considering \\nloss in value of property, plant  equipment due to their use in production or \\noperations of the enterprise and will not result in true profit or loss for the \\nperiod. 2. True position statement: Value of the Property, Plant & Equipment should \\nbe adjusted for depreciation charged in order to depict the actual financial \\nposition. In case depreciation is not accounted for appropriately, the \\nproperty, plant and equipment would be disclosed in financial statements at \\na value higher than their true value. We should always present the same at its \\nunexpired cost which is after charging the expired cost as depreciation.'), Document(page_content='3. Funds for replacement: Generation of adequate funds in the hands of the \\nbusiness for replacement of the asset at the end of its useful life. Depreciation \\nis a good indication of the amount an enterprise should set aside to replace a \\nfixed asset after its economic useful life is over. However, the replacement \\ncost of a fixed asset may additionally be impacted by inflation or other \\ntechnological changes. 4. Ascertainment of true cost of production: For ascertaining the cost of the \\nproduction, it is necessary to charge depreciation as an item of cost of \\nproduction. Further depreciation is a non-cash expense and unlike other normal expenditure \\n(e.g.'), Document(page_content='wages, rent, etc.) does not result in any cash outflow. Further depreciation \\nby itself does not create funds it merely draws attention to the fact that out of \\ngross revenue receipts, a certain amount should be retained for replacement of \\nassets used for carrying on operation which is achieved by charging depreciation \\nthat reduces the distributable profits. 2.FACTORS IN THE MEASUREMENT OF DEPRECIATION \\nEstimation of exact amount of depreciation is not easy as it involves lot of \\nestimation.

Useful Life of the Asset: The 'Useful Life' of an asset can be defined in two \\nways: (i) the period over which the asset is expected to be used by the \\nenterprise, or (ii) the number of production or similar units expected to be \\nobtained from the asset's use. The determination of useful life involves \\nvarious factors including experience with similar assets, estimated working \\nhours, production capacity, repairs, and renewals. 3. Scrap (Residual Value): Estimating the residual or scrap value of an asset \\nat the end of its useful life is a challenging task. This value may be considered \\ninsignificant, and thus, regarded as nil, or it may be substantial, estimated at \\nthe time of asset acquisition or during a revaluation.\"), Document(page_content=\"4. Depreciable Amount: This is the historical cost of the asset or its revalued \\namount, less any estimated residual value. For instance, if a machine with a \\nhistorical cost of ₹1,10,000 is estimated to have a residual value of ₹10,000 \\nand a useful life of 5 years, the depreciable amount would be ₹1,00,000. The \\nannual depreciation in this case would be calculated as ₹1,00,000 divided by \\nthe useful life of 5 years. The depreciable amount is allocated on a systematic basis over the asset's useful \\nlife, reflecting the pattern in which the asset's economic benefits are consumed by \\nthe enterprise. This explanation captures the key elements and calculations involved in the \\ndepreciation of assets as indicated in the image. Cost of Property, Plant and Equipment comprises: \\na) its purchase price, including non-refundable import duties and purchase \\ntaxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates. b) any cost directly attributable to bring the asset to the location and \\ncondition necessary for it to be capable of operating in a manner intended by \\nthe enterprise.\"), Document(page_content='Depreciation\\xa0=\\n\\xa0Depreciable\\xa0amount\\xa0\\n\\xa0Estimated\\xa0useful\\xa0life\\xa0\\n\\xa0i.e. ₹1,00,000/5=₹20,000\\xa0per\\xa0year\\xa0\\nc) the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling, removing, the item and \\nrestoring the site on which an asset is located. Examples of directly attributable costs are: \\na.'), Document(page_content='cost of employee benefits arising directly from acquisition or construction \\nof an item of property, plant and equipment.'), Document(page_content='b.'), Document(page_content='cost of site preparation \\nc. initial delivery and handling costs \\nd.'), Document(page_content=\"installation and assembly costs \\ne. cost of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, after deducting \\nthe net proceeds from selling the items produced while testing (such as \\nsamples produced while testing) \\nf. professional fees e.g. engineers hired for helping in installation of a \\nmachine \\nThus, all the expenses which are necessary for the asset to bring it in condition \\nand location of desired use will become part of cost of the asset. However, \\nfollowing expenses should not become part of cost of asset: \\na) costs of opening new facility or business, such as inauguration costs; \\nb) cost of introducing new product or service (for example cost of \\nadvertisement or promotional activities). c) cost of conducting business in a new location or with a new class of \\ncustomer (including cost of staff training); and \\nd) administration and other general overhead costs. Once an asset has been brought to its intended condition and location of use, no \\ncost should be recognized as part of cost of the asset unless there is major repair \\nor addition which increases the useful life of the asset or improves the production \\ncapacity of the asset. Accordingly, cost incurred while an item is capable of \\noperating in intended manner but it is not yet put to use or is used at less than \\nfull capacity should not be capitalized as part of cost of the asset. Similarly, cost \\nof relocation of an asset should not be capitalized. Any additions made to a particular item of property, plant and equipment after it \\nis initially put to use are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. Any addition or extension which has a separate identity and is capable of being \\nused after the existing asset is disposed of, is accounted for separately. Therefore, \\nit is important to maintain an asset register capturing asset wise details of cost, \\nrate of depreciation, date of capitalization etc. All these details need to be \\ncaptured for any additions to existing assets as well. In the absence of the \\nadequate information, it will be very difficult to compute depreciation expense \\nyear on year. Also, at the time of disposal or discard of a particular asset, it will \\nnot be possible to compute gain or loss on such disposal/discard. 3.METHODS FOR PROVIDING DEPRECIATION \\nGenerally, methods for providing depreciation are based on formula, developed \\non a study of the behavior of the assets over a period of years for readily \\ncomputing the amount of depreciation suffered by different forms of assets. Each \\nof the methods, however, should be applied only after carefully considering \\nnature of the asset and the conditions under which it is being used. Commonly Used Methods of Depreciation \\nDepreciation methods are systematic approaches to allocate the cost of a tangible \\nasset over its useful life. Two prevalent methods are: \\n1. Straight-Line Method: This method results in a constant depreciation \\ncharge over the useful life of the asset, assuming that the asset's residual \\nvalue does not change. The straight-line method is simple and is calculated \\nby dividing the depreciable amount of the asset by the number of years of its \\nuseful life. 2. Diminishing Balance Method: Also known as the reducing balance \\nmethod, this results in a decreasing charge over the useful life of the asset. The depreciation expense is higher in the earlier years of an asset's life and \\ndecreases over time. This method is based on the premise that an asset is \\nmore productive in its early years than in its later years.\"), Document(page_content='The choice between these methods depends on the nature of the asset, the \\npattern of its economic benefits, and company policy. The Income Tax Rules, however, prescribe the Diminishing Balance Method \\nexcept in the case of assets of an undertaking engaged in generation and \\ndistribution of power. 3.1 Straight Line Method \\nAccording to this method, an equal amount is written off every year during the \\nworking life of an asset so as to reduce the cost of the asset to nil or its residual \\nvalue at the end of its useful life. The advantage of this method is that it is simple \\nto apply and gives accurate results especially in case of leases, and also in case of \\nplant and machinery. This method is also known as Fixed Instalment Method. Straight Line Depreciation \\n \\n=\\n\\xa0Cost\\xa0of\\xa0Asset\\xa0−\\xa0Scrap\\xa0Value\\xa0\\n\\xa0Usefullife\\xa0\\nStraight Line Depreciation Rate \\n \\nThe underlying assumption of this method is that the particular tangible asset \\ngenerates equal utility during its lifetime. But this cannot be true under all \\ncircumstances.'), Document(page_content='The expenditure incurred on repairs and maintenance will be low \\nin earlier years, whereas the same will be high as the asset becomes old. Apart \\nfrom this the asset may also have varying capacities over the years, indicating \\nlogic for unequal depreciation provision. However, many assets have insignificant \\nrepairs and maintenance expenditures for which straight line method can be \\napplied. While using this method the period of use of an asset in a particular year should \\nalso be considered. In the year of purchase of an asset it may have been available \\nfor use for part of the year only, accordingly depreciation should be proportioned \\nto reflect the period for which it was available for use. For example, if an asset \\nwas purchased on March 1, 2022 and the enterprise prepares financial \\nstatements for the year ending on March 31, 2022 depreciation will be provided \\nfor a period of 1 month only. Similar situation will arise in the year in which an \\nasset is retired from its intended used or is sold. 3.2 Reducing or Diminishing Balance Method or Written Down Value \\n(WDV) Method \\nUnder this system, a fixed percentage of the diminishing value of the asset is \\nwritten off each year so as to reduce the asset to its residual value at the end of its \\nlife. Repairs and small renewals are charged to revenue.'), Document(page_content='This method is \\ncommonly used for plant, fixtures, etc. Under this method, the annual charge for \\ndepreciation decreases from year to year, so that the earlier years suffer to the \\nbenefit of the later years. Also, under this method, the value of asset can never be \\ncompletely extinguished, which happens in the earlier explained Straight Line \\nMethod. This method is based on the assumption that cost of repairs will increase \\nas the asset gets old, therefore, depreciation in earlier years should be high when \\nthe repair cost is expected to be low and depreciation in later years should be low \\nwhen the repair cost is expected to be high. Therefore, this method will result in \\nalmost equal burden in all the years of use of the asset as depreciation will reduce \\nwith increase in repair costs will increase with every passing year. On the other \\nhand, under the Straight Line Method, the charge for depreciation is constant, \\nwhile repairs tend to increase with the life of the asset. Among the disadvantages \\nof this method is the danger that too low a percentage may be adopted as \\ndepreciation with the result that over the life of the asset full depreciation may \\nnot be provided; also if assets are grouped in such a way that individual assets are \\ndifficult to identify, \\nthe residue of an asset may lie in the asset account even after the asset has been \\nscrapped. The last mentioned difficulty could be, however, over come if a Plant \\nregister is maintained. =\\n\\xa0Straight\\xa0Line\\xa0Depreciation\\xa0\\n\\xa0Cost\\xa0of\\xa0Asset\\xa0\\n× 100\\nThe rate of depreciation under this method may be determined by the following \\nformula: \\n \\nwhere, \\n useful life \\nSimilar to straight line method, in this method also period of use in a particular \\nyear e.g. year of purchase or sale an item of property plant and equipment needs \\nto be considered while computing the depreciation amount. Accounting Entries under Straight Line and Reducing Balance \\nMethods: \\nThere are two alternative approaches for recording accounting entries for \\ndepreciation. First Alternative \\nA provision for depreciation or Accumulated Depreciation account is opened to \\naccumulate the balance of depreciation and the assets are carried at historical \\ncost. This method is preferred by most of the organizations as it presents both the \\ngross investment and the current value of the assets. Accounting entry \\nDepreciation Account \\nDr. To Provision for Depreciation Account  \\nor Accumulated Depreciation \\nProfit and Loss Account                  Dr. To Depreciation Account \\nSecond Alternative \\nAmount of Depreciation is credited to the Asset Account every year and the Asset \\nAccount is carried at historical cost less depreciation. Accounting entries: \\n1 −\\nn \\xa0Residual\\xa0Value\\xa0\\n\\xa0Cost\\xa0of\\xa0Assets\\xa0 × 100\\nn =\\nDepreciation Account        Dr. To Asset Account \\nProfit and Loss Account    Dr. To Depreciation Account \\n3.3 Sum of Years of Digits Method \\nIt is a variation of the \"Reducing Balance Method\". In this case, the annual \\ndepreciation is calculated by multiplying the original cost of the asset less its \\nestimated scrap value by the fraction represented by: \\nThe number of years (including the present year) of remaining life of the asset \\nTotal of all digits of the life of the asset (in years) \\nSuppose the estimated life of an asset is 10 years; the total of all the digits from 1 \\nto 10 is 55 i.e., \\n, or by the formula: \\n \\n \\nThe depreciation to be written off in the first year will be 10/55 of the cost of the \\nasset less estimated scrap value; and the depreciation for the second year will be \\n of the cost of asset less estimated scrap value and so on. The method is not yet in vogue; and its advantages are the same as those of the \\nReducing Balance Method. 3.4 Machine Hour Method \\nWhere it is practicable to keep a record of the actual running hours of each \\nmachine, depreciation may be calculated on the basis of hours that the concerned \\nmachine worked. The machine hour rate of the depreciation, is calculated after \\nestimating the total number of hours that machine would work during its whole \\nlife; however, it may have to be varied from time to time, on a consideration of \\nthe changes in the economic and technological conditions which might take \\nplace, to ensure that the amount provided for depreciation corresponds to that \\nconsidered appropriate in the changed circumstances. It would be observed that \\nthe method is a variation of the Straight Line Method under which depreciation is \\ncalculated per year. Under this method it is calculated for each hour the machine \\nworks. 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1\\nn(n + 1) = 10 × 11 = 55\\n22\\n9/55\\nSchedule II to the Companies Act 2013 which prescribes estimated useful life of \\ndifferent assets for companies also recognizes this method to some extent. It \\nprescribes that depreciation should be charged using estimated useful life \\nsuggested in it; however, in certain category of plant and machinery it prescribes \\ncharging higher amount of depreciation if these assets are used for 2 shifts or 3 \\nshifts. In a way, schedule II combines straight line method and machine hour \\nmethod. 3.5 Production Units Method \\nUnder this method depreciation of the asset is determined by comparing the \\nannual production with the estimated total production. The amount of \\ndepreciation is computed by the use of following method: \\n \\nThe method is applicable to machines producing product of uniform \\nspecifications. 3.6 Depletion Method \\nDepletion is the allocation of the cost of wasting natural resources such as oil, \\ngas, timber, and minerals to the production process. This method is used in case \\nof mines, quarries etc.'), Document(page_content=\"containing only a certain quantity of product. The \\ndepreciation rate is calculated by dividing the cost of the asset by the estimated \\nquantity of product likely to be available to be extracted. Annual depreciation will \\nbe the quantity extracted multiplied by the rate per unit. 4.PROFIT OR LOSS ON THE SALE/DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, \\nPLANT AND EQUIPMENT \\nWhenever any depreciable asset is sold during the year, depreciation is charged \\non it for the period it has been used in the sale year. The written down value after \\ncharging such depreciation is used for calculating the profit or loss on the sale of \\nthat asset. The resulting profit or loss on sale of the asset is ultimately transferred \\nto profit and loss account. Thus, all entries related to sale and profit or loss on \\nsale of asset are posted in the respective asset account. Alternatively, a new \\naccount titled Asset disposal Account may also be opened in the ledger for the \\npurpose of calculating profit or loss on sale of asset. In that case the book value of \\nthe asset will be transferred from the asset account to the asset disposal account \\nand all entries related to sale like sale proceeds and calculation of profit or loss on \\nsale will be posted in the Asset disposal account. 5.CHANGE IN THE METHOD OF DEPRECIATION \\n\\xa0Depreciable\\xa0Amount\\xa0×\\n\\xa0Production\\xa0during\\xa0the\\xa0period\\xa0\\n\\xa0Estimated\\xa0total\\xa0production\\xa0\\nThe depreciation method applied to an asset should be reviewed at least at each \\nfinancial year-end and, if there has been a significant change in the expected \\npattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset, \\nthe method should be changed to reflect the changed pattern. Whenever any \\nchange in depreciation method is made, such change in method is treated as \\nchange in accounting estimate as per Accounting Standards. Its effect needs to be \\nquantified and disclosed separately. A change in an accounting estimate may \\naffect the current period only or both the current period and future periods. 6.REVISION OF THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY, \\nPLANT AND EQUIPMENT \\nThe residual value and the useful life of an asset should be reviewed at least at \\neach financial year-end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the \\nchange(s) should be accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in \\naccordance with Accounting Standards. Whenever there is a revision in the estimated useful life of the asset, the written \\ndown value or the balance depreciable amount should be charged over the \\nrevised remaining estimated useful life of the asset. 7.REVALUATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT \\nAfter recognizing an asset initially, the asset whose fair value could be reliably \\nmeasured could be carried at the revalued amount, being the fair value at \\nrevaluation date and reduced by successively accumulated depreciation and \\nsuccessive accumulated impairment losses (permanent decline in value) (if any). If an entity opts for revaluation: \\na) Revaluations must be made at adequate intervals (say yearly) for ensuring \\nthat carrying amount doesn't differ substantially from that which would be \\ndetermined if fair value at end of the reporting period is used \\nb) In case an item of PPE is revalued, whole class of such PPE to which such \\nasset belongs should be revalued \\nc) In case the carrying amount of an asset increases due to revaluation, such \\nincrease should be credited to revaluation surplus and should be \\naccumulated in equity. However, such increase should be recognized in Profit \\nand Loss statement to the extent of reversal of a previous decrease of that \\nasset that was recognized in the Profit and Loss statement. d) In case the carrying amount of an asset is decreased due to revaluation, \\nsuch decrease should be recognized in the Profit and Loss account. However, \\nsuch decrease should be debited to the revaluation surplus to the extent of \\nreversal of a previous increase that was recognized in revaluation surplus for \\nthat asset. e) The Revaluation Surplus may be transferred directly to retained earnings \\nwhen the asset is derecognized. This may involve transferring the whole of \\nthe surplus when the asset is retired or disposed of. Such transfer from \\nRevaluation Surplus to Retained Earnings cannot be made through the Profit \\nor Loss. Alternatively, where there is an upward revaluation, the excess depreciation on \\naccount of such upward revaluation may be transferred from Revaluation Surplus \\nto Retained Earnings. Such transfer from Revaluation Surplus to Retained \\nEarnings cannot be made through the Profit or Loss. It may be pertinent to note that revaluation of Property, Plant and Equipment is \\nan accounting policy choice, and not mandatory under the accounting standards \\nor the Companies Act, 2013. Accounting for Revaluation of Assets \\nRevaluation of assets is an adjustment of the carrying value of a fixed asset to its \\ncurrent market value. The accounting entries for revaluation can result in either \\nan increase or a decrease in the asset's book value, and the treatment of these \\nchanges is as follows: \\nFor an Increase in Asset Value: \\nThe increase is credited directly to the owners' equity under the heading of \\nrevaluation surplus, reflecting the appreciation in the asset's value. Exception: If the increase is a subsequent increase following an initial decrease, \\nthe increase should be recognized in the profit and loss statement to the extent \\nthat it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in \\nthe profit and loss. For a Decrease in Asset Value: \\nThe decrease is charged directly to the profit and loss statement, reflecting a loss \\nin the asset's value. Exception: If the decrease occurs after an initial increase in value, the decrease \\nshould be debited directly to owners' equity under the heading of revaluation \\nsurplus to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in \\nrespect of that asset.\"), Document(page_content='These accounting treatments ensure that the financial statements reflect the true \\nvalue of the assets and the financial position of the business accurately. 8.INTANGIBLE ASSETS \\nAn intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset, without physical \\nsubstance, held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental \\nto others, or for administrative purposes. Examples of intangible assets include: \\na. Streaming rights of movies / TV shows / web series on platforms like \\nNetflix, Disney Hot Star, Amazon Prime / Sony LIV etc.'), Document(page_content='b. Broadcasting rights of events such as the Cricket World Cup, the Indian \\nPremier League, the Pro Kabaddi League etc. c.'), Document(page_content='Landing rights / time slots at airports which permit aircrafts to land or \\ntake-off during a particular time frame \\nd. Patents \\ne.'), Document(page_content='Trademarks \\nf. Copyrights \\ng. Distribution rights for motion pictures in theatres \\nh. Long-term customer contracts \\ni. Customer data collected by the entities such as customer contact \\nnumbers / email IDs and spending data at stores like Pantaloons, Westside \\netc. could be a major intangible asset for these entities.'), Document(page_content='j. Goodwill (purchased) \\nk. Computer Software \\nIntangible assets comprise a major portion of the balance sheet. It may be noted \\nthat it can also be the case that intangible assets could make the entities far more \\nvaluable than the tangible assets. For instance, a multi-year customer contract \\nguaranteeing more than \\n of the revenue for the company is a major asset, \\nwhich on occasions could be more valuable than the tangible assets themselves. Similarly, when Air India was up for acquisition, the tangible assets comprised of \\nseveral old planes which needed overhauling and maintenance. However, one of \\nthe major reasons that made Air India a desirable target was the prime landing \\nslots (intangible asset) that it had at airports across the world \\nIntangible assets can be recognized in the financial statements provided they \\nmeet the following conditions: \\ni. The intangible asset is identifiable.'), Document(page_content='Being identifiable means the entity \\ncould rent, sell, exchange or distribute the specific future economic benefits \\nattributable to the asset \\n75%\\nwithout disposing of future economic benefits that flow from other assets \\nused in the same revenue earning activity. ii.'), Document(page_content='The enterprise can exercise control over such intangible asset. Control \\nmeans the power available with the enterprise to obtain economic benefits \\nfrom the asset and at the same time, can restrict access of others to those \\nbenefits. iii.It is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the asset \\nwill flow to the enterprise; and \\niv.'), Document(page_content=\"The cost of the intangible asset can be measured reliably. An intangible asset acquired separately usually measured at cost, as cost can be \\nmeasured reliably in such cases. The cost of the intangible asset would comprise \\nof: \\n•\\nPurchase price \\n•\\nAny import duties and taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by \\nthe enterprise from the tax authorities) \\n•\\nAny directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its \\nintended use e.g., professional fees towards legal services. Any trade \\ndiscounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the cost. As can be seen above, the cost of an intangible asset is similar to the manner in \\nwhich the cost of a tangible asset is determined. Intangible assets acquired as part of acquisition, government grants, internally \\ngenerated goodwill / intangible assets, or on exchange of assets are dealt \\nseparately at the intermediate level. An intangible asset should be derecognised (eliminated from the balance sheet) \\non disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use and \\nsubsequent disposal. Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of an intangible asset \\nshould be determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the \\ncarrying amount of the asset and should be recognised as income or expense in \\nthe statement of profit and loss. Difference between Tangible and Intangible Assets \\nTangible Assets: \\nThese are assets that have a physical substance, i.e., they can be seen and \\ntouched, held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental \\nto others, or for administrative purposes. Tangible Assets have a finite life based \\non expected usage. Useful life is based on expected usage, with no presumption \\nlaid down for the same. Tangible Assets are depreciated over the useful life. In \\nother words, writing off the value of tangible assets on an annual basis is known \\nas depreciation. Examples include Property, Machinery, Vehicles etc. Intangible Assets: \\nThese are identifiable assets that do NOT have a physical substance, held for use \\nin the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for \\nadministrative purposes. Intangible Assets have a finite life based on contractual \\nterms. In some cases, intangible assets could also have an indefinite life e.g., \\npurchased goodwill. Useful life of Intangible Assets is presumed not to exceed 10 \\nyears unless evidence exists to the contrary. Intangible Assets are amortised over \\nthe useful life. In other words, writing off the value of intangible assets on an \\nannual basis is known as amortisation. Examples include software, streaming \\nrights, landing rights, trademarks, patents etc. 9.AMORTISATION \\nThe concept of amortisation in case of intangible assets is similar to the concept \\nof depreciation in case of tangible assets. In other words, 'depreciation of an \\nintangible asset' is called AMORTISATION. Amortisation can be defined as 'the systematic allocation of the depreciable \\namount of an intangible asset over its useful life'. Depreciable amount is the cost \\nof an asset less its residual value. Useful life is either: \\na) the period of time over which an asset is expected to be used by the \\nenterprise; or \\nb) the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from \\nthe asset by the enterprise. Residual value is the amount which an enterprise expects to obtain for an asset at \\nthe end of its useful life after deducting the expected costs of disposal. The depreciable amount of an intangible asset should be allocated on a \\nsystematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life. Amortisation should \\ncommence when the asset is available for use. It is presumed that the useful life \\nof an intangible asset will not exceed ten years from the date when the asset is \\navailable for use unless evidence exists to the contrary. For instance, given the \\nrapid changes in technology, computer software and many other intangible assets \\nare susceptible to technological obsolescence. Therefore, it is likely that their \\nuseful life will be short. Similarly, intangible assets with contractual rights for a \\nperiod exceeding ten years, will be amortised over such extended period rather \\nthan the presumed period of ten years. Similar to depreciation, the amortisation method used should reflect the pattern \\nin which the asset's economic benefits are consumed by the enterprise. If that \\npattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method should be used. The amortisation charge for each period should be recognised as an expense \\nunless permitted or required to be included in the carrying amount of another \\nasset. Given the nature of intangible assets, the residual value of an intangible asset \\nshould be assumed to be zero unless: \\na.\"), Document(page_content=\"there is a commitment by a third party to purchase the asset at the end of \\nits useful life; or \\nb. there is an active market for the asset and: \\ni. residual value can be determined by reference to that market; and \\nii. it is probable that such a market will exist at the end of the asset's \\nuseful life. The amortisation period and the amortisation method should be reviewed at least \\nat each financial year end. If the expected useful life of the asset is significantly \\ndifferent from previous estimates, the amortisation period should be changed \\naccordingly.\"), Document(page_content='If there has been a significant change in the expected pattern of \\neconomic benefits from the asset, the amortisation method should be changed to \\nreflect the changed pattern. BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND PROMISSORY NOTES \\nBills of Exchange \\nA Bill of Exchange is a written, unconditional order by one party (the drawer) to \\nanother (the drawee) to pay a certain sum, either immediately (a sight bill) or on \\na fixed date (a term bill), to the drawer or to a third party specified by the drawer.

Promissory Note \\nA Promissory Note is a financial instrument that contains a written promise by \\none party to pay another party a definite sum of money either on demand or at a \\nspecified future date. It is a simpler instrument than a bill of exchange and is not \\nas commonly used in international trade.'), Document(page_content='1. BILLS OF EXCHANGE \\nIt is general practice that when goods are sold or services are provided, the seller \\nextends a credit period to buyer. Sometimes, the seller may not be in a position to \\noffer credit period and the purchase is not in a position to pay immediately. In \\nsuch circumstances the seller would like that the purchaser should give a definite \\npromise in writing to pay the amount of the goods on a certain date which he can \\nuse to generate immediate funds. Commercial practice has developed to treat \\nthese written promises into valuable instruments of credit that when a written \\npromise is made in proper form and is properly stamped, it is expected that the \\nbuyer discharges his debt and the seller receives payment. This is because written \\npromises are often accepted by banks and money is advanced against them. Also, \\nthey can be endorsed, i.e., passed on from person to person. The written promise \\nis either in the form of a Bill of Exchange or in the form of a promissory note. A Bill of Exchange has been defined as an \"instrument in writing containing an \\nunconditional \\norder signed by the maker directing certain person to pay a certain sum of money \\nonly to or to the order of a certain person or to the bearer of the instrument\". When such an order is accepted in writing on the face of the order itself, it \\nbecomes a valid bill of exchange. Suppose A orders B to pay ₹50,000 for three \\nmonths after date and B accepts this order by signing his name, then it will be a \\nbill of exchange. A Bill of Exchange has the following characteristics: \\n1. It must be in writing.'), Document(page_content='2. It must be dated. 3. It must contain an order to pay a certain sum of money. 4.

The party which \\naccepts the order is known as the acceptor and the party to whom the amount has \\nto be paid is known as the payee. The drawer and the payee can be the same. A Bill of Exchange can be passed on to another person by endorsement. Endorsement on a bill of exchange is made exactly as it is done in the case of a \\ncheque.

DIFFERENCES – BILL OF EXCHANGE AND PROMISSORY \\nNOTE \\nBill of Exchange: \\nA Bill of Exchange contains an order to pay a specific amount.

It is usually drawn by the creditor. The drawer and payee can be the same person in a Bill of Exchange. The liability of the drawer is secondary and conditional. If the acceptor fails to \\npay, the drawer can be held liable. Promissory Note: \\nA Promissory Note contains a promise to pay a certain sum of money. Involves two parties: the Maker (the one who promises to pay) and the Payee (the \\none to whom the payment is to be made). The note is paid by the maker. It is created by the debtor. The maker and payee cannot be the same person in a Promissory Note. The liability of the maker of a Promissory Note is primary and absolute. A Promissory Note cannot be made conditionally. A notice of dishonor is not required in the case of promissory note dishonour. Note: In both instruments, dishonour leads to certain legal implications for the \\nparties involved. In the case of a Bill of Exchange, a notice of dishonour may be \\nnecessary, whereas for a Promissory Note, such notice is typically not required. 4. RECORD OF BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND PROMISSORY NOTES \\nA party which receives a Promissory Note or receives an accepted Bill of \\nExchange will treat it as a new asset under the name of Bills receivable. A party \\nwhich issues a Promissory Note or accepts a Bill of Exchange will treat it as new \\nliability under the heading of Bills Payable. We shall first deal with the entries in \\nthe books of the party which receives promissory notes or bills. (When we talk of \\nbills, we include promissory notes also). On receipt of Bill, the payee makes the following entry in his books of accounts: \\nBills Receivable Account                                                 Dr. To Drawee/Maker of the note \\n(1) A accepts a Bill of exchange drawn on him by B. In the books of B the entry \\nwill be : \\nBills Receivable Account                                                Dr. To A \\n(2) A sends to B the acceptance of D. In this case also, the entry in the books of B \\nwill be: \\nBills Receivable Account                                                 Dr. To A \\nThe person who receives the bill has three options.'), Document(page_content='These are: \\ni. He can hold the bill till maturity. (Naturally in this case no further entry is \\npassed until the date of maturity arrives). ii. The bill can be endorsed in favour of another party say Z. In this case, the \\nentry will be to debit the party which now receives the bill and to credit the \\nBills Receivable Account. Z \\nDr. To Bills Receivable Account \\niii.The Bill of Exchange can be discounted with bank. The bank will deduct a \\nsmall sum of money as discount and pay rest of the money.'), Document(page_content='Bank Account Dr.'), Document(page_content=\"(with the amount actually received) \\nDiscount Account Dr. (with the amount of loss or discount) \\nTo Bills Receivable Account \\nOn the date of maturity there will be two possibilities: \\na) The first is that the bill will be paid, that is to say, met or honoured. The \\nentries for this will depend upon what was done to the bill during the period \\nof maturity. If the bill was kept, the cash will be received by the party which \\noriginally received the bill. In his books, therefore, the entry will be : \\nBank Account                                  Dr. To Bills Receivable Account \\nBut if he has already endorsed the bill in favour of his creditor or if the bill has \\nbeen discounted with the bank he will not get the amount; it will be the creditor \\nor the bank which will receive the money. Therefore, in these two cases, no entry \\nwill be made in the books of the party which originally received the bill. b) The second possibility is that the bill will be dishonoured, that is to say, \\nthe bill will not be paid. If the bill is dishonoured, the bill becomes useless \\nand the party from whom the bill was received will be liable to pay the \\namount (and also the expenses incurred by the party). Therefore, the following entries will be made : \\n1. If the bill was kept till maturity then : \\nDrawee / Maker Account \\nDr. To Bills Receivable Account \\n2. If the bill was endorsed in favour of a creditor, the entry is : \\nDrawee / Maker Account Dr. To Creditor Account \\n3. If the bill was discounted with the bank : \\nDrawee / Maker Account Dr. To Bank Account \\nThus, it will be seen that in case of dishonour, the party which gave the bill has to \\nbe debited (because he has become liable to pay the amount). The credit entry is \\nin Bills Receivable Account (if it was retained) or the Creditor or the bank (if it \\nwas endorsed/discounted in their favour). 5. TERM OF A BILL \\nThe term of bill of exchange may be of any duration. Usually the term does not \\nexceed 90 days from the date of the bill. When a bill is drawn after sight, the term of the bill begins to run from the date \\nof 'sighting', i.e., when the bill is accepted. When a bill is drawn after date, the term of the bill begins to run from the date \\nof drawing the bill. 6. EXPIRY / DUE DATE OF A BILL \\nThe date on which the term of the bill terminates is called as 'Expiry/Due Date of \\nthe bill'. 7.\"), Document(page_content='DAYS OF GRACE \\nEvery instrument payable otherwise than on demand is entitled to three days of \\ngrace. 8. DATE OF MATURITY OF BILL \\nThe date which comes after adding three days of grace to the expiry/due date of a \\nbill, is called the date of maturity. The maturity of a promissory note or bill of exchange is the date at which it falls \\ndue. Every promissory note or bill of exchange gets matured on the third day \\nafter the day on which it is expressed to be payable, except when it is expressed to \\nbe payable: \\ni. on demand, \\nii.'), Document(page_content='at sight, or \\niii.on presentment \\n9. BILL AT SIGHT \\nBill at Sight means the instruments in which no time for payment is mentioned. A \\ncheque is always payable on demand. A promissory note or bill of exchange is \\npayable on demand- \\na. when no time for payment is specified, or \\nb. when it is expressed to be payable on demand, or at sight or on \\npresentment.

A cheque cannot be a time instrument because the cheque is always \\npayable on demand. Though a cheque can be post dated and which can be \\npresented on or after such date. A cheque has validity of 90 days from its date \\nafter that it becomes void, normally termed as 'Stale Cheque' as bank will not \\nhonour such cheque. 11.HOW TO CALCULATE DUE DATE OF A BILL \\nThe due date of each bill is calculated as follows: \\nDetermining the Due Date of a Bill of Exchange \\nThe due date of a bill of exchange, which is when the payment must be made, \\nvaries depending on several circumstances: \\na. If the bill specifies a particular date: The due date is that exact date as \\nstated on the bill.\"), Document(page_content=\"b. If the bill specifies a payment period in months after the bill's date: The \\ndue date falls on the corresponding day of the month in which the payment \\nperiod ends. If there is no equivalent date in the final month, the due date is \\nthe last day of that month. For example, a bill dated January 31st payable in 3 \\nmonths would have a due date of April 30th. Note: The date of the bill itself is not included in the calculation. c. If the bill specifies a payment period in days after the bill's date: The due \\ndate is calculated by adding the specified number of days to the date on the \\nbill. Note: The issue date of the bill is not counted. d. If the due date falls on a public holiday: The due date is moved to the \\npreceding business day. e. If the due date falls on an emergency or unforeseen holiday: The due date \\nis deferred to the next following business day. These provisions ensure that the payment of a bill of exchange is clearly \\ndefined and that both parties are aware of their obligations and rights \\nconcerning the payment date. Note: The term of a Bill after sight commences from the date of acceptance of \\nthe bill whereas the term of a Bill after date commences from the date of drawing \\nof bill. 12.NOTING CHARGES \\nIt is necessary that the fact of dishonour and the causes of dishonour should be \\nestablished.\"), Document(page_content='If the acceptor can prove that the bill was not properly presented to \\nhim for payment, he may escape liability. Therefore, if there is dishonour, or fear \\nof dishonour, the bill will be given to a public official known as \"Notary Public\". These officials present the bill for payment and if the money is received, they will \\nhand over the money to the original party. But if the bill is dishonoured they will \\nnote the fact of dishonour, with the reasons and give the bill back to their client. For this service they charge a small fee. This fee is known as noting charges. The \\namount of noting charges is recoverable from the party which is responsible for \\ndishonour. Suppose  received from  a bill for \\n.'), Document(page_content=\"On Maturity the bill is dishonoured \\nand \\n is paid as noting charges.

In such a case a new bill will be drawn and the \\nold bill will be cancelled.\"), Document(page_content='If this happens entries should be passed for cancellation \\nof the old bill. This is done exactly as already explained for dishonour. When the \\nnew bill is received entries for the receipt of the bill will be repeated. The amount \\nof the new bill may represent any of the following: \\ni. Where the drawee pays nothing: Total of amount of original bill as well as \\nthe interest for the extended time period. ii. Where the drawee pays the interest amount at the time of renewal: \\nAmount of the Original bill. iii.Where the drawee makes part payment of the original bill or interest \\namount or both: Unpaid part of total of amount of original bill as well as the \\ninterest for the extended time period on such amount. 14.RETIREMENT OF BILLS OF EXCHANGE & REBATE \\nWe have seen that renewal of a bill of exchange is made when a person does not \\nhave sufficient fund to pay for the bill of exchange on the due date and he \\nrequires a further period of credit. Many a time instances do arise when the \\nacceptor has spare funds much before the maturity date of the bill of exchange \\naccepted by him. In such circumstances he approaches the payee of the bill of \\nexchange and asks him whether the payee is prepared to accept cash before the \\nmaturity date. In such cases the acceptor gets a certain rebate or interest or \\ndiscount for premature payment. The rebate becomes the income of the acceptor \\nand expense of the payee.'), Document(page_content=\"It is a consideration of premature payment. 15.INSOLVENCY \\nZ\\n₹1,010\\nX\\nX\\n₹1,010\\nY\\nInsolvency of a person means that he is unable to pay his liabilities. This means \\nthat bills accepted by him will be dishonoured. Therefore, when it is known that a \\nperson has become insolvent, entry for dishonour of his acceptance must be \\npassed. Later on, something may be received from his estate. When and if an \\namount is received, cash account will be debited and the personal account of the \\ndebtor will be credited. The remaining amount will be irrecoverable and, \\ntherefore, should be written off as bad debt. The students should be careful to \\ncalculate the amount actually received from an insolvent's estate and amount to \\nbe written off only after preparing his account. In the books of drawee of the bill, the amount not ultimately paid by him due to \\ninsolvency, should be credited to Deficiency Account. 16.ACCOMMODATION BILLS \\nBills of Exchange are usually drawn to facilitate trade transmission, that is, bills \\nare meant to finance actual purchase and sale of goods. But the mechanism of bill \\ncan be utilised to raise finance also.\"), Document(page_content='Suppose Boss needs finance for three \\nmonths. In that case he may persuade his friend Kapoor to accept his draft. The \\nbill of exchange may then be taken by Boss to his bank and get it discounted \\nthere. Thus, Boss will be able to make use of funds. When the three months \\nperiod expires, Boss will send the requisite amount to Kapoor and Kapoor will \\nmeet the bill. Thus, Boss is able to raise money for his use. If both Boss and \\nKapoor need money, the same devise can be used. Either Boss accepts a bill of \\nexchange or Kapoor does. In either case, the bill will be discounted with the bank \\nand the proceeds divided between the two parties according to mutual \\nagreement. The discounting charges must also be borne by the two parties in the \\nsame ratio in which the proceeds are divided. On the due date the acceptor will \\nreceive from the other party his share.'), Document(page_content='The bill will then be met. When bills are \\nused for such a purpose, they are known as accommodation bills. However, it may so happen that the drawer is not able to remit the proceeds to \\ndrawee on the due date. In such a case, the drawee may draw a bill on the drawer, \\nand get it discounted with the bank to honour the first bill. If the new drawer \\n(drawee of the first bill) also remits some proceeds of the new bill to new drawee \\n(drawer of the first bill), then the proportion of discount to be borne by the new \\ndrawee will be based upon the proceeds remitted as well as the benefit obtained \\nby him on the first bill (i.e., by not paying the amount due to the original drawee \\non due date). Entries are passed in the books of two parties exactly in the way already pointed \\nout for ordinary bills. The only additional entry to be passed is for sending the \\nremittance for one party to the other party and also debiting the other party with \\nthe shared amount of discount. 17.BILLS OF COLLECTION \\nWhen a person receives a bill of exchange, he may decide to retain the bill till the \\ndate of maturity. But in order to ensure safety, he may send it to bank with \\ninstructions that the bill should be retained till maturity and should be realised \\non that date. This does not mean discounting because the bank will not credit the \\nclient until the amount is actually realised. If the bill is sent to the bank with such \\ninstructions it is known as \"Bill sent for collection\". It is better to make a record of this also in books by passing following entry: \\nBills for Collection Account \\nDr. To Bills Receivable Account \\nWhen the amount is realised the entry will be \\nBank Account \\nDr. To Bills for Collection Account \\nWhen the amount is not honoured, the entry will be \\nDrawee\\'s A/c (from whom the bill was received) \\nDr. To Bills for collections \\n \\n18.BILLS RECEIVABLE AND BILLS PAYABLE BOOKS \\nBills receivable and bills payable books are journals (Day Books) to record in a \\nchronological order the details of bills receivable and bills payable. When large \\nnumber of bill transactions take place in an organization, it is convenient to \\nmaintain these books. Wherein any bill transaction takes place, the same is \\nentered in the Day Books in the first instance. Postings to individual Debtors or \\nCreditors accounts are made from the Day Books. Also totals of bills received or \\naccepted are posted periodically to Bills Receivable Account and Bills Payable \\nAccount respectively. Bills receivable book and bills payable book are very useful for following up the \\nstatus of outstanding bills. When there are large number of bills and these bills \\nfall due on different dates, some of these bills may not be honoured on maturity \\nA/c\\ndue to varied reasons. It is possible from these Day Books to trace the details of \\nthe outstanding bills and to identify the reasons for not honouring the bills. Given \\nbelow are forms of Day Books for both bills receivable and bills payable: \\nBills Receivable Book: \\nThis records the details of transactions where the company is entitled to receive \\nmoney. When the company receives a bill, they record the date of receipt, the \\nvoucher number which references the transaction, the name of the party from \\nwhom the bill is received, whether it is an acceptance or a bill, the date of the bill, \\nits due date for payment, the place where payment is to be made, the amount in \\nrupees, the ledger folio (L.F.) number for tracking in financial statements, and \\nthe mode of disposal, which indicates how the bill was settled or cleared. Bills Payable Book: \\nThis logs the information of transactions where the company has to pay money to \\nothers. The company notes the date when they accept the obligation to pay, the \\ndrawer of the bill, the payee to whom the payment is to be made, the date of the \\nbill, its due date, the place where the payment will be made, the amount in \\nrupees, the ledger folio (L.F.) number for reference in financial ledgers, and the \\nmode of disposal, detailing how the bill was handled or paid off. CHAPTER 7 \\nPREPARATION OF FINAL ACCOUNTS OF SOLE PROPRIETORS \\nUNIT - 1 FINAL ACCOUNTS OF NON MANUFACTURING ENTITIES \\nUnit Overview: Final Accounts of Non-Manufacturing Business Entities \\nIn the context of non-manufacturing business entities, the final accounts are \\ncrucial for determining the financial performance and position at the end of an \\naccounting period. These accounts typically include: \\n1.'), Document(page_content='Trading Account: This account is used to calculate the gross profit or loss \\nof the business. It summarizes the costs of goods sold and the revenue from \\nsales. The primary purpose of the trading account is to ascertain the \\neffectiveness of the trading activities of the entity. 2. Profit & Loss Account: Following the trading account, the profit & loss \\naccount is prepared to determine the net profit or loss for the period.

In other words, non-manufacturing entities do not process the \\ngoods purchased rather sell them in their original form. Meanwhile the entity \\nindulges in some liabilities, makes some assets and also incurs some expenses \\nlike salaries, stationery expenses, advertisement, rent etc.\"), Document(page_content=\"to run the business. At \\nthe end of the accounting year, the entity must be interested in knowing the \\nresults of the business. To ascertain the final outcome of the business i.e., the \\nincome and financial position, they prepare financial statements at the end of the \\naccounting year. Components of Financial Statements \\nFinancial statements are essential documents that provide information about a \\ncompany's financial performance and position. The primary components of \\nfinancial statements are: \\n1. Income Statement: This financial report provides details on the company's \\nrevenues and expenses over a specific accounting period, leading to the \\ndetermination of profit or loss. It includes: \\nTrading Account: This account reflects the results of the buying and selling of \\ngoods and services, leading to the calculation of gross profit or gross loss. Profit & Loss Account: It follows the trading account and shows all other \\nincomes and expenses not included in the trading account. The result is the \\nnet profit or net loss for the period.\"), Document(page_content=\"2. Position Statement: Also known as the balance sheet, this statement \\npresents the company's financial position at a specific point in time and \\nincludes: \\nBalance Sheet: This statement lists the company's assets, liabilities, and \\nequity, providing a snapshot of what the company owns and owes. It reflects \\nthe position of assets and liabilities, showing how the resources are financed, \\neither through debt or equity. These components together provide a comprehensive view of the company's \\nfinancial health, performance, and stability. Financial Statements are the systematically organized summary of all the ledger \\naccount heads and presented in such a manner that it gives detailed information \\nabout the financial position and the performance of the entity. As seen above, \\nthrough categorization of Financial Statements into Income & Position \\nStatement, the profit or loss is measured at two levels: \\na)\\nGross Profit or Gross Loss \\nb)\\nNet Profit or Net Loss \\nThe profit or loss of the enterprise is obtained through the preparation of Income \\nStatement i.e. Trading and Profit & Loss A/c \\nThe financial position of the business enterprise is assessed by measuring the \\nassets, liabilities and capital of the enterprise and the same is communicated to \\nthe users of financial statements. Financial position of the enterprise can be \\nknown through the preparation of the Position Statement i.e Balance Sheet. Comparison between Income Statement and Position Statement \\nIncome Statement: \\nThe Income Statement presents the profit or loss at the financial year's end. It's \\nsplit into two parts for non-manufacturing concerns: the Trading account, which \\ndeals with the direct costs and revenues related to sales, and the Profit and Loss \\naccount, which records indirect expenses and revenues, leading to the net profit \\nor loss after considering all the income and expenditures incurred during the \\nyear. Position Statement: \\nThe Position Statement, commonly referred to as the balance sheet, shows the \\nassets and liabilities of a business as of the financial year's end. To provide a \\nfuller picture of financial health, entities might also prepare additional \\nstatements like the cash flow statement and changes in equity statement, which, \\nwhile not mandatory for non-corporate entities, enhance understanding of the \\nbusiness's financial position, displaying the assets and liabilities as on a specific \\ndate. 2.PREPARATION OF FINAL ACCOUNTS \\nThe principal function of final accounts (Trading Account, Profit and Loss \\nAccount and the Balance Sheet) is to exhibit truly and fairly the performance and \\nthe financial position of the business to which they relate. In order that these may \\nbe properly drawn up, it is essential that a proper record of transactions entered \\ninto by the business during a particular accounting period should be maintained.\"), Document(page_content='The BASIC PRINCIPLES in regard to accumulation of accounting period data \\nare: \\ni. a distinction should be made between capital and revenue receipts and \\npayments. ii. income and expenses relating to a period of account should be separated \\nfrom those of another period. iii.different items of income and expenditure should be accumulated under \\nsignificant heads so as to disclose the sources from which capital has been \\nprocured and the nature of liabilities, which are outstanding for payment. Having regard to these basic principles, the various matters to which attention \\nshould be paid for determining the different aspects of transactions, a record of \\nwhich should be kept, and the different heads of account under which various \\nitems of income and expenditure should be accumulated, are stated below: \\na) Distinction between personal and business income:- Since the \\nfinal statements of account are intended to show the profitability of the \\nbusiness and not that of its proprietors, it is essential that all personal income \\nand expenditure should be separated from business income and expenditure. b) Distinction between capital and revenue expenditure:- A \\ndistinction should be made between capital and revenue, both receipts and \\nexpenditure. Different types of income and expenditure should be classified \\nunder separate heads. Assets should be included in the Balance Sheet by \\nfollowing accounting principles and accounting standards. Likewise, a \\nprovision for expenses which have accrued but not paid, should be made by \\nestimation or otherwise on the same basis as in the previous year. c) All material information to be disclosed:- Every information, \\nconsidered material for evaluating the performance of the business or its \\nfinancial position, should be disclosed. For example, when the labour charges \\nhave increased substantially on account of bonus having been paid to \\nworkmen, the amount of bonus paid should be disclosed.'), Document(page_content=\"Similarly, If there \\nare substantial write-offs in inventory due to any reason, it should be shown \\nseparately. d) Record only current period transactions:- Though the record of \\ntransactions should be maintained continuously, at the end of each \\naccounting period, the transactions of the closing accounting period should \\nbe cut off from those of the succeeding period. e) Only transactions completed before close of accounts should be \\ngiven effect:- It should be seen that only the effect of transactions, which \\nwere concluded before the close of period of account, has been adjusted in the \\naccounts of the year. For example, when a sale of goods is to take place only \\nafter the goods have been inspected by the purchaser and the inspection had \\nnot been made before the close of the year, it would be incorrect to treat the \\ngoods as a sale in the accounts of the year. Inter-relationship of the two statements \\nOne of the points to be remembered is that of total expenditure incurred some \\ntype of expenditure appears in the Profit and Loss Account and some in the \\nBalance Sheet. Consider few examples, \\n1. Salaries paid for current year is shown on the Dr. side of Profit and Loss \\nAccount but outstanding salaries is shown on liabilities side of Balance \\nSheet and is added to Salaries paid and shown under Profit and Loss \\nAccount. Profit & Loss Account: \\nThe Profit & Loss account records a total salary expense of ₹26,500. This \\ncomprises ₹25,000 in salaries that were paid during the period and an \\nadditional ₹1,500 in outstanding salaries that are yet to be paid. Balance Sheet: \\nIn the Balance Sheet, the outstanding salaries of ₹1,500 are recognized \\nunder liabilities, indicating an obligation that the company has yet to fulfill \\nas of the balance sheet date. 2. When a machine is purchased, that part of it which is attributable to the \\nyear considered as depreciation is debited to the Profit and Loss Account \\nand the balance amount after reducing the amount of depreciation is \\nshown in the Balance Sheet as an asset. Profit & Loss A/C: \\nIn the Profit and Loss Account, 'To Depreciation' indicates an expense of \\n₹50,000 which represents the cost of the reduction in value of fixed assets \\nduring the financial year. Balance Sheet: \\nOn the Balance Sheet, 'Fixed Assets' are initially recorded at a cost of \\n₹5,00,000. The 'Less: Depreciation' entry shows a deduction of ₹50,000 \\nfrom the fixed assets, reflecting the depreciation expense recognized in the \\nProfit & Loss Account, resulting in a net book value of ₹4,50,000 for the \\nfixed assets. These illustrations show that the two statements, the Profit and Loss Account and \\nthe Balance Sheet, are thoroughly inter-related.\"), Document(page_content='The assets shown in the Balance \\nSheet are mostly only the remainder of the expenditure incurred after a suitable \\namount has been charged to the Profit and Loss Account or the Trading Account. For preparing the two statements properly, it is of the greatest importance that \\nthe amounts to be charged to the Profit and Loss Account should be properly \\ndetermined otherwise both statements will show an incorrect position. The \\nprinciple that governs this concept is called the Matching Principle. Matching Principle \\nThis principle demands that expenses incurred to earn the revenue should be \\nproperly matched. This means the following: \\na) If a certain revenue and income is entered in the Trading / Profit and Loss \\nAccount all the expenses relating to it, whether or not payment has been \\nactually made, should be debited to the Trading / Profit and Loss Account. This is why at the end of the year an entry is recorded to bring into account \\nthe outstanding expenses. That is also the reason why the opening inventory \\nof goods is debited to the Trading Account since the relevant sale is credited \\nin the same account. b) If some expense has been incurred but against it sale will take place in the \\nnext year or income will be received next year, the expense should not be \\ndebited to the current year\\'s Profit and Loss Account but should be carried \\nforward as an asset and shown in the Balance Sheet. It will be debited to the \\nProfit and Loss Account only when the relevant income will also be credited. The same reason applies to depreciation of assets also. The part of the cost \\nwhich is used to earn current year revenue is debited in same year. c) If an income or revenue is received in the current year but the work \\nagainst it has to be done and the cost in respect of it has to be incurred next \\nyear, i.e. income received in advance, such income or the revenue is \\nconsidered to be of next year. It should be shown in the Balance Sheet on the \\nliabilities side as \"income received in advance\" and should be credited to the \\nProfit and Loss Account of the next year. E.g.'), Document(page_content=\"Newspapers or magazines \\nusually receive subscriptions in advance for a year. The part of subscription \\nthat covers copies to be supplied in the next year is treated as income \\nreceived in advance. An exception \\nThere appears to be one exception to the rule that only such costs as have yielded \\nor is expected to yield revenue should only be debited to Profit and Loss Account. For example, if a fire has occurred and has damaged the firm's property the loss \\nmust be debited to the Profit and Loss Account to the extent it is not covered by \\ninsurance. A loss, resulting from the fall of selling price below the cost or from \\nsome debts turning bad, must similarly be debited to the Profit and Loss Account. If this is not done the profit will be over-stated. (NOTE: - The relevant entries and adjustments regarding the above three items \\nare discussed in detail later in this unit.) \\n3.TRADING ACCOUNT \\nAt the end of the year, as has been seen above, it is necessary to ascertain the net \\nprofit or the net loss. For this purpose, it is first necessary to know the gross \\nprofit or gross loss. Gross Profit is the difference between the selling price and the \\ncost of the goods sold. For a trading firm, the cost of goods sold can be \\nascertained by adjusting the cost of goods still on hand at the end of the year \\nagainst the purchases. It is done as follow:- \\nOpening Stock *** \\nAdd: Purchases (Net) ** \\nAdd: Direct Expenses ** \\nLess: Cost of Goods Sold (**) \\nClosing Stock *** \\nSuppose, in the first year, the net purchases (that is after deducting returns) total \\n and that \\n worth of goods (at cost) were not sold at the end of \\nthe year. The cost of the goods sold will then be \\n. If in the next year \\npurchases are \\n, direct expenses are \\n and the cost of goods sold \\nis \\n the closing stock will be \\n calculated as follows: \\nCost of unsold goods at the beginning of the year 15,000 \\nPurchases during the year \\n \\nDirect Expenses \\n \\n \\nLess: Cost of sold goods during the year \\n \\nClosing Stock \\n \\nGross profit is usually ascertained by preparing a Trading account. The format of \\nTrading Account can be shown as below:- \\nTrading Account for the year ended: \\nDebit Side: \\nTo Opening Stock: XXX \\nTo Purchases: XXX \\nLess: Returns outward: XXX \\nTo Direct Expenses: \\nFreight & Carriage: XXX \\nCustoms & Insurance: XXX \\nWages: XXX \\nGas, Water & Fuel: XXX \\nFactory Expenses: XXX \\nRoyalty on Production: XXX \\nTotal Direct Expenses: XXX \\n₹1,00, 000\\n₹15,000\\n₹85,000\\n₹1,50, 000\\n₹10,000\\n₹1,45, 000\\n₹30,000\\n1,50, 000\\n10,000\\n_ 1,75, 000\\n1,45, 000\\n(30,000)\\nCredit Side: \\nBy Sales: XXX \\nLess: Returns Inwards: XXX \\nBy Closing Stock: XXX \\nBy Gross Loss c/d*: XXX \\nTo Gross Profit c/d* \\n*Only one will appear \\nIf in the above example net sales, i.e., after adjustment for sales returns, is ₹ \\n2,00,000 then the gross profit will be ₹ 55,000 , i.e., ₹2,00,000 - ₹ \\n. This profit is called gross profit since from it indirect expenses have still to be \\ndeducted for knowing the net profit. Now, for the same example Trading account \\nwill appear as follows:- \\nTrading Account for the year ending \\nTo Opening Inventory: ₹15,000 \\nTo Purchase Account: ₹1,50,000 \\nTo Direct Expenses: ₹10,000 \\nTo Gross Profit carried to P & L A/c: ₹55,000 \\nTotal: ₹2,30,000 \\nBy Sales Account: ₹2,00,000 \\nBy Closing Inventory: ₹30,000 \\nTotal: ₹2,30,000 \\nPoint to Remember:- \\n•\\nThe opening inventory and purchases are written on the debt side. •\\nSales and the closing inventory are entered on the credit side. •\\nIf there are any direct expenses then they should also be written on the \\ndebit side of the Trading account. 1,45, 000\\n•\\nIf the balances of credit side is more, the difference is written on the debit \\nside as gross profit. This amount will also be carried forward to the Profit \\nand Loss Account on the credit side. •\\nIn case of gross loss, i.e., when the debit side of the Trading Account \\nexceeds the credit side, the amount will be written on the credit side of the \\nTrading Account and transferred to the debit side of the Profit and Loss \\nAccount. Trading Account Items \\nIn a trading firm like a wholesaler, the main business consists of buying and \\nselling the same goods. In addition to the amount of the opening inventory, the \\ntrading account will also be debited with all expenses incurred in bringing the \\ngoods to the godown of the firm (i.e. to the present condition and location) and in \\nmaking them ready for sale. For example, freight paid on purchases, cartage, octroi, etc. will all be debited to \\nthe Trading Account. The rule is that this account will be debited with all \\nexpenses incurred in bringing the goods to their present location and condition. We shall now consider individual items: \\n1. Opening Inventory: Since this was closing inventory of the last year, it \\nmust have been entered in the opening inventory account, through the \\nopening entry. Therefore, it will be found in the trial balance. This item is \\nusually put as the first item on the debit side of the Trading Account.

Of \\ncourse, damaged or obsolete items are separately listed. To the list of finished \\ngoods, one should also add the goods lying with agents sent to them on \\nconsignment basis and also the goods sent on approval to customer.

The adjustment will be necessary because, in the meantime, purchases and sales \\nmust have been made. The main point to remember is that in respect of sales \\ntheir cost has been established. Cost will be sales less gross profit. Below is the summary for all transfer / closing entries to Trading a/c: \\n1.

If there is \\ngross loss, it will be written on the debit side. After that all those expenses and \\nlosses, which have not been entered in the Trading Account, will be written on \\nthe debit side of Profit and Loss Account. Incomes and gains, other than sales, \\nwill be written on the credit side. If we understand word 'expenses' properly, there should be no difficulty in \\ndistinguishing between items that will be debited to the Profit and Loss Account \\nand those that will be shown as Assets in the balance sheet. Further, it may be \\nnoted that the expenses which are personal in nature will not be charged to Profit \\nand Loss A/c. Only those revenue expenses and losses which are related to the \\ncurrent year, are debited to Profit and Loss Account. It is desirable, according to modern thinking that the Profit and Loss Account \\nshould be prepared in such a manner as will enable the reader to form a correct \\nidea about the profit earned or loss incurred by the firm during the period \\ntogether with the significant factor. Too many details will prevent a person from \\nknowing properly the factors leading to the profit earned. Therefore, items should \\nbe according to the various functions, such as administrations, selling and \\nfinancing. The profit/loss \\n appears as follows:- \\nProfit and Loss Account for the year ended: \\nDebit Side: \\nTo Gross Loss b/d (brought down) \\nManagement Expenses: \\nTo Salaries (administrative) \\nTo Office rent, rates, and taxes \\nTo Printing and stationery \\nTo Telephone charges \\nTo Postage \\nTo Insurance \\nTo Audit Fees \\nTo Legal Charges \\nTo Electricity Charges \\nMaintenance Expenses: \\nTo Repairs & renewals \\nTo Depreciation on Office Equipment, Office Furniture, Office Buildings \\nSelling and Distribution Expenses: \\nTo Salaries (selling staff) \\nTo Advertisement \\nTo Godown rent \\nA/c\\nTo Carriage Outward \\nTo Bad Debts \\nTo Provision for bad debts \\nTo Selling commission \\nFinancial Expenses: \\nTo Bank charges \\nTo Interest on loans \\nTo Discount on bills \\nTo Discount allowed to customers \\nAbnormal Losses: \\nTo Loss on sale of machinery \\nTo Loss on sale of investment \\nTo Loss by fire \\nTo Net Profit (transferred to Capital A/c) \\nCredit Side: \\nBy Gross Profit b/d (brought down) \\nOther Income: \\nBy Discount Received \\nBy Commission Received \\nNon-trading Income: \\nBy Bank Interest \\nBy Rent of property let-out \\nBy Dividend from investment in shares \\nAbnormal Gains: \\nBy Profit on sale of machinery \\nBy Profit on sale of investment \\nBy Net Loss (transferred to Capital A/c) \\nNote: \\ni. Gross loss appears in the debit side of the Profit and Loss Account at the \\ntop; while Gross Profit on the credit side. ii. Net loss appears in the credit side of the Profit and Loss Account; while \\nNet profit on debit side as balancing figures. It will be good idea to either show these expenses in a separate schedule or to \\nindicate the total of these prominently in the Profit and Loss Account. This rule \\nshould be followed wherever the number of items is rather large. CLOSING ENTRIES \\nThe entries that have to be made in the journal for preparing the Trading and the \\nProfit and Loss Account that is for transferring the various accounts to these two \\naccounts are known as closing entries. We have already seen the entries required \\nfor preparing the Trading Account and for transferring the gross profit to the \\nprofit and Loss Account. Now to complete the Profit and Loss Account, the under \\nmentioned three entries will be necessary. a) For items to be debited to the Profit and Loss Account this account will be \\ndebited and the various accounts concerned will be credited. For example, \\nProfit and Loss Account \\nDr. To Salaries Account \\nTo Rent Account \\nTo Interest Account \\nTo Other Expenses Account \\nb) Items of income or gain such as interest received or miscellaneous income \\nwill be credited to Profit and Loss Account. Discount Received Account Dr. Bad debts Recovered Account Dr. To Profit and Loss Account \\nc) At this stage, the Profit and Loss Account will show net profit or net loss. Both have to be transferred to the Capital Account. In case of net profit, i.e., when the credit side is bigger than the debit side, the \\nentry is: \\nProfit and Loss Account \\nDr. To Capital Account \\nIn the case of net loss, the entry will be \\nCapital Account \\nDr. To Profit and Loss Account \\nEntries in detail \\nThere may be other income such as interest received, discount received, rent \\nfrom subletting of premises, miscellaneous incomes such as from sale of junk \\nmaterial etc., It would be desirable to show the totals only under each of the main \\ncategories of income. However, interest on fixed deposits, interests or income \\nfrom investments and other interest should be shown separately.\"), Document(page_content=\"Similarly, items \\nwhich have to be debited/credited to the proprietor should be segregated from \\nother items. Examples would be interest charged on drawings, interest allowed \\non capital and charges for services rendered by the firm to the proprietor \\npersonally. We shall now consider a few items individually: \\ni. Drawings: Drawings are not expenses for the firm but reduction of \\ncapital and therefore should not be debited to the Profit and Loss Account \\nbut to Capital account of the proprietor. Capital A/C Dr. To Drawings \\nIf the proprietor has enjoyed some benefit personally, like use of the firm's car, a \\nsuitable amount should be treated as drawing and to that extent the charge to the \\nProfit and Loss Account will be reduced, Drawings are debited to the proprietor's \\ncapital account. ii.\"), Document(page_content=\"Income Tax: In case of companies, the income tax payable is treated like \\nother expenses.

Capital A/c \\nDr. To Income Tax A/c \\nThis is because the amount of the tax will depend on the total income of the \\npartners or proprietor besides the profit of the firm. In case of partnership \\nbusiness, firm's tax liability is to be debited to profit and loss account of the firm \\nbut partners' tax liability are not to be borne by the firm. Therefore if the firm \\npays income tax on behalf of partners, such payment of personal income tax \\nshould be treated as drawings. iii.Discount received and allowed: We have already seen that discount is \\nof two types.\"), Document(page_content=\"Trade discount and Cash discount. Trade discount is allowed \\nwhen the order for goods is not below a certain figure. It is deducted from the \\ninvoice. Only the net amount of invoice is entered in books. There is no \\nfurther treatment of the trade discount. Cash discount is allowed to a \\ncustomer if he makes the payment before a certain date. It is allowance made \\nto him for prompt payment and is recorded in the books. Therefore, \\nTrade discount is not debited to \\n account because it is already adjusted in \\nsales, but cash discount is debited to \\n account. Discount received is a gain and is credited to the Profit and Loss Account while \\ndiscount allowed is a loss and debited to Profit and Loss Account.

Another customer's purchases total \\n, he will get a rebate of ₹ \\n204 . The entry for rebate is made only at the end of the year.

Therefore, the bad debts account is debited, which is later on \\ntransferred in the Profit and Loss Account on the debit side.

Adjustments \\nThe fundamental principle of accounting is that the period to which various items \\nof income and expenditure pertain should be co-extensive with the period of \\naccount. As such before final accounts are drawn up, it must be ensured that the \\naccounts which require adjustment on this consideration have been adjusted, \\nboth by providing for expense accrued and including income outstanding and \\nexcluding expenses the benefit of which extends beyond the year of account as \\nwell as the income received in advance.

Where an examination problem \\nrequires that certain bad debts should be written off and a provision for doubtful \\ndebts made, the amount of bad debts to be written off should be first debited \\nagainst the existing balance of the provision and the resulting balance in the \\naccount afterwards should be raised to the required figure. The method is \\nillustrated below: \\n7) Provision for Discount: This provision is created in the same manner, \\ndiscussed above but the amount of provision is required to be calculated after \\ndeducting the Provision for Bad Debts from the total trade receivables.

The other way is to start with short-term \\nliabilities and then show long term liabilities and last of all capital. CLASSIFICATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\nAssets are basically of following types: \\nCurrent Assets: - these assets are meant to be converted into cash as quickly as \\npossible. Generally, within one year.'), Document(page_content='For example:- Cash in hand, Cash at Bank, \\nTrade receivables, Inventories. Long Term Assets: - Those that are meant to be used by the firm over a long \\nperiod and not sold the former type of assets is also called fixed assets. For \\nexample:- Machinery, Building, Long term Investment. Intangible Assets: - the assets which have no physical existence and cannot be \\nseen or touched are called as Intangible Assets.

The first entry in the journal is to record the closing balances of \\nvarious assets and liabilities at the end of the previous year as the opening \\nbalances in the beginning of the new year. The balance sheet prepared at the end \\nof the year records these balances and is the basis for this first entry. It is called \\nthe opening entry.'), Document(page_content='The assets shown in the balance sheet are debited and the liabilities and the \\ncapital account credited. 9.PROVISIONS AND RESERVES \\nProvision means \"any amount written off or retained by way of providing for \\ndepreciation, renewal or diminution in the value of assets or retained by way of \\nproviding for any known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with \\nsubstantial accuracy\". A provision is a liability which can be measured only by \\nusing a substantial degree of estimation. Thus, a provision may be either in respect of loss in the value of an asset provided \\nor written off on the basis of an estimate or the one in respect of a liability for \\nexpenses incurred in respect of a claim which is disputed i.e. when it is a \\ncontingent liability. On the occurrence of a diminution in asset values due to \\nsome of them having become irrecoverable or Inventory items are lost as a result \\nof some natural calamity, amounts contributed or transferred from profit to make \\ngood the diminution also are described as provision. The following are instances of amount retained in the business out of earning for \\ndifferent purposes that are described as provisions. 1) Amount provided for meeting claims which are admissible in principle, \\nbut the amount whereof has not been ascertained. 2) An appropriation made for payment of taxes still to be assessed. 3) Amount set aside for writing off bad debts or payment of discounts. The portion of earnings, receipts or other surplus of an enterprise (whether \\ncapital or revenue) appropriated by the management for a general or a specific \\npurpose other than a provision for depreciation or diminution in the value of \\nassets or for a known liability is known as reserves. The reserves are primarily of \\ntwo types: capital reserves and revenue reserves. Also provisions in excess of the \\namount considered necessary for the purposes these were originally made, are to \\nbe considered as reserves. It is thus evident that provisions are a charge against \\nprofits, while reserve is an appropriation of profits. Also provisions that \\nultimately prove to be in excess of amounts required or have been made too \\nliberally are reserves. Such a distinction is essential for disclosing truly in the \\nBalance Sheet the amount by which the equity of shareholders has increased with \\nthe accumulation of undistributed profits. Reserve Fund: It signifies the amount standing to the credit of the reserve that is \\ninvested outside the business in securities which are readily realisable e.g., when \\nthe amounts set apart for replacement of an asset are invested periodically, in \\ngovernment securities or shares. The account to which these amounts are \\nannually credited is described as the Reserve Fund. 10.LIMITATIONS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFinancial statements suffer from a number of limitations.'), Document(page_content='These must, therefore, \\nbe studied with care, in order that correct inferences may be drawn. The \\nlimitations are less serious if the objective is only to appraise the performance of \\na single company over a period of year Where, however, a comparison of the \\nworking of different companies for the same period is to be made. It can be \\nmisleading unless the companies concerned have followed the same system and \\nbasis of accounting. On the account, a comparison of the performancey of \\ndifferent industries on the basis of financial statements, should be undertaken \\nonly if it is not practicable to make such a comparison on any other basis. The principal limitations affecting financial statements are the following: \\na) Historical Cost: Accounting records and, on that account, the financial \\nstatements are prepared only on the basis of the money value prevailing at \\nthe time the transaction were entered into. Thus, the effect of subsequent \\nchanges in the value of money is not taken into account.'), Document(page_content=\"At times this has the \\neffect of making the statements of account quite misleading. Take the obvious \\nexample of a house built in 1980, say at the cost of \\n, in 2022 the \\nbenefit receivable from its occupation will be as much as that of a house \\ncreated in 2022 , say at a cost of \\n. If the house were included in \\nthe financial statements at its original cost, as normally it would not convey a \\ntrue picture except to a knowledgeable person. The limitations can be serious in the case of other fixed assets that have been \\nworking over a long period over which prices have changed radically. It is, \\nhowever, not easy to get over this difficulty, since revaluation of fixed assets, \\napart from being costly is not practicable when the value of money is \\ncontinuously falling. On this account, historical cost continues to be the accepted \\nbasis for the preparation of financial statements. Though it may not be possible \\nto do much to remove the limitation mentioned above, one must always \\nremember to read the balance sheet and the profit and loss account in the light of \\nwhat they cannot reveal as well as what they do. b) Intangible strengths and weaknesses: A company may have a \\nnumber of strengths and weaknesses which cannot be shown in the balance \\nsheet e.g., the loyalty and calibre of its staff. These must be kept in mind \\nwhile judging the financial position of the company. c) Perpetual continuity and periodical account: Financial statements \\nordinarily are drawn up at the end of each year but the accounting record is \\nmaintained on the assumption that the business undertaking shall continue \\nto exist forever on the basis of going concern assumption. In consequence, \\nmuch of the expenditure other than revenue expenditure has to be \\ndistributed arbitrarily over a number of years during which benefit of the \\n₹15,000\\n₹30,00, 000\\nexpenditure is expected to arise. As a result, financial statements of account \\nare not absolutely correct. d) Different accounting policies: It is permissible for a company within \\ncertain limits to adopt different policies for the preparation of accounts, \\nvaluation of various assets and distribution of expenditure over different \\nperiods of account. For example, a company may decide to provide annually \\nfor payment of pensions and gratuities to staff and thus build up a 'fund' out \\nof which payments will be made ultimately whereas another company may \\ndeal with these only when actual payments are made. Similarly, a company \\nmay decide whether or not to include intangible assets amongst its assets or \\nmanner in which the amounts thereof should be written off. e) Management policies: Management can have different accounting \\npolicies for welfare of the staff and public at large. UNIT - 2 FINAL ACCOUNTS OF MANUFACTURING ENTITIES \\n2.1.INTRODUCTION \\nThe manufacturing entities generally prepare a separate Manufacturing Account \\nas a part of Final accounts in addition to Trading Account, Profit and Loss \\nAccount and Balance Sheet. The objective of preparing Manufacturing Account is \\nto determine manufacturing costs of finished goods for assessing the cost \\neffectiveness of manufacturing activities. Manufacturing costs of finished goods \\nare then transferred from the Manufacturing Account to Trading Account. a) Trading account shows Gross Profit while Manufacturing Account shows \\ncost of goods sold which includes direct expenses. b) Manufacturing account also deals with the raw materials, and work in \\nprogress while the trading account would deal with finished goods only. 2.2.PURPOSE \\nA manufacturing account serves the following functions: \\n1) It shows the total cost of manufacturing the finished products and sets out \\nin detail, with appropriate classifications, the constituent elements of such \\ncost. It is, therefore, debited with the cost of materials, manufacturing wages \\nand expenses incurred directly or indirectly to manufacture. 2) It provides details of factory cost and facilitates reconciliation of financial \\nbooks with cost records. It also serves as a basis of comparison of \\nmanufacturing operations from period to period. 3) The Manufacturing Account may also be used for various other purposes. For example, if the output is carried to the Trading Account at market prices, \\nit shows the profit or loss on manufacture. Similarly, it may also be used to fix \\nthe amount of production linked bonus when such schemes are in force. 2.3.MANUFACTURING COSTS \\nManufacturing costs are classified into: \\n \\nRaw Material consumed is arrived at after adjustment of opening and closing \\nInventory of raw materials: \\n\\xa0+\\xa0Raw\\xa0Material\\xa0Consumed\\xa0\\n\\xa0+\\xa0Direct\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0Wages\\xa0\\n\\xa0+\\xa0Direct\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0Expenses\\xa0\\n\\xa0+\\xa0Direct\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0Cost\\xa0\\n\\xa0+\\xa0Indirect\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0expenses\\xa0or\\xa0\\n\\xa0+\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0Overhead\\xa0\\n\\xa0Total\\xa0Manufacturing\\xa0Cost\\xa0\\nRaw Material Consumed  Opening inventory + Purchases - Closing inventory of \\nRaw Materials of Raw Materials \\nIf there remain unfinished goods at the beginning and at the end of the \\naccounting period, cost of such unfinished goods (also termed as Work-In-\\nProcess) is shown in the Manufacturing Account. Opening inventory of Work-in-Process is posted to the debit of the \\nManufacturing Account and closing inventory of Work-in-Process is posted to the \\ncredit of the Manufacturing Account. DIRECT MANUFACTURING EXPENSES \\nDirect manufacturing expenses are costs, other than material or wages, which are \\nincurred for a specific product or saleable service. Examples of direct manufacturing expenses are (i) Royalties for using license or \\ntechnology if based on units produced, (ii) Hire charge of the plant and \\nmachinery used on hire, if based on units produced, etc. When royalty or hire charges are based on units produced, these expenses \\ndirectly vary with production. INDIRECT MANUFACTURING EXPENSES OR OVERHEAD \\nEXPENSES \\nThese are also called Manufacturing overhead, Production overhead, Works \\noverhead, etc. Overhead is defined as total cost of indirect material, indirect \\nwages and indirect expenses. Overhead = Indirect Material + Indirect Wages + Indirect Expenses \\nIndirect material means materials which cannot be linked directly with the \\nunits produced, for example, stores consumed for repair and maintenance work, \\nsmall tools, fuel and lubricating oil, etc. Indirect wages are those which cannot be directly linked to the units produced, \\nfor example, wages for maintenance works, holding pay, etc. Indirect expenses are those which cannot be directly linked to the units \\nproduced, for example, training expenses, depreciation of plant and machinery, \\ndepreciation of factory shed, insurance premium for plant and machinery, factory \\nshed, etc. Accordingly, indirect manufacturing expenses comprise indirect material, \\nindirect wages and indirect expenses of the manufacturing division. =\\nBY-PRODUCTS \\nIn most manufacturing operations, the production of the main product is \\naccompanied by the production of a subsidiary product which has a value on sale.\"), Document(page_content='For example, the production of hydrogenated vegetable oil is accompanied by the \\nproduction of oxygen gas and the production of steel yields scrap. The subsidiary \\nproduct is termed as a by-product because its production is not consciously \\nundertaken but results out of the production of the main product. It is usually \\nvery difficult to ascertain the cost of the product. Moreover, its value usually \\nforms a very small percentage of the main product. By-product is a secondary product. This is produced from the same raw \\nmaterials, which are used for producing the main product and without incurring \\nany additional expenses from the same production process in which the main \\nproduct is produced. Some examples of byproduct are given below: \\ni. Molasses is the by-product in sugar manufacturing; \\nii. Butter milk is the by-product of a dairy which produces butter and cheese, \\netc.'), Document(page_content='By-products generally have insignificant value as compared to the value of main \\nproduct.'), Document(page_content='They are generally valued at net realizable value, if their costs \\ncannot be separately identified. It is often treated, as Other Operating income\" \\nbut the correct treatment would be to credit the sale value of the by-product to \\nManufacturing Account so as to reduce to that extent, the cost of manufacture of \\nmain product. 2.4.DESIGN OF A MANUFACTURING ACCOUNT \\nThere is no standardized design for the presentation of a Manufacturing Account. Given below is a format covering various elements: \\nManufacturing Account \\nManufacturing Account: \\nDebit Side: \\nTo Raw Material Consumed: \\nOpening inventory \\nAdd: Purchases \\nLess: Closing inventory \\nTo Direct Wages \\nTo Direct expenses: \\nPrime cost \\nTo Factory overheads: \\nRoyalty \\nHire charges \\nTo Indirect expenses: \\nRepairs & Maintenance \\nDepreciation \\nTo Opening Work-in-process \\nCredit Side: \\nBy By-products at net realizable value \\nBy Closing Work-in-Process \\nBy Trading A/C: \\nCost of production \\nTutorial Note: Frequently, problems are set, in which all the ledger balances \\nare not given. Instead, details are given regarding the number of items in \\nInventories, quantity manufactured etc.'), Document(page_content='the figures for Inventories, sales etc., \\nwould therefore have to be worked out independently from the data given. The following general rules may be observed. (a) The Manufacturing Account should have columns showing the quantities and \\nvalues. Frequently, all the quantities are not given and the quantities \\napplicable to one or more of the items would have to be worked out. For \\nexample, if the question does not state the total number of items sold, the \\nquantity can be worked out by adding opening inventory and units \\nmanufactured and deducting closing inventory. It is, therefore, useful to have \\nquantity columns in the account so that it can be seen that both sides balance. (b) The Manufacturing Account will show the quantity of raw materials in \\ninventory at the beginning and at the end of the year and the purchases \\nduring the year. As regards finished goods, it will only show the quantity \\nmanufactured and, as regards work-in-progress, the opening and closing \\namounts. (c) The Trading Account will show the quantities of finished goods manufactured \\nand sold and the opening and closing inventory. It will not show the quantity \\nof raw materials or workin-progress. (d) For determining the value of closing inventory, in the absence of specific \\ninstruction to the contrary, it must be assumed that sales have been on \"first \\nin-first out\" basis, that is, the closing inventory consists as far as possible of \\ngoods produced during the year, the opening inventory being sold out. It may be mentioned here that nowadays no manufacturing business entity \\nprepares manufacturing account as part of its final set of accounts.'), Document(page_content='Even the \\nitems of manufacturing account are shown either in trading account (in case of \\nnon-corporate entities) or in Statement of profit and loss (in case of corporate \\nentities). The procedure of preparation of Trading Account, Profit and Loss Account and \\nBalance Sheet have already been explained in Unit 1 of this chapter. Students \\nshould refer the earlier unit for attempting the problems based on the \\npreparation of complete set of final accounts of a sole proprietor. CHAPTER 8 \\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTSOF NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANISATIONS \\n1. INTRODUCTION \\nA non-profit organization is a legal accounting entity that is operated for the \\nbenefit of the society as a whole, rather than for the benefit of a sole proprietor or \\na group of partners or shareholders. The main motive behind the non-profitable \\norganization is to render service to the society or the members of the \\norganisation. There is difference in the final accounts prepared between the profit making and \\nthe nonprofitable organisations. The sources of receipts and payments also vary \\nwith the nature of the activity that is being carried on by the organisation. Non-\\nprofit making organisations such as public hospitals, public educational \\ninstitutions, clubs, Temples, churches etc., as a part of their final accounts \\nprepare Receipts and Payments Account and Income and Expenditure Account to \\nshow periodic performance (either surplus or deficit) and Balance Sheet to show \\nfinancial position at the end of the period. In this Chapter, we shall discuss the \\ntechnique of preparing Receipts and Payments Account, Income and Expenditure \\nAccounts and Balance Sheet of not-for-profit organisations. The Income and Expenditure Account (non- profitable organisation) is just \\nsimilar to Profit and Loss Account prepared for the profit making organisations \\nbut there has been different terminology employed for the word Profit as \\nSURPLUS - excess of income over expenditure or loss as DEFICIT - excess of \\nexpenditure over income. In non-profit making organisations, total cash receipts \\nand total cash payments are highlighted through Receipts and Payments \\nAccount.'), Document(page_content='2. NATURE OF RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS ACCOUNT \\nA Receipts and Payments Account is a summary of the cash book without date \\ncolumn. It is an elementary form of account commonly adopted by not for profit \\nmaking concerns such as hospitals, clubs, societies, temples, churches etc., for \\npresenting the receipts and payments periodically together with the cash \\nbalances at the beginning and close of the period. The receipts are entered on the \\nleft hand side, and payments on the right hand side i.e., the same way as they \\nappear in Cash Book. \"The main point to be noted here is that- receipts and \\npayments account is not based on the accrual system of book keeping as it \\nrecords all the receipts and payments whether capital or revenue, pertaining to \\nthe current, previous or future periods.\" \\nFeatures: \\n•\\nIt is the summary of the cash and bank transactions like cash book, all the \\nreceipts (capital or revenue) are debited, similarly, all the expenditures \\n(capital or revenue) are credited. •\\nIt starts with opening cash and bank balances and also ends with their \\nclosing balances.'), Document(page_content='This account is usually not a part of the double entry \\nsystem as it includes all cash and bank receipts and payments, whether \\nthey are related to present, past or future periods. •\\nSurplus or deficit for an accounting period cannot be ascertained from this \\naccount, since, it shows only the Cash/Bank position and excludes all non \\ncash items. 2.1 Limitations of Receipts and Payments Account \\nFrom the study of the above account, it is apparent that the increase in the cash \\nand bank balances at the end of the year, as compared to those in beginning, does \\nnot truly represent the surplus for the year since it does not take into account the \\nother important transactions, such as cost of construction of the pavilion, which \\nis in excess of the donation received, the outstanding subscription or those which \\nwere collected in advance, etc. Another important drawback is that the Receipts and Payments Account includes \\nitems relating to all periods and of all types whether capital or revenue. In order \\nto ascertain whether the organisation has made surplus or deficit, there is a need \\nto construct an account which considers all the relevant revenue transactions for \\nthe current period. Since the Receipts and payments account does not consider \\nthe above, its preparation is not favoured except where the activities of the \\norganization, the results of which are to be exhibited, are simple and modest, \\ninvolve no carry over from one period to the next and it has no assets, apart from \\ncash balance and no liabilities. 3. INCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT \\nThe income and expenditure account is equivalent to the Profit and Loss Account \\nof a Profit making business enterprise. It is an account which is widely adopted \\nby most of the Nonprofit making concerns and is prepared by following accrual \\nprinciple. Only items of revenue nature pertaining to the current period of \\naccount are included. The preparation of the account, therefore, requires \\nadjustments in relevant accounts in respect of both outstanding and advance \\nitems of income and expenditure. The only difference is in the terms used to \\nrepresent the profit and loss. Profit is termed as Surplus- Excess of income over \\nexpenditure and loss is termed as Deficit- Excess of expenditure over income. Non-profit organizations registered under section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013 \\nare required to prepare their Income and Expenditure account and Balance Sheet \\nas per the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Features: \\n•\\nIt is a revenue account prepared at the end of the accounting period for \\nfinding out the surplus or deficit of that period.'), Document(page_content='•\\nIt is prepared by matching expenses against the revenue of that period \\nconcerned.'), Document(page_content='•\\nBoth cash and non-cash items, such as depreciation, are taken into \\nconsideration. •\\nAll capital expenditures and incomes are excluded.'), Document(page_content=\"•\\nOnly current years' income and expenses are considered. This Surplus/\\ndeficit is taken to the balance sheet and is added / deducted respectively \\nwith the capital fund (opening balance). 3.1.Main Sources of Income \\nFor a not for profit organisation, the sources of income, largely depend on the \\nnature of the activity carried on by them.\"), Document(page_content='The income for a charitable hospital is \\ndifferent from that of a income received by a sports club. Broadly for the \\npurposes of solving the illustrations, we can classify the sources of income as \\nsubscriptions, ordinary donations, membership fees or entrances fees (if the \\namount is normal or provided according to bye-laws of the society), recurring \\ngrants from local authorities and income from investments, etc. Any amount raised for a special activity, e.g.'), Document(page_content='on sale of match tickets, is deducted \\nfrom the expenditure of that activity and net amount is shown in the income and \\nexpenditure account. Any receipt of capital nature shall not be shown as income \\nbut will be credited to the Capital Fund or special purpose fund e.g. \"Building \\nFund\\' or if the receipts is on account of sale of a fixed asset, it shall be credited to \\nthe asset account. This system of showing the donation towards specific purposes \\nseparately is termed as fund accounting. 3.2.Distinction between Receipts and Payments Account and Income \\nand Expenditure Account \\nNot for profit organizations such as public hospitals, public educational \\ninstitutions, clubs, Temples, churches etc., conventionally prepare Receipt and \\nPayment Account and Income and Expenditure Account to show periodic \\nperformance for a particular accounting period. The distinguishing features of \\nboth the accounts can be summarized as: \\nReceipt and Payment Account is an elementary form of account consisting of a \\nclassified summary of cash receipts and payments over a certain period together \\nwith cash balances at the beginning and close of the period. The receipts are \\nentered on the left hand side and payments on the right hand side i.e.'), Document(page_content='same sides \\nas those on which they appear in cash book. All the receipts and payments \\nwhether of revenue or capital nature are included in this account. The receipts \\nand payments pertaining to the current, previous or future periods are also \\nconsidered here. The balance of the account at the end of a period represents the \\ndifference between the amount of cash received and paid up. It is always in debit \\nsince it is made up of cash in hand and at bank. Income and expenditure account resembles and is drawn in the same form of a \\nProfit and loss account in case of profit-making organisations. Expenditure of \\nrevenue nature is shown on the debit side, income and gains of revenue nature \\nare shown on the credit side. Income and Expenditure Account contains all the \\nitems of income and expenditure relevant to the current accounting period only, \\nwhether received or paid as well as that which have fallen due for recovery or \\npayment. Capital Receipts, prepayments of income and capital expenditures, \\nprepaid expenses are excluded. It does not start with any opening balance. The \\nbalancing figure represents the amount by which the income exceeds the \\nexpenditure or vice versa. 3.3.Preparation of Income and Expenditure Account from Receipts \\nand Payments Account \\nSituations may require compilation of Income and Expenditure Account and the \\nBalance Sheet from the Receipts and Payments Account after making \\nadjustments in respect of Income accrued but not collected and expenses \\noutstanding. The preparation of Balance Sheet in such a case is also necessary \\nsince an Income and Expenditure Account must always be accompanied by a \\nBalance Sheet. The procedure which should be followed in this regard is briefly \\noutlined below.'), Document(page_content='i. Compute the opening balance of the Accumulated Fund, or Capital Fund \\nof the Institution with the help of making opening balance sheet. It will be \\nexcess of the total value of the assets over that of the liabilities at the \\ncommencement of the period.'), Document(page_content='ii.'), Document(page_content='Open ledger accounts in respect of various items of income and \\nexpenditure (e.g. subscription, rents, printing, purchase of sports materials \\netc.) in which accruals or outstanding at the beginning or at the end of period \\nhave to be adjusted. Enter therein any accrual or outstanding at the end of \\nthe period as well as amounts which relate to an earlier period or the \\nfollowing period. The balance of the ledger accounts therefore will represent \\nthe amounts or income or expenditure pertaining to the period. These should \\nbe transferred to the Income and Expenditure Account. iii.Post from the debit of the Receipts & Payments Account to the credit of the \\nIncome and Expenditure Account other items of income wherein accruals \\nand outstanding amount have to be adjusted. Likewise, post item of expenses \\nin which no adjustment is to be made directly to debit of income and \\nExpenditure Account. iv. Transfer the balance of Income and Expenditure Account to the \\nAccumulated Fund/Capital Fund Account. v. Post the receipts and payments of capital nature from the Receipts and \\nPayments Account to the appropriate asset or liability account for \\nincorporating in the Balance Sheet. If a part or whole of an asset has been \\nsold, the capital profit/loss, if any, is credited / debited in the Income and \\nExpenditure Account. The balance of Income and Expenditure Account \\nshould be transferred to the Accumulated Fund/Capital Fund Account.'), Document(page_content='vi. Prepare a Balance Sheet by including therein all the balances left over after \\ntransfers to the Income and Expenditure Account have been made. 4. BALANCE SHEET \\nA Balance Sheet is the statement of assets and liabilities of an accounting unit at a \\ngiven date. It is generally prepared at the end of an accounting period after the \\nIncome and Expenditure Account has been prepared.'), Document(page_content='It is classified summary of \\nthe ledger balances left over, after accounts of all the revenue items have been \\nclosed by transfer to the Income and Expenditure Account. In not for profit \\norganizations, the excess of total assets over total outside liabilities is known as \\nCapital Fund. The Capital fund represents the amount contributed by members, \\nthrough legacies, special donations, entrance fees and accumulated surplus over \\nthe years. If however, members have not contributed any amount, it shall be \\ntermed as \"Accumulated fund\" instead of \"Capital fund\". The surplus or deficit, if \\nany, on the year\\'s working as disclosed by the Income and Expenditure Account is \\nshown either as an addition to or deduction from the Capital / Accumulated Fund \\nbrought forward from the previous period respectively. 4.1.Accounting Treatment of Some Special Items \\n4.1.1 Donations: These may have been raised either for meeting some revenue or \\ncapital expenditure; those intended for the first mentioned purpose are credited \\ndirectly to the Income and Expenditure Account but others, if the donors have \\ndeclared their specific intention, then they are credited to special fund account \\nand in the absence thereof, to the Capital Fund Account. If any investments are \\npurchased out of a special fund or an asset is acquired therefrom, these are \\ndisclosed separately. Any income received from such investments or any \\ndonations collected for a special purpose are credited to an account indicating the \\npurpose and correspondingly the expenditure incurred in carrying out the \\npurpose of the fund is debited to this account. On no account any such expense is \\ncharged to the Income and Expenditure Account. The term \"Fund\" is strictly \\napplicable to the amounts collected for a special purpose when these \\nare invested, e.g. Scholarship Fund, Prize Fund etc. In other cases, when \\nthe amounts collected are not invested in securities or assets distinguishable from \\nthose belonging to the institution, the word \"Account\" is more appropriate e.g. Building_Account, Tournament Account etc. Instead of paying cash, a donor may sometimes give away or transfer a security or \\nsome other readily realisable asset. In such a case, the value of asset on valuation, \\nmust be credited to the fund for which the amount has been donated. 4.1.2 Entrance and Admission Fees: Such fees which are payable by a \\nmember on admission to club or society are normally considered capital receipts \\nand credited to Capital Fund. This is because these do not give rise to any special \\nobligation towards the member who is entitled to the same privileges as others \\nwho have paid only their annual subscription. Nevertheless, where the amount is \\nsmall, meant to cover expenses concerning admission, or the rules of the society \\nprovided that such fees could be treated as income of the society, these amounts \\nmay be included in the Income and Expenditure Account. The treatment depends \\nupon the requirement of question.'), Document(page_content='If the question is silent then always take it to \\nbe capital receipt. 4.1.3 Subscription: Subscriptions being an income should be allocated over \\nthe period of their accrual. For testing the knowledge of candidates of this \\nimportant accounting principle, questions are often set in examinations wherein \\nfigures of subscription collected by a society during the year as well as those \\noutstanding at the beginning of the year and at its close are given. If some \\nsubscriptions have been received in advance, their amount is also indicated. In \\nsuch cases, it is always desirable to set up a Subscription Account for determining \\nthe amount of subscription pertaining for the period for which accounts are being \\nprepared. For example, if it is stated that subscriptions collected by a society \\nduring the year 2022 amounted to ₹ 1,850 out of which ₹ 200 represented \\nsubscription for the year 2021 ; ₹ 100 were subscriptions collected in advance for \\nthe year 2023, and subscriptions amounting to ₹ 500 were outstanding for \\nrecovery at the end of 2022, the adjusting journal entries and the Subscription \\nAccount should be set up as follows: \\nSubscription Outstanding Account: \\nTo Subscriptions Account Dr. ₹500 (The amount outstanding for this year \\ncredited to Subscription Account) \\nSubscription A/c: \\nTo Outstanding Subscription A/c Dr. ₹300 \\nTo Subscriptions Received in Advance A/c ₹200 (Subscription received ₹200 for \\nthe previous year and ₹100 for the next year, adjusted) \\nSubscription Account: \\n2022 Dr. Jan 1 To Balance b/d (Outstanding Subscriptions) ₹200 \\nDec. 31 To Subscriptions received in advance ₹100 \\nTo Income and Expenditure Account ₹2,050 \\nTotal ₹2,350 \\n2022 Cr. Dec. By Cash A/c ₹1,850 \\nBy Balance c/d (Subscriptions Outstanding) ₹500 \\nTotal ₹2,350 \\nThe amount of outstanding subscription is adjusted in the Subscription Account \\nby debit to Outstanding Subscription Account and that balance is shown as an \\nasset in Balance Sheet. The Subscription Account is closed off by transferring its \\nbalance at the end of the year to the Income and Expenditure Account. 4.1.4 Life Membership Fee: Fees received for life membership is a capital \\nreceipt as it is of non-recurring nature. It is directly added to capital fund or \\ngeneral fund. For adjusting lump sum subscription collected from the life members, one of the \\nfollowing methods can be adopted: \\n1) The entire amount may be carried forward in a special account until the \\nmember dies, after which the same may be transferred to the credit of the \\nAccumulated Fund. 2) An amount equal to the normal annual subscription may be transferred \\nevery year to the Income and Expenditure Account and balance carried \\nforward till it is exhausted. If, however, the life member dies before the whole \\nof the amount paid by him has been transferred in this way, the balance \\nshould be transferred to the Accumulated Fund on the date of his death. 3) An amount, calculated according to the age and average life of the \\nmember, may annually be transferred to the credit of Income and \\nExpenditure Account. Other concepts \\nTreatment of Important Items in Not For Profit Organization \\n1. Donation: it is gift in cash or kind from some person.'), Document(page_content='It may be of two \\ntypes: \\na. Specific Donation: It is received for certain specific purpose like \\nBuilding Donation,   Library Books donation etc. It should be \\ncapitalized and shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. b.

Treatment of Sale of Old Newspaper and Periodicals: The amount received \\non such sale is shown as Income on the credit side of income and \\nexpenditure account. 7. Sale of old Fixed Assets: The Sale proceeds of old Fixed Assets are treated \\nas capital receipts. The profit or loss on sale of fixed asset is shown in the \\nIncome and Expenditure \\n \\n8. Honorarium: It is paid to someone for receiving any services from person \\nwho are not the employees of the Not for Profit Organisation. 4.2.Preparation of Balance Sheet \\nA /c\\n•\\nPreparation of opening balance sheet and calculation of \\nsurplus: If capital fund or accumulated surplus in the beginning of the \\nyear is not given, it is calculated by deducting liabilities from assets in the \\nbeginning of year. While calculating opening capital fund, care should be \\ntaken to include prepaid expenses and accrued incomes as assets and \\noutstanding expenses and advance incomes as liabilities. Any surplus \\nearned during the year is added to the opening capital fund and deficit \\nsuffered during the year is deducted from the opening capital fund. •\\nCash and bank balance: Closing cash and bank balance as disclosed in \\nReceipt and Payment Account is shown in the assets side of Balance Sheet. If there is a bank overdraft, it is to be shown on the liabilities side of the \\nbalance sheet. •\\nFixed assets: Opening balances of Fixed Assets (Furniture, building, \\nequipment, etc.) are increased by the amount of purchases and reduced by \\nsales of the same and depreciation on the same. •\\nLiabilities: Opening balances of liabilities should be adjusted for any \\nincrease or decrease in the same.

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS \\nRegistration \\nThe educational institutions which are functioning in India are mostly registered \\nas Societies under the Indian Societies Registration Act of 1860, in some of the \\nStates, where Public Trust Acts have been passed all the Societies registered \\nunder the Indian Societies Registration Act, 1860 are required to be \\nsimultaneously registered under the Trust Act. Accordingly, in the State of \\nMaharashtra, all the Societies have simultaneously been registered under the \\nBombay Public Trust Act, 1950. Organizational Pattern \\nThe Trust Societies are autonomous bodies with office bearers consisting of \\nPresident, Secretary, Treasurer and Executive Committee Members. The General \\nBody consists of all the Members of the Society. In case of Societies/Trusts which \\nrun a number of colleges and schools etc., for managing the affairs of each \\nindividual school or college, there is a governing body, wherein the head of the \\nUnit, such as Principal of the college or Head Master of the school as, the case \\nmay be, are also members of the Governing Body. The function of the Governing Body is to supervise the smooth functioning of the \\nindividual school or college. Salient Features \\nThe basic tenets pre-suppose, that part of the expenses of the educational \\ninstitutions are met from the funds raised by the educational institutions \\nthemselves, either from donations, or from charities, collected from benevolent \\ncitizens in the country. The State Governments through grant-in-aid-code have evolved different \\npatterns of giving assistance to the educational institutions. There is, as such, no \\nuniformity in the giving of assistance to the educational institutions in the form \\nof grants. All the educational institutions follow financial year as their accounting year. 5.1 Sources of Finance for Running the Educational Institution \\nThere are three main sources through which amounts are collected by the \\neducational institutions. These are: \\n1) Donation from Public; \\n2) Fees in the form of annual tuition fees, term fees, admission fees, \\nlaboratory fee etc., and \\n3) Grants received from the Government. The Government grants are of four kinds namely Maintenance Grant, Equipment \\ngrant, Building Grant and such other grants as may be sanctioned by the \\nGovernment from time to time. 5.2 Specific items \\n5.2.1 Donation from Public \\nThese are received either for recurring or non-recurring purposes.'), Document(page_content=\"Donations are \\nreceived either in cash or in kind. The 'in kind' donations are in the form of land \\nand building, shares and securities, utensils, furniture and fixtures and the like, \\ngenerally with a desire to perpetuate the memory of a distinguished member of \\nthe family of the donor. 5.2.2 Capitation fees or admission fees \\nAmounts are collected from parents/guardians of the students who seek \\nadmission in the educational institution. These are either in the form of \\ncapitation fees or admission fees and are generally collected by the Parent Body \\nwhich runs the institution. In recent times, such collections have been a matter of \\nsevere attack and ban. 5.2.3 Laboratory and Library deposit \\nThese are generally collected by schools and colleges and they remain with the \\ninstitution till the student finally leaves it. The School Code prescribes the rates of tuition and other fees, to be charged from \\nthe students. 5.2.4 Use of Term Fees \\nA separate account of receipts and expenditures shall be maintained and surplus \\ncarried over to the next year.

CHAPTER 9 \\nACCOUNTS FROM INCOMPLETE RECORDS \\n1. INTRODUCTION \\nVery often small sole proprietorship and partnership businesses do not maintain \\ndouble entry book keeping. There might be reasons like lack of knowledge of \\naccounting, or the business is small and they do not wish to spend time or effort \\nin maintaining the accounting records. As such, they might keep a record of the \\ncash transactions and credit transactions only. But at the end of the accounting \\nperiod, they will want to know the performance and financial position of their \\nbusinesses. Think of a grocery-vendor who sells vegetables on a street or runs a \\nsmall shop. Is he expected to learn accounting formally? No, he is only looking at \\nkeeping a record of a few items including: \\n•\\nWhat amount is he supposed to pay for items purchased on credit from his \\nsupplier? •\\nWhat cash has he collected by selling those vegetables?'), Document(page_content='•\\nIn case he runs a shop, how much amount has he paid for rent or \\nelectricity expenses?'), Document(page_content='•\\nIn case he sells some items on credit, how much is he supposed to receive \\nfrom that customer? There might be other reasons for incomplete records such as: \\n•\\n Accounting records are destroyed by accident, such as fire; \\n•\\nSome essential figure is unknown and must be calculated as a balancing \\nfigure (for example, due to inventory being damaged or destroyed). Every person would like to know the profit generated by the business. What we \\nexpect to learn is how to use those records to arrive at the profit or loss earned by \\nthe business or understand the financial position of that business. This chapter discusses how to complete the accounts from available incomplete \\nrecords and addresses the problems faced in a single-entry system. There is no such formal system as Single-Entry System as the accounts can only \\nbe prepared using Double Entry System. It might be appropriate to mention that \\na single-entry system is truly a system of incomplete or improper records. The way \"Single Entry System\" operates is that for some transactions the book-\\nkeepers complete entries and for some others they complete just one aspect of the \\ntransaction.'), Document(page_content='In fact, for some other transactions, they even do not pass any entry. The task of the accountant is to establish link among the available information \\nand to finalize these accounts. Normally, the businessmen keep a record of cash receipts and cash payments and \\npersonal accounts (receivables, payables, capital etc.) Also, information from \\nbank statement (withdrawals, deposits) is easily available as well. Features of Single Entry System \\n•\\nIt is an inaccurate, unscientific and unsystematic method of recording \\nbusiness transactions. •\\nThere is generally no record of real and nominal accounts and, in most of \\nthe cases; a record is kept for cash transactions and personal accounts.'), Document(page_content='•\\nCash book mixes up business and personal transactions of the owners. •\\n There is no uniformity in maintaining the records and the system may \\ndiffer from firm to firm depending on the requirements and convenience \\nof each firm. •\\n Profit under this system is only an estimate based on available \\ninformation and therefore true and correct profits cannot be determined. The same is the case with the financial position in the absence of a proper \\nbalance sheet.'), Document(page_content='2. TYPES OF SINGLE ENTRY SYSTEM \\nA scrutiny of many procedures adopted in maintaining records under single entry \\nsystem brings forth the existence of following three types: \\ni. Pure single entry: In this, only personal accounts are maintained with \\nthe result that no information is available in respect of cash and bank \\nbalances, sales and purchases, etc.'), Document(page_content='In view of its failure to provide even the \\nbasic information regarding cash etc., this method exists only on paper and \\nhas no practical application. ii. Simple single entry: In this, only: (a) personal accounts, and (b) cash \\nbook are maintained. Although these accounts are kept on the basis of double \\nentry system, postings from cash book are made only to personal accounts \\nwith no other account to be found in the ledger. Cash received from debtors \\nor cash paid to creditors is simply noted on the bills issued or received as the \\ncase may be. ACCOUNTS FROM INCOMPLETE RECORDS \\nFor example, M/s Small shop runs a retail shop. It keeps a register of amount \\nreceivable from people for items sold (bread, butter, milk etc).'), Document(page_content='as under: \\nMr.'), Document(page_content='A - ₹ 300 \\nMr. B - ₹ 450 \\nMr. C - ₹ 260. The business does not maintain a record of what item has been sold.'), Document(page_content='It is only \\nconcerned about the amount receivable (personal account balance) from its \\ncustomers. Quasi single entry: In this: (a) personal accounts, (b) cash book, and (c) some \\nsubsidiary books are maintained. The main subsidiary books kept under this \\nsystem are Sales book, Purchases book and Bills book. No separate record is \\nmaintained for discounts, which are entered into the personal accounts. In \\naddition, some scattered information is also available in respect of few important \\nitems of expenses like wages, rent, rates, etc. In fact, this is the method which is \\ngenerally adopted as a substitute for double entry system. Some businesses may also maintain additional records like Bills book or Sales \\nbook. This might be required for tax or other purposes. For example, a shop \\nselling -shirts may want to issue a bill to each customer for the sales made to \\nthem. This will help them validate any returns of goods within reasonable time. In addition, they may keep a purchase book to record all purchases.'), Document(page_content='Also, organisations employing workers keep records of cash wages paid and take \\nacceptance from the workers for the amount paid to them. Types of Single Entry System \\nt\\nIn accounting, the single entry system is a method where only one entry is made \\nfor each transaction, and it is categorized into different types based on the \\nrecords maintained: \\n1. Pure Single Entry: In this most basic form, only personal accounts are \\nmaintained. It involves recording the transaction involving individuals and \\nentities, excluding the records of assets, liabilities, incomes, and expenses. 2. Simple Single Entry: This system is a step above the pure single entry \\nsystem, where personal accounts and a cash book are maintained. The cash \\nbook records all cash transactions, providing some information about cash \\nflows, in addition to the records of individuals and businesses the entity deals \\nwith. 3. Quasi Single Entry: This system is a hybrid approach that includes the \\nmaintenance of personal accounts, a cash book, and subsidiary books. Subsidiary books may include records such as purchases and sales books, \\nwhich allows for a more comprehensive tracking of transactions than the \\npure or simple single entry systems. Each type of single entry system serves a different level of accounting needs, with \\nincreasing complexity and detail in the records maintained.'), Document(page_content=\"3. ASCERTAINMENT OF PROFIT BY CAPITAL COMPARISON \\nThis method is also known as Net Worth method or Statement of Affairs \\nMethod. Net Worth Method or Statement of Affairs Method \\nThe Net Worth method, also known as the Statement of Affairs Method, is a \\ntechnique used to estimate the profit or loss of a business over a certain period of \\ntime. This approach is particularly useful in single-entry accounting systems \\nwhere a full double-entry bookkeeping record is not available. The formula to \\ncalculate profit or loss is: \\nProfit/(Loss) = Closing Capital - Opening Capital \\nWhere: \\nClosing Capital refers to the net worth of the business at the end of the \\naccounting period, as determined by the Statement of Affairs. It is the total assets \\nminus total liabilities at the period's end. Opening Capital is the net worth of the business at the beginning of the \\naccounting period, also determined by the Statement of Affairs, which is the total \\nassets minus total liabilities at the period's start. The difference between the closing capital and the opening capital represents the \\nnet increase or decrease in the owner's equity, which, after adjusting for any \\ndrawings and additional capital introduced during the period, gives the profit or \\nloss. If detailed information regarding revenue and expenses is not known, it becomes \\ndifficult to prepare profit and loss account. Instead by collecting information \\nabout assets and liabilities, it is easier to prepare balance sheet at two different \\npoints of time. So, while preparing accounts from incomplete records, if sufficient \\ninformation is not available, it is better to follow the method of capital \\ncomparison to arrive at the profit/loss for the current year. 3.1 Methods of Capital Comparison \\nClosing capital increases if there is profit, while it reduces if there is loss incurred \\nduring the year. However, if the proprietor/partners make fresh investments in \\nthe business, capital increases; and any withdrawal made by them, decreases the \\ncapital. The following points shall be considered while computing the profit/loss under \\ncapital comparison method- \\nParticulars\\t\\n \\nCapital at the end (a)\\t\\n \\nAdd: Drawings\\t\\n \\nLess: Fresh capital introduced\\t\\n \\nCapital at the beginning (b)\\t\\n \\nProfit (a-b)\\t\\n \\n3.2 Difference between Statement of Affairs and Balance Sheet \\nBasis of Comparison: \\n1.Source: \\nStatement of Affairs: It is prepared on the basis of partially recorded transactions \\nunder the double entry system and estimates under the single entry system, with \\nmuch of the information gathered from memory rather than complete records. Balance Sheet: It is strictly based on double-entry bookkeeping with each item \\nverifiable from subsidiary books, ledger accounts, and documentary evidence. 2.Capital: \\nStatement of Affairs: Here, capital is merely a balancing figure, reflecting the \\nexcess of assets over liabilities. Balance Sheet: Capital is derived from the capital account in the ledger, ensuring \\nassets are equal to liabilities. 3.Omission: \\nStatement of Affairs: Incomplete records make it difficult to identify and record \\nall assets and liabilities, leading to potential omissions. Balance Sheet: There is no possibility of omission as all assets and liabilities are \\nproperly recorded, and the balance must agree. 4.Basis of Valuation: \\nStatement of Affairs: Valuation is often arbitrary and not based on a systematic \\nmethod, and the method of valuation is not usually disclosed. Balance Sheet: Assets are valued on a scientific basis, and any changes in \\nvaluation method are clearly disclosed. 5.Objective: \\nStatement of Affairs: The objective is to identify the commencement of trading, \\nby preparing a statement that figures the beginning and end capital accounts in \\nthe respective accounting periods. Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is prepared to ascertain the financial position \\non a particular date, ensuring accurate and timely financial reporting. 3.3 Preparation of Statement of Affairs and Determination of Profit \\nIt has been discussed in Para 3.1 that figures of assets and liabilities should be \\ncollected for preparation of statement of affairs. Given below an example: \\n4.\"), Document(page_content=\"TECHNIQUES OF OBTAINING COMPLETE ACCOUNTING \\nINFORMATION \\nWhen books of accounts are incomplete, it is essential to complete double entry \\nin respect of all transactions. The whole accounting process should be carefully \\nfollowed and Trial Balance should be drawn up. 4.1 General Techniques \\nWhere the accounts of a business are incomplete, it is advisable to convert them \\nfirst to the double entry system and then to draw up the Profit and Loss Account \\nand the Balance Sheet, instead of determining the amount of profit/loss by \\npreparing the statement of affairs. As books of accounts of different firms being \\nincomplete in varying degrees, it is not possible to suggest a formula which could \\nuniformly be applied for preparing final accounts therefrom. As a general rule, it \\nis essential to first start the ledger accounts with the opening balances of assets, \\nliabilities and the capital. Afterwards, each book of original entry should be \\nseparately dealt with, so as to complete the double entry by posting into the \\nledger all entries which have not been posted. For example, If only personal \\naccounts have been posted from the Cash Book, debits and credits pertaining to \\nnominal accounts and real accounts that are not posted, should be posted into the \\nledger. If there are Discount Columns in the Cash Book, the totals of discounts \\npaid and received should be posted to Discounts Allowed and Discounts Received \\nAccounts respectively, for completing the double entry. Afterwards, the other subsidiary books, i.e., Purchases Day Book, Sales Day Book, \\nPurchase Return Book, Sales Return Book, Bills Receivable and Bills Payable, etc. should be totaled up and their totals posted into the ledger to the debit or credit \\nof the appropriate nominal or real accounts, as the personal aspect of the \\ntransactions have been posted already. When an Accountant is engaged in posting the unposted items from the Cash \\nBook and other subsidiary books, he may be confronted with a number of \\nproblems. The manner in which some of them may be dealt with is described \\nbelow: \\n1) In the Cash Book, there can be several receipt entries which have no \\nconnection with the business but which belong to the proprietor, e.g., interest \\ncollected on his private investment, legacies received by him, amount \\ncontributed by the proprietor from his private resources, etc. All those \\namounts should be credited to his capital account. Also the Cash Book may \\ncontain entries in respect of payments for proprietor's purchases and his \\npersonal expenses. All such items should be taken to his capital account on \\nthe debit side as drawings. 2) Amounts belonging to the business after collection may have been directly \\nutilised for acquiring business assets or for meeting certain expenses instead \\nof being recorded in the Cash Book. On the other hand, the proprietor may \\nhave met some of the business expenses from his private resources. In that \\ncase, the appropriate asset or expense account should be debited and the \\nsource of obtaining funds to be credited. 3) If cash is short, because the proprietor had withdrawn amount without any \\nentry having been made in the cash book the proprietor’s capital account \\nshould be debited. In fact, it will be necessary to credit or debit the \\nproprietor’s capital amount which cannot be adjusted anywhere else. 4) Where the benefit of an item of an expense is received both by the \\nproprietor and business, then it should be allocated between the two on some \\nequitable basis e.g. rent of premises when the proprietor lives in the same \\npremises, should be allocated on the basis of the area occupied by him for \\nresidence. In the end, it will be possible to draw a Trial Balance.\"), Document(page_content='Students are advised to \\nprepare a Trial balance as it will bring out any mistakes committed while making \\nthe above adjustments. 4.2 Derivation of Information from Cash Book \\nThe analysis of cash as well as bank receipts and payments, should be extensive \\nbut under significant heads, so that various items of income and expenditure can \\nbe posted therefrom into the ledger. However before posting the information into \\nthe ledger the same should be collected in the form of an account, the specimen \\nwhereof is shown below: \\nCash and Bank Summary Account for the year ended (assumed figures) \\nCash and Bank Summary Account for the year ended (assumed figures): \\nTo Balance in hand: Cash ₹590, Bank ₹7,400 \\nBy Expenses: Cash ₹3,000 \\nAccounting 9.16: \\nTo Sales: ₹6,500 \\nTo Collection from Debtors: ₹10,000 \\nBy Purchases: Cash ₹100, Bank ₹6,000 \\nBy Sundry creditors: Bank ₹5,000 \\nBy Drawings: Cash ₹1,500 \\nBy Petty expenses: Cash ₹800 \\nBy Rent: Bank ₹1,000 \\nBy Electricity and water: Bank ₹350 \\nBy Repairs: Bank ₹350 \\nBy Wages: Bank ₹1,000 \\nBy Balance in Hand: Cash ₹990, Bank ₹4,400 \\nThe important point about incomplete records is that much of the information \\nmay not be readily available and that the relevant information has to be \\nascertained. A good point is to prepare Cash and Bank Summary (if not available \\nin proper form with both sides tallied). The cash and bank balance at the end \\nshould be reconciled with the cash and bank books. Having done so, the various \\nitems detailed on the Summary Statements, should be posted into the ledger.'), Document(page_content='It is quite likely that some of the missing information will then be available.'), Document(page_content='Consider the following about a firm relating to \\n March 2022.'), Document(page_content='Cash and Bank Summary: \\n31st\\xa0\\nDr. Cash Balance on 1-4-2021: ₹250 \\nCollection from Sundry debtors: ₹45,600 \\nSale of old furniture: ₹750 \\nFresh Capital brought in: ₹5,000 \\nBalancing figure- (Cash sales): ₹8,340 \\nCash Balance on 31-03-2022: ₹310 \\nCr.

Analysis of Sales Ledger of the year: \\n➢Opening Customer Balance \\n➢Sales \\n➢Bills Dishonored \\n➢Total Debits \\n➢Cash Received \\n➢Discounts Allowed \\n➢Bills Received \\n➢Sales Returns \\n➢Bad Debts \\n➢Total Credit \\n➢Balance (closing) \\nFrom the aforementioned, it will be possible to build up information about sales \\nand other accounts which can then be posted in totals, if so desired. It would also \\nbe possible to prepare Total Debtors \\nAccount in the following form: \\nProforma of Total Debtors Account (assumed figures) \\nTo Opening balance: ₹5,000 \\nTo Sales: ₹38,000 \\nTo Bills dishonoured: ₹280 \\nTo Interest: ₹100 \\nTotal: ₹43,380 \\nBy Cash/Bank: ₹10,000 \\nBy Discount: ₹500 \\nBy Bills receivable: ₹20,000 \\nBy Bad debts: ₹280 \\nBy Closing balance: ₹12,600 \\nTotal: ₹43,380 \\nIn can be seen from the above format that, if any one figure is not given it can be \\nfound out easily as the balancing figure. It can be opening balance, credit sales, \\ncash collected or closing balance etc.'), Document(page_content='For instance, if the information about sales \\nis not available it could be ascertained as the balancing figure, i.e., in the total \\nDebtors Account given above, if all other figures are given, amount of sales on \\ncredit basis can be easily ascertained. 4.4 Distinction between Business Expenses and Drawings \\nIt has been already stated that often the distinction is not made between business \\nexpenses and drawings. While completing accounts from incomplete records, it is \\nnecessary to scan the business transactions carefully to identify the existence of \\ndrawings. The main items of drawings are (illustrative): \\n•\\n Rent of premises commonly used for residential as well as business \\npurposes. •\\nCommon electricity and telephone bills.'), Document(page_content='•\\nLife insurance premiums of proprietor/partners paid from business cash. •\\nHousehold expenses met from business cash. •\\n Private loan paid to friends and relatives out of business cash. •\\n Personal gifts made to any friends and relatives out of business cash. •\\nGoods or services taken from the business for personal consumption. •\\nCash withdrawals to meet family expenses.'), Document(page_content=\"•\\nAmount collected from debtors directly used for meeting personal \\nexpenses. So it is necessary to scan the summary of cash transactions, business resources \\nand their utilization to assess the nature of drawings and its amount. 4.5 Fresh Investment by proprietors / partners \\nLike drawings, often fresh investments made by proprietors'/partners are not \\nreadily identifiable. It becomes necessary to scan the business transactions \\ncarefully. Apart from direct cash investment, fresh investments may take the \\nfollowing shape: \\n•\\nMoney collected and put in the business on maturity of Life Insurance \\nPolicy of the proprietors. •\\nInterest and dividend of personal investment of the proprietors collected \\nand put in the business.\"), Document(page_content='•\\nIncome from non-business property collected and put in the business. •\\n Payments made to creditors out of personal cash. Unless these items are \\nproperly identified and segregated, business income will be affected and \\nproper statement of affairs cannot be prepared. CHAPTER 10 \\nPARTNERSHIP AND LLP ACCOUNTS \\nUNIT - 1 INTRODUCTION TO PARTNERSHIP ACCOUNTS \\n1.INTRODUCTION: WHY PARTNERSHIP? An individual, i.e., a sole proprietor may not be in a position to cope with the \\nfinancial and managerial demands of the present-day business world. As a result, \\ntwo or more individuals may decide to pool their financial and non-financial \\nresources to carry on a business. The preparation of final accounts of sole \\nproprietors have already been discussed in chapter 6 . The final accounts of \\npartnership firms including basic concepts of accounting for admission of a \\npartner, retirement and death of a partner have been discussed in succeeding \\nunits of this chapter. 2.DEFINITION AND FEATURES OF PARTNERSHIP \\nAs per Section 4 of the Partnership Act, 1932: \\n\"Partnership is the relation between persons who have agreed to \\nshare the profit of a business carried on by all or any of them acting \\nfor all.\" \\nFeatures of a partnership, \\ni. Existence of an agreement: As per section 5 of the Indian Partnership \\nAct, 1932, The relation of partnership arises from contract between parties \\nand not from status as it happens in case of HUF (Hindu Undivided Family). A formal or written agreement is not necessary to create a partnership.'), Document(page_content='ii. Business: A partnership can exist only in business. Thus, it is not the \\nagreement alone which creates a partnership. A partnership comes into \\nexistence only when partners begin to carry on business in accordance with \\ntheir agreement. Section 2 (b) of Indian Partnership Act, 1932 only \\nstates that business includes every trade, occupation and \\nprofession. iii.Sharing of profit: The persons concerned must agree to share the \\nprofits of the business. Because no person is a partner unless he or she \\nhas the right to share the profits of the business. Section 4 of Indian \\nPartnership Act, 1932 does not insist upon sharing of losses. Thus, a \\nprovision for sharing of loss is not necessary.'), Document(page_content='iv. Mutual agency: It means that the business is to be carried on by all or \\nany of them acting for all. Thus, if the person carrying on the business acts \\nnot only for himself but for others also so that they stand in the positions of \\nprincipals and agents, they are partners.'), Document(page_content='v. Minor as a partner: A minor can be added in partnership firm. But the \\ncondition is that he can be admitted to share profit only.'), Document(page_content=\"He cannot be made \\nto share losses of the firm. If the partnership firm suffers loss than it will be \\nborne by other major partners is their profit-sharing ratio. Number of Partners: Minimum Partners: Two \\nMaximum Partners: As per Section 464 of the Companies Act, 2013, no \\nassociation or partnership consisting of more than 100 number of persons as may \\nbe prescribed shall be formed for the purpose of carrying on any business. Rule \\n10 of Companies (incorporation) Rules 2014 specifies the limit as 50. Thus, \\nmaximum number of members in a partnership firm are 50. 3.LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP \\nThe Indian Partnership Act of 1932 provides for a general form of partnership \\nwhich has inherent shortcoming of unlimited liability of all partners for business \\ndebts and legal consequences, regardless of their holding or profit-sharing ratio, \\nas the firm is not a legal entity. General partners are also jointly and severally \\nliable for tortuous acts of co-partners. In case of liquidation personal assets of \\npartners can be liquidated to meet liabilities of the firm. With the growth of the Indian economy, the role played by its entrepreneurs as \\nwell as its technical and professional manpower has been acknowledged \\ninternationally. Entrepreneurship, knowledge, risk and capital may be combined \\nto provide a further impetus to India's economic growth. In this background, a \\nneed has been felt for a new corporate form that would provide an alternative to \\nthe traditional partnership, with unlimited personal liability on the one hand, \\nand, the statute-based governance structure of the limited liability company on \\nthe other. This would enable professional expertise and entrepreneurial initiative \\nto combine, organize and operate in flexible, innovative and efficient manner. The Government felt that with Indian professionals increasingly transacting with \\nor representing multi-nationals in international transactions, the extent of the \\nliability they could potentially be exposed to, is extremely high. Hence, in order to \\nencourage Indian professionals to participate in the international business \\ncommunity without apprehension of being subject to excessive liability, the need \\nfor having a legal structure like the LLP is encouraged. Thus, in convergence \\ntowards global scenario, Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 was introduced. The Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is viewed as an alternative corporate \\nbusiness proposal that provides the benefits of limited liability but allows its \\nmembers, the flexibility of organizing their internal structure as a partnership, \\nwhich is based on a mutually arrived agreement. The LLP will be a separate legal entity, liable to the full extent of its assets, with \\nthe liability of the partners being limited to their agreed contribution in the LLP \\nwhich may be of tangible or intangible nature or both tangible and intangible in \\nnature. No partner would be liable on account of the independent or un-\\nauthorized actions of other partners or their misconduct. The liabilities of the \\nLLP and partners who are found to have acted with intent to defraud Creditors or \\nfor any fraudulent purpose shall be unlimited for all or any of the debts or other \\nliabilities of the LLP. The main benefit in an LLP is that it is taxed as a partnership, but has the \\nbenefits of being a corporate, or more significantly, a juristic entity with limited \\nliability. An LLP has the special characteristic of being a separate legal \\npersonality distinct from its partners. The LLP is a body corporate in nature. Summary of key advantages and challenges associated with formation \\nof LLP could be presented as below: \\nAdvantages: \\ni. LLP is organized and operates on the basis of an agreement.\"), Document(page_content='ii.'), Document(page_content='Enables professional/technical expertise and initiative to combine with \\nfinancial risk taking capacity in an innovative and efficient manner. iii.Limited liability of partners as in case of corporate entities along with \\nflexibility of a partnership without imposing detailed legal and procedural \\nrequirements; \\niv. Lower registration costs as compared to corporate entities; \\nv. Audit not mandatory (subject to turnover / capital contribution \\nbenchmark) \\nChallenges: \\ni.'), Document(page_content='Public disclosure of financial statements; \\nii. No option for Equity investments; \\niii.Extensive penal provisions for non-compliance \\nThe Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) in India were introduced by Limited \\nLiability Partnership Act, 2008 which lay down the law for the formation and \\nregulation of Limited Liability Partnerships. Later, the Ministry of Law and \\nJustice made amendments to the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 (LLP \\nAct) through the LLP (Amendment) Act, 2021. 1.3.1 Definition of LLP \\nSection 2 of the Limited Liability Partnership (LLPs) Act, 2008 defines limited \\nliability partnership\" as a partnership formed and registered under this Act; \\nand \"limited liability partnership agreement\" means any written agreement \\nbetween the partners of the limited liability partnership or between the limited \\nliability partnership and its partners which determines the mutual rights and \\nduties of the partners and their rights and duties in relation to that limited \\nliability partnership. \"Small limited liability partnership\" means a limited liability partnership— \\ni. the contribution of which, does not exceed twenty-five lakh rupees or such \\nhigher amount, not exceeding five crore rupees, as may be prescribed; and \\nii. the turnover of which, as per the Statement of Accounts and Solvency for \\nthe immediately preceding financial year, does not exceed forty lakh rupees \\nor such higher amount, not exceeding fifty crore rupees, as may be \\nprescribed; or \\n1.3.2 Nature of Limited Liability Partnership \\n1) A limited liability partnership is a body corporate formed and \\nincorporated under this Act and is a legal entity separate from that of its \\npartners. 2) A limited liability partnership should have perpetual succession.'), Document(page_content='3) Any change in the partners of a limited liability partnership should not \\naffect the existence, rights, or liabilities of the limited liability partnership. 1.3.3 Non-applicability of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 \\nSave as otherwise provided, the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 \\nshall not apply to a limited liability partnership. 1.3.4 Minimum number of partners in case of LLP \\nAs per the LLP Act, any individual or body corporate may be a partner in a \\nlimited liability partnership; provided that an individual shall not be capable of \\nbecoming a partner of a limited liability partnership, if- \\na) he has been found to be of unsound mind by a Court of competent \\njurisdiction and the finding is in force; \\nb) he is an undischarged insolvent; or \\nc) he has applied to be adjudicated as an insolvent and his application is \\npending. Every limited liability partnership shall have at least two partners. If at any time the number of partners of a limited liability partnership is reduced \\nbelow two and the limited liability partnership carries on business for more than \\nsix months while the number is so reduced, the person, who is the only partner of \\nthe limited liability partnership during the time that it so carries on business after \\nthose six months and has the knowledge \\nof the fact that it is carrying on business with him alone, shall be liable personally \\nfor the obligations of the limited liability partnership incurred during that period. 1.3.5 Designated partners \\nAs per Section 7 of the LLP Act, every limited liability partnership should have at \\nleast two designated partners who are individuals and at least one of them should \\nbe a resident in India: \\nProvided that in case of a limited liability partnership in which all the partners \\nare bodies corporate or in which one or more partners are individuals and bodies \\ncorporate, at least two individuals who are partners of such limited liability \\npartnership or nominees of such body corporate will act as designated partners. Explanation. -For the purposes of this section, the term \"resident in India\" means \\na person who has stayed in India for a period of not less than \\n days during \\nthe immediately preceding one year. Subject to the provisions of the Act, \\n1) if the incorporation document- \\na) specifies who are to be designated partners, such persons should be \\ndesignated partners on incorporation; or \\nb) states that each of the partners from time to time of limited liability \\npartnership is to be designated partner, every such partner will be a \\ndesignated partner; \\n2) any partner may become a designated partner by and in accordance with \\nthe limited liability partnership agreement and a partner may cease to be a \\ndesignated partner in accordance with limited liability partnership \\nagreement. 3) An individual will not become a designated partner in any limited liability \\npartnership unless he has given his prior consent to act as such to the limited \\nliability partnership in such form and manner as may be prescribed. 4) Every limited liability partnership should file with the registrar the \\nparticulars of every individual who has given his consent to act as a \\ndesignated partner in such form and manner as may be prescribed within \\nthirty days of his appointment. 5) An individual eligible to be a designated partner should satisfy such \\nconditions and requirements as may be prescribed. 1.3.6 Liabilities of designated partners \\nAs per LLP Act, unless expressly provided otherwise in this Act, a designated \\npartner should be- \\n1201\\na) responsible for the doing of all acts, matters, and things as are required to \\nbe done by the limited liability partnership in respect of compliance of the \\nprovisions of this Act including filing of any document, return, statement, \\nand the like report pursuant to the provisions of this Act and as may be \\nspecified in the limited liability partnership agreement; and. b) liable to all penalties imposed on the limited liability partnership for any \\ncontravention of those provisions. 1.3.7 Limitation of Liability of an LLP and its partners \\n•\\nUnder the LLP Act, 2008 an obligation of an LLP arising out of a contract \\nor otherwise, will be solely the obligation of the LLP; \\n•\\nThe Liabilities of an LLP should be met out of the properties of the LLP; \\n•\\nA partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, for an obligation \\nreferred to above, solely by reason of being a partner in the LLP; \\n•\\n an LLP is not bound by anything done by a partner in dealing with a \\nperson, if: \\n•\\n The partner does not have the authority to act on behalf of the LLP in \\ndoing a particular act; and \\n•\\nThe other person knows that the partner has no authority or does not \\nknow or believe him to be a partner in the LLP \\nThe liability of the LLP and the partners perpetrating fraudulent dealings will be \\nunlimited for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the LLP.

Registration: Registration is mandatory for LLPs, and they can sue or be \\nsued in their own name. For Partnership firms, registration is voluntary. 6. Perpetual Succession: LLPs have perpetual succession; the change in \\nmembers does not affect its existence. Partnership firms do not have \\nperpetual succession; changes in partners may affect the firm\\'s existence. 7. Name: The name of an LLP must contain \"limited liability partnership\" or \\n\"LLP\" as a suffix. Partnership firms have no specific naming guidelines. 8. Liability: In an LLP, each partner\\'s liability is limited to their contribution \\nexcept in cases of willful fraud. In a Partnership firm, each partner\\'s liability \\ncan be extended up to their personal assets. 9. Mutual Agency: In an LLP, each partner can bind the LLP by their actions \\nbut not the other partners. In a Partnership firm, each partner can bind the \\nfirm and the other partners by their actions. 10.Designated Partners: LLPs must have at least two designated partners, \\none of whom must be a resident in India. Partnership firms do not have \\nprovisions for designated partners. 11.Number of Partners: LLPs require a minimum of two partners but have no \\nmaximum limit. Partnership firms also require a minimum of two partners \\nbut have a maximum of fifty. 12.Legal Compliances: In LLPs, only designated partners are responsible for \\nlegal compliances and penalties under the Act. In Partnership firms, all \\npartners share this responsibility. 13.Foreign Partnership: LLPs allow foreign nationals to become partners in \\nan LLP. Partnership firms do not permit foreign nationals to become \\npartners. 14.Minor as Partner: A minor cannot be admitted to the benefits of an LLP, \\nwhereas a minor can be admitted to the benefits of a partnership with the \\nconsent of the existing partners. 5.MAIN CLAUSES IN A PARTNERSHIP DEED \\nThe relation between the partners is governed by mutual agreement known as \\npartnership deed. It should be comprehensive to avoid disputes later on. It is \\nusual therefore, to find the following clauses in a Partnership Deed which may or \\nmay not be registered. 1.'), Document(page_content=\"Name of the firm and the partners; \\n2. Commencement and duration of business; \\n3. Amount of capital to be contributed by each partner; \\n4. Amount to be allowed to each partner as drawings and the timings of such \\ndrawings; \\n5. Rate of interest to be allowed to each partner on his capital and on his loan \\nto the firm, and to be charged on his drawings; \\n6. The ratio in which profits or losses are to be shared; \\n7. Whether a partner will be allowed to draw any salary; \\n8. Any variations in the mutual rights and duties of partners; \\n9. Method of valuing goodwill on the occasions of changes in the constitution \\nof the firm; \\n10. Procedure by which a partner may retire and the method of payment of his \\ndues; \\n11. Basis of the determination of the executors of a deceased partner and the \\nmethod of payment; \\n12. Treatment of losses arising out of the insolvency of a partner; \\n13. Procedure to be allowed for settlement of disputes among partners; \\n14. Preparation of accounts and their audit. Registration of the firm is not compulsory, but non-registration restricts the \\npartners or the firm from taking any legal action. Often there is no written \\nPartnership Deed or, if there is one, it may be silent on a particular point. In that \\ncase the relevant sections of the Partnership Act will apply. If on any point the \\nPartnership Deed contains a clause, it will hold good; otherwise the provisions of \\nthe Act relating to the questions will apply. Rules in the absence of Partnership Deed \\nIn the absence of any agreement to the contrary; \\nTypical Stipulations in a Partnership Agreement \\nA partnership agreement often includes specific provisions related to the \\nfinancial arrangements among partners. Some standard clauses are: \\nSalary: No partner is entitled to a salary for their involvement in the partnership's \\noperations, as their compensation is typically derived from the profits earned by \\nthe firm. Interest on Capital: Partners are not to receive interest on the capital they have \\ninvested in the partnership. The capital contribution is considered a part of the \\nownership stake and not a loan that accrues interest. Interest on Drawings: No interest is charged on the amounts that partners \\nwithdraw from the business for personal use. These drawings are typically \\ndeducted from the partner's capital account or their share of the profits. Interest on Partner's Loan: If a partner extends a loan to the firm beyond their \\ncapital contribution, they are entitled to interest at a predetermined rate, often \\ncited as 6% per annum in the agreement. Sharing of Profits and Losses: Profits and losses resulting from the partnership's \\nactivities are to be divided equally among partners, regardless of their individual \\ncapital contributions or efforts, unless otherwise agreed upon. These clauses are designed to ensure a clear understanding of the financial rights \\nand obligations of each partner within the partnership structure. Note: In the absence of an agreement, the interest and salary payable to a partner \\nwill be paid only if there is profit. 6.POWERS OF PARTNERS \\nThe Partners are supposed to have the power to act in certain matters and not to \\nhave such powers in others. In other words, unless a public notice has been given \\nto the contrary, certain contracts entered into by a partner on behalf of the \\npartnership, even without consulting other partners are binding on the firm and \\nthe provisions of the Act relating to the question will apply. In case of a trading \\nfirm, the implied powers of partners are the following: \\na) Buying and selling of goods; \\nb) Receiving payments on behalf of the firm and giving valid receipt; \\nc) Drawing cheques and drawing, accepting and endorsing bills of exchange \\nand promissory notes in the name of the firm;  \\nd) Borrowing money on behalf of the firm with or without pledging the \\ninventories-intrade; \\ne) Engaging servants for the business of the firm. In certain cases an individual partner has no power to bind the firm.\"), Document(page_content='This is to say \\nthat third parties cannot bind the firm unless all the partners have agreed. These \\ncases are: \\na.'), Document(page_content='Submitting a dispute relating to the firm arbitration; \\nb. Opening a bank account on behalf of the firm in the name of a partner; \\nc. Compromise or relinquishment of any claim or portion of claim by the \\nfirm; \\nd. Withdrawal of a suit or proceeding filed on behalf of the firm; \\ne. Admission of any liability in a suit or proceedings against the firm; \\nf. Acquisition of immovable property belonging to the firm; \\ng. Entering into partnership on behalf of the firm.'), Document(page_content=\"The rights, duties and powers of partners can be changed by mutual consent. 7.ACCOUNTS \\nPartnership Act doesn't specify any format for preparation of accounts of \\nPartnership Firm and thus accounts are prepared as per Basic rules of accounts. There is not much difference between the accounts of a partnership firm and that \\nof sole proprietorship (provided there is no change in the firm itself). The only \\ndifference to be noted is that instead of one Capital Account there will be as many \\nCapital Accounts as there are partners. If, for instance, there are three partners; \\nA, B, and C, then there will be a Capital Account for each one of the partners; A's \\nCapital Account will be credited by the amount contributed by him as capital and \\nsimilarly B's and C's Capital Accounts will be credited with the amounts brought \\nin by them respectively as capital. When a partner takes money out of the firms for his domestic purpose, either his \\nCapital Account can be debited or a separate account, named as Drawings \\nAccount, can be opened in his name and the account may be debited. In a Trial \\nBalance of a partnership firm, therefore, one may find Capital Accounts of \\npartners as well as Drawings Accounts. Finally the Drawings Account of a partner \\nmay be transferred to his Capital Account so that a net figure is available. But, \\noften the Drawings Account or Current Account (as it is usually called) remains \\nseparate. 8.PROFIT AND LOSS APPROPRIATION \\nDuring the course of business, a partnership firm will prepare Trading Account \\nand a Profit and Loss Account at the end of every year. The final accounts of a \\nsole proprietorship concern will not differ from the accounts of a partnership \\nfirm. The Profit and Loss Account will show the profit earned by the firm or loss \\nsuffered by it. This profit or loss has to be transferred to the Capital Accounts of \\npartners according to the terms of the Partnership Deed or according to the \\nprovisions of the Indian Partnership Act (if there is no Partnership Deed or if the \\nDeed is silent on a particular point). Suppose the Profit and Loss Account reveals \\na profit of ₹ 90,000.\"), Document(page_content=\"There are two partners, A and B. A devotes all his time to \\nthe firm; B does not. A's capital is ₹ 50,000 and \\n 's is \\n. There is no \\nPartnership Deed.\"), Document(page_content=\"In such a case the profit will be distributed among \\n and  \\nequally. This is irrespective of the fact that \\n does not work as much as A does \\nand B's capital is much less than that of A. But if the Partnership Deed lays down \\nthat \\n is to get a salary and interest is to be allowed on the capital, then first of \\nall, from the profit earned, A's salary must be deducted and interest on the \\nCapital Accounts of both partners will be deducted. The remaining profit will be \\ndivided equally between \\n and \\n. Further if the Partnership Deed says that \\nprofits are to be divided in the ratio of, say, threefourth to  and one-fourth to , \\nthen this will be the ratio to be adopted. In a partnership, profit has to be divided between the partners in a certain profit \\nsharing ratio after making necessary adjustments stated in the partnership deed \\nsuch as interest on capitals, drawings and loans; salaries or/and commission to \\npartners etc. Accordingly, an additional account is prepared and net profit is \\ntransferred from the debit side of the profit and loss account to the credit side of \\nthis new account which is called Profit and Loss Appropriation Account and \\nbefore the profit is divided between partners, it is necessary to record the above \\nstated adjustments in this account. B′￼\\n₹20,000\\nA\\nB\\nB\\nA\\nA\\nB\\nA\\nB\\nThe student can see for himself that if salary is to be allowed to a partner, the \\nProfit and Loss Appropriation Account will be debited and the Partner's Capital \\nAccount will be credited. Similarly, if interest is to be allowed on capital, the \\nProfit and Loss Appropriation Account will be debited and the respective Capital \\nAccounts will be credited. Let us take an illustration to understand how to divide profits among partners. 9.FIXED AND FLUCTUATING CAPITAL \\nYou have seen in the above example that the Capital Account of A has changed \\nfrom ₹ 30,000 at the beginning to ₹ 33,800 and B's Capital A/c from ₹ 20,000 \\nto ₹ 23,200. This is because we have made entries in respect of interest, salary, \\nprofit earned during the year and money taken out by the partners in the Capital \\nAccount itself. If the Capital Accounts are prepared on this basis, capitals are said \\nto be fluctuating. Some firms, however, prefer to continue to show the Capital \\nAccounts of the partners at the same old figure. This means that no entry is to be \\nmade in the Capital Account in respect of interest, salary, profit and drawings etc. A separate account is to be opened for this purpose. This account is known as the \\nCurrent Account or even as Drawings Account. Under this system interest on \\ncapital if allowed, should be calculated only on the amount of the fixed capital. If \\nthe capital Accounts are prepared on this basis, capitals are said to be fixed. Thus, there are two methods of accounting - \\ni. Fixed capital method and \\nii. Fluctuating capital method. In Fixed capital method, generally initial capital contributions by the partners \\nare credited to partners' capital accounts and all subsequent transactions and \\nevents are dealt with through current accounts, Unless a decision is taken to \\nchange it, initial capital account balance is not changed. In Fluctuating capital method, no current account is maintained. All such \\ntransactions and events are passed through capital accounts. Naturally, capital \\naccount balance of the partners fluctuates every time. So in fixed capital method a \\nfixed capital balance is maintained over a period of time while in fluctuating \\ncapital method capital account balances fluctuate all the time. 1.9.1 Interest on Capital: \\nA partner is not entitled to interest on his capital as a matter of right. But if there \\nis an agreement, that partner would receive interest on his capital it is paid at the \\nagreed rate only out of profits. Interest on capital is generally calculated on the \\nopening balance and allowance is made for any additions of capital or \\nwithdrawals there from during the accounting period. •\\nThe amount of interest is debited to interest on capital accounts and \\ncredited to the capital accounts, if capitals are fluctuating and current \\naccounts, if capitals are fixed. Interest on capital account is then closed by \\ntransfer to profit and loss appropriation account. •\\nAlternatively, credit the capital (or current) account of the partner \\nconcerned and debit the profit and loss appropriation account. For interest on capital \\nProfit and Loss Appropriation Account Dr. To (Individual) Capital (or Current) Accounts of Partners \\nInterest is generally allowed on capitals of the partners. Interest on capital of \\npartners is calculated for the relevant period for which the amount of capital has \\nbeen used in the business. Normally, it is charged for full year on the balance of \\ncapital at the beginning of the year unless some fresh capital is introduced during \\nthe year. On the additional capital introduced, interest for the relevant period of \\nutilization is calculated. For example, A has \\n capital in the beginning of \\nthe year and introduces ₹10,000 during the year. If rate of interest on capital is \\n p.a., interest on A's capital is calculated as follows: \\n \\nIn case of fixed capital accounts, interest is calculated on the balance of capital \\naccounts only and no interest is payable / chargeable on the balance of current \\naccounts. Net loss and Interest on Capital: Subject to contract between the partners, \\ninterest on capitals is to be provided out of profits only. Thus in case of loss, no \\ninterest is provided. But in case of insufficient profits (i.e., net profit less than the \\namount of interest on capital), the amount of profit is distributed in the ratio of \\ncapital as partners get profit by way of interest on capital only. 1.9.2 Interest on Drawings \\nSometimes interest is not only allowed on the capitals, but is also charged on \\ndrawings. In such a case, interest will be charged according to the time that \\nelapses between the taking out of the money and the end of the year.\"), Document(page_content=\"Method 1: Product Method: When Unequal amount is withdrawn at different \\ntime period. ₹30,000\\n20%\\n[30,000 × 20\\n100 ] + [10,000 × 20\\n100 × 6\\n12 ] = ₹6,000 + ₹1,000 = ₹7,000\\nSuppose , a partner, has drawn the following sum of money - \\nOn 29th February, 2022 \\n500 \\nOn 31st March, 2022 \\n400 \\nOn 30th June, 2022 \\n600 \\nOn 31st October, 2022 \\n800 \\nAccounts are closed on 31st December every year. Interest is chargeable on \\ndrawings at 6% per annum. The interest on X's drawings will be calculated as \\nshown below: \\nOn ₹500 for 10 months, i.e., ₹25 \\nOn ₹400 for 9 months, i.e., ₹18 \\nOn ₹600 for 6 months, i.e., ₹18 \\nOn ₹800 for 2 months, i.e., ₹8 \\nTotal: ₹69 \\nAlternatively, it can be calculated as follows: \\nAmount (₹) | Number of months | Product \\n500 | 10 | 5,000 \\n400 | 9 | 3,600 \\n600 | 6 | 3,600 \\n800 | 2 | 1,600 \\nTotal: ₹2,300 | | 13,800 \\nInterest on ₹ 13,800 for one month at \\n per annum is ₹ 69 . If the dates on which amounts are drawn are not given, the student will do well to \\ncharge interest for six months on the whole of the amount on the assumption that \\nthe money was drawn evenly through out the year. In the above example, the \\ntotal drawings come to ₹ 2,300; and at \\n for 6 months, the interest comes to ₹ \\n69 . The entry to record interest on drawings is- debit the Capital Account of the \\nX\\n6%\\n6%\\npartner concerned (or his Current Account if the capital is fixed) and credit the \\nProfit and Loss Appropriation Account. If withdrawals are made evenly in the beginning of each month, interest can be \\ncalculated easily for the whole of the amount of 6-1/2 months; if withdrawals are \\nmade at the end of each month, interest should be calculated for 5-1/2 months. If \\nwithdrawals are mode at the beginning of each quarter, interest can be calculated \\nby Total drawings  Rate \\n. However, if withdrawals are at end of each quarter, the formula : Total drawings \\n Rate \\n \\n will apply. 1.9.3 Guarantee of Minimum Profit \\nSometimes, one partner can enjoy the right to have minimum amount of profit in \\na year as per the terms of the partnership agreement. In such case, allocation of \\nprofit is done in a normal way if the share of partner, who has been guaranteed \\nminimum profit, is more than the amount of guaranteed profit. However, if share \\nof the partner is less than the guaranteed amount, he takes minimum profit and \\nthe excess of guaranteed share of profit over the actual share is borne by the \\nremaining partners as per the agreement. There are three possibilities as far as share of deficiency by other partners is \\nconcerned. These are as follows: \\n•\\nExcess is payable by one of the remaining partners. •\\n Excess is payable by at least two or all the partners in an agreed ratio. •\\nExcess is payable by remaining partners in their mutual profit sharing \\nratio. If the question is silent about the nature of guarantee, the burden of guarantee is \\nborne by the remaining partners in their mutual profit sharing ratio. 1.9.4 Capital ratio \\nPartners may agree to share profits and losses in the capital ratio. When capitals \\nare fixed, profits will be shared in the ratio of given capitals. But if capitals are \\nfluctuating and partners introduce or withdraw capitals during the year, the \\ncapitals for the purpose of ratio would be determined with reference to time on \\nthe basis of weighted average method. ×\\n× 100 × 7.5/12\\n×\\n× 100 × 4.5/12\\nUNIT - 2: TREATMENT OF GOODWILL IN PARTNERSHIP \\nACCOUNTS \\n 2.1 GOODWILL \\nGoodwill is the value of reputation of a firm in respect of profits expected in \\nfuture over and above the normal rate of profits. In simpler terms, Goodwill is nothing more than the probability that old \\ncustomer will resort to old place again and again.\"), Document(page_content='The capacity of a business to \\nearn super profits in the future is basically what is meant by term goodwill. Goodwill is an intangible asset; it cannot be seen; it cannot be felt; it cannot \\nbe transported physically.'), Document(page_content='Even then it is very real.'), Document(page_content='From accounting point of \\nview, it is necessary that it has some monetary or saleable value. The implication \\nof the term over and above is that there is always a certain normal rate of profits \\nearned by similar firms in the same locality. The excess profit earned by a firm \\nmay be due to its locational advantage, better customer service, possession of a \\nunique patent right, personal reputation of the partner or for similar other \\nreasons. The necessity for valuation of goodwill in a firm arises in the following \\ncases: \\na) When the profit sharing ratio amongst the partners is changed; \\nb) When a new partner is admitted; \\nc) When a partner retires or dies; and \\nd) When the business is dissolved or sold.

An intangible asset must have the characteristics of an asset. It means that \\nit must have some value and must be clearly identifiable, so that it can be sold \\nwithout disposing other assets or future benefits flowing from other assets. ii. An intangible asset should be recognized only if the future probable \\neconomic benefits (i.e., increased revenue from sales) will flow to the \\nbusiness enterprise and not to others. It means that management can make \\nreasonable estimates of future benefits. iii.The cost of the intangible asset can be measured reliably, that is, the cost is \\nobjectively verifiable. If the cost cannot be measured reliably, then it cannot \\nbe recognized as an asset. It is thus clear that none of the conditions is satisfied by internally generated \\ngoodwill or inherent goodwill. The reasons are simple to explain.'), Document(page_content=\"First, it is not an \\nidentifiable resource like patent, trademark or copyright. Second, it is very \\ndifficult to assess its future benefits. Finally, the cost of internally generated \\ngoodwill cannot be reliably measured in the absence of any consideration in \\nmoney or money' worth. There is no documentary evidence to support the value \\nof goodwill as a resource. Goodwill should be recorded in the books only when some consideration in \\nmoney or money' worth has been paid for it. Accordingly, on admission or \\nretirement/death of a partner or even when there is a change in profit sharing \\nratio amongst the existing partners, goodwill should not be raised in the books of \\naccount of the partnership firm because no consideration in money or money' \\nworth has been paid for it. The conclusion is that only purchased goodwill should \\nbe recorded in the books of account whether the payment is made directly in cash \\nor money' worth. For example, '  ' and '  ' purchase the net assets (assets minus \\nliabilities) of '  ' amounting to ₹ 2,50,000 for ₹ 3,00,000 in cash, the additional \\npayment of ₹ 50,000 is a payment for goodwill in cash. It is a case of purchased \\ngoodwill (an asset) and can be validly recorded in the books of A and B. When no \\npayment is made for the purchase of goodwill and goodwill account is raised in \\nthe books, it is a case of internally generated goodwill or inherent goodwill and as \\nper Accounting Standards, it is not permitted. For example, in the event of \\nreconstitution of the firm due to admission, or retirement or death of a partner or \\neven a change in the profit sharing ratio without reconstitution, goodwill of the \\nfirm is evaluated. In such a situation, the value of goodwill should not be brought \\ninto books of account because it is inherent or self-generated goodwill since no \\nmoney or money' worth has been paid for it. The only way out is that the value of \\ngoodwill as calculated with the help of different valuation methods should be \\nadjusted through capital accounts of the partner(s) of the firm. In no case the \\ngoodwill account is to be raised in the books of account, either on the \\nreconstitution of the firm or change in the profit sharing ratio. The amount of goodwill is written off over a period of time. In case when the \\ngoodwill account exists at the time of reconstitution of firm, it should be written \\noff immediately whether it is internally generated or goodwill has been bought for \\nsome consideration. 2.2 METHODS FOR GOODWILL VALUATION \\nThere are three methods for valuation of goodwill \\n1. Average profit basis,-Simple and Weighted \\n2. Super profit basis,--Number of Year Purchase, Annuity basis, and \\nCapitalization of Super Profit \\n3. Capitalization basis- Average Profits \\n(1) Average Profit Basis: In this case the average profits of past years are \\nadjusted for any expected change in future. The number of year are decided on \\nthe basis of judgement and negotiation. •\\nFor averaging the past profit, either simple average or weighted average \\nmay be employed depending upon the circumstances. If there exists clear \\nincreasing or decreasing trend of profits, it is better to give more weight to \\nthe profits of the recent years than those of earlier years. But, if there is no \\nclear trend of profit, it is better to go by simple average. A\\nB\\nC\\n•\\nLet us suppose profits of a partnership firm for the last five years were ₹ \\n30,000, \\n, ₹ 60,000 and \\n. In this case, a clear \\nincreasing trend is noticed and therefore, average profit may be arrived at \\nby assigning appropriate weights as shown below : \\nYear 1: \\nProfit: ₹30,000, Weight: 1, Weighted Profit: ₹30,000 \\nYear 2: \\nProfit: ₹40,000, Weight: 2, Weighted Profit: ₹80,000 \\nYear 3: \\nProfit: ₹50,000, Weight: 3, Weighted Profit: ₹1,50,000 \\nYear 4: \\nProfit: ₹60,000, Weight: 4, Weighted Profit: ₹2,40,000 \\nYear 5: \\nProfit: ₹70,000, Weight: 5, Weighted Profit: ₹3,50,000 \\nTotal Weight: 15, Total Weighted Profit: ₹8,50,000 \\nSo, Weighted Average Profit \\n (approx) \\nIf goodwill is valued at three years' purchase of profit, then in this case the value \\nof goodwill is ₹ 56,667 (approx) \\n. However, if any such trend is not visible from the figures of past profits, then one \\nshould take simple average profit and calculate goodwill accordingly. Let us \\nsuppose, profits of a partnership firm for five years were ₹ 30,000 , ₹ 25,000 , ₹ \\n20,000 , ₹ 30,000 and ₹ 28,000 . In this case, there is no clear increasing or \\ndecreasing trend of profit.\"), Document(page_content=\"So average profit comes to ₹ 26,600 (arrived at by \\ntaking simple average). If the goodwill is valued by taking three years' of purchase \\nof profit, the ninth is case, value of goodwill becomes ₹ 79,800. Weighted average is used when profit has increasing or decreasing Trend. Highest weight is always given to current year, as it reflects the more realistic \\nview of the future profitability \\n₹40,000, ₹50,000\\n₹70,000\\n= 8,50, 000\\n15\\n= ₹56,667\\n× 3 = ₹1,70, 000\\n (2) Super Profit Basis: In case of super profit method, goodwill is valued on \\nthe basis of super profits earned by the firm. Super Profit=Actual Profit-Normal Profit \\nActual Profit is average maintainable profit \\nNormal Profit=Normal rate of Return (NRR)  Capital Employed \\nThe rationale for using the super profit is the partner who gains excess earning \\nowing to reconstitution of firm should compensate to partners sacrificing their \\nshare in the reconstitution.\"), Document(page_content=\"Super profit means, excess profit that can be earned \\nby a firm over and above the normal profit usually earned by similar firms under \\nsimilar circumstances. Under this method, the partner who gains in terms of \\nprofit sharing ratio has to contribute only for excess profit because normal profit \\nhe can earn by joining any partnership firm. Under super profit method, what \\nexcess profit a partnership firm can earn is to be determined first. Calculation of super profit: \\ni. Identify the capital employed by the partnership firm; \\nii. Identify the average profit earned by the partnership firm based on past \\nfew years' figures; \\niii.Determine normal rate of return prevailing in the locality of similar firms; \\niv. Apply normal rate of return on capital employed to arrive at normal profit; \\nv. Deduct normal profit from the average profit of the firm. If the average \\nprofit of the firm is more than the normal profit, there exists super profit and \\ngoodwill. Let us suppose, total capital employed by a partnership firm was ₹ 1,00,000 and \\nits average profit was ₹ 25,000 . Normal rate of return is \\n in case of similar \\nfirms working under similar conditions. So, normal profit is \\n and average \\nprofit is \\n. The partnership firm earns ₹ 3,000 super profit. a) Number of Years Purchase Method: Goodwill is generally valued by \\nmultiplying the amount of super profit by certain number of years depending \\nupon the expectation about the maintenance of such profit in future. If it is \\nexpected that the super profit can be maintained for another five years in \\nfuture, then value of goodwill may be taken as ₹ \\n = ₹ 15,000 . b) Annuity Method: The major drawback of number of number of years \\npurchase method is that time value of money is not considered. Although it \\nwas expected that super profit would be earned in five future years, still no \\ndevaluation was done on the value of money for the time difference. In fact \\n×\\n22%\\n₹22,000\\n₹25,000\\n3,000 × 5\\nwhen money will be received in different points of time, its value should be \\ndifferent depending upon the rate of interest.

The problem of compensation is the chief problem \\nwhile dealing with admission of a partner. This is tackled through goodwill. But one point should be made clear here. Goodwill is a compensation to old \\npartners for their sacrifice in connection with admission of a new partner. So it is \\nto be credited to the partners according to their profit sacrificing ratio.\"), Document(page_content=\"Whatever \\nshare the new partner is getting, it may be sacrificed by the old partners in \\nproportion to their old profit sharing ratio or in different proportion. For example, Nigam and Dhameja are in partnership sharing profits and losses \\nequally. They agreed to take Ghosh as one-third partner. Now one-third share of \\nGhosh may come out of sacrifice made by Nigam and Dhameja equally (i.e. at \\ntheir old profit sharing ratio). See the following profit sharing pattern: \\nProfit Sharing Pattern \\nPartners Nigam and Dhameja both originally had equal profit shares of 1/2. After \\nthe reconstitution of the partnership, Nigam's new share is calculated as 1/2 \\nminus 1/3 (being his share of Ghosh's incoming 1/3 share), resulting in a new \\nshare of 1/3. This represents a sacrifice of 1/6 from his original share. Similarly, \\nDhameja's new share is also 1/3, resulting in the same sacrifice of 1/6. Ghosh, a \\nnew partner, acquires a 1/3 share in the profits, which is the sum of the sacrifices \\nmade by Nigam and Dhameja. In other words, one-third share of Ghosh was borne by Nigam and Dhameja at \\ntheir old profit sharing ratio. By this process Nigam sacrificed \\n in \\nshare and Dhameja sacrificed \\n in share. So the profit sacrificing ratio becomes: \\nNigam\\t\\n     =\\t\\nDhameja \\n1/6             = \\t 1/6\\t\\n\\t\\n \\n1\\t\\n      :\\t\\n1 \\nWhich is the same as old profit sharing ratio. ₹20,000\\n₹5,000\\n₹15,000\\nA\\nB\\n₹9,000\\nB\\n₹6,000\\nB\\n₹2,000\\nC\\nA\\nB\\nA, B\\nC\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nC\\n1/2 −1/3 = 1/6\\n1/2 −1/3 = /1/6\\nBut if the new profit sharing ratio of Nigam, Dhameja and Ghosh becomes 4:2:3, \\nthen profit sacrificed by Nigam and Dhameja on Ghosh's admission is not at the \\nold profit sharing ratio.

Therefore, only purchased goodwill \\nshould be recorded in the books of the firm. In case of admission of a partner, \\ngoodwill cannot be raised in the books of the firm because no consideration in \\nmoney or money's worth is paid for it. If the incoming partner brings any \\npremium over and above his capital contribution at the time of his admission, \\nsuch premium should be distributed to other existing partners. When a new \\npartner is admitted to a firm, the old partners generally sacrifice in favour of the \\nnew partner in terms of lower profit sharing ratio in the future. Therefore, the \\npremium for goodwill brought in by the new partner shall be given to the existing \\npartners on the basis of profit sacrificing ratio.

If the difference is positive, then there is a profit sacrifice and in case the \\ndifference is negative, then there is a gain in terms of higher future profit sharing \\nratio.\"), Document(page_content=\"In case of admission of a partner, only those existing partners are entitled \\nto a share for goodwill who have sacrificed a part of their profits in favour of the \\nnew partner. Sometimes, goodwill may be evaluated in case of admission of a \\npartner when incoming partner is unable to bring in cash any premium for \\ngoodwill. In that situation also, the value of goodwill should not be raised in the \\nbooks since it is inherent goodwill. Rather it is preferable that such value of \\ngoodwill should be adjusted through partners' capital accounts. It may also be \\nnoted that when the incoming partner pays any premium for goodwill privately to \\nthe existing partners, no entry is required in the books of the firm. In that case, \\nthe amount to be paid to each partner should be calculated as per the profit \\nsacrificing ratio. If only new partner's profit sharing is given then profit \\nsacrificing ratio of old paterns would be same as old profit sharing ratio. 2.7 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF GOODWILL IN CASE OF \\nRETIREMENT OR DEATH OF A PARTNER \\nIn case of retirement of a partner, the continuing partners will gain in terms of \\nprofit sharing ratio. Therefore, they have to pay to retiring partner for his share of \\ngoodwill in the firm in the gaining ratio. Similarly, in case of death of the partner, \\nthe continuing partners should bear the share of goodwill due to the heirs of the \\ndeceased partner. For this purpose, the goodwill is valued on the date of the \\nretirement or death and adjusted through the capital accounts of the partners. UNIT - 3: ADMISSION OF A NEW PARTNER \\n3.1 INTRODUCTION \\nNew partners are admitted for the benefit of the partnership firm. New partner is \\nadmitted either for increasing the partnership capital or for strengthening the \\nmanagement of the firm. When a new partner joins a firm, it is desirable to bring \\nall appreciation or reduction in the value of assets into accounts as on the date of \\nadmission. Similarly, if the books contain any liability which has not been paid or \\nif the books do not contain a liability which has to be paid, suitable entries should \\nbe passed. The purpose of such entries is to make an updated Balance Sheet on \\nthe date of admission. Also, all profits which have accrued but not yet brought \\ninto books and similarly, all losses which have occurred but not recorded, should \\nnow be brought into books so that the Capital Accounts of the old partners reflect \\nthe proper figure. As a \\nresult of passing of such entries, any subsequent profits or losses will be \\nautomatically shared by the incoming partner along with old partners. Also the value of goodwill is to be assessed and proper accounting treatment is \\nrequired to bring the value of goodwill into books of accounts. Treatment for \\ngoodwill has already been discussed in unit 2 of this chapter. 3.2 REVALUATION ACCOUNT OR PROFIT AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT \\nACCOUNT \\nWhen a new partner is admitted into the partnership, assets are revalued and \\nliabilities are reassessed. A Revaluation Account (or Profit and Loss Adjustment \\nAccount) is opened for the purpose. This account is debited with all reduction in \\nthe value of assets and increase in liabilities and credited with increase in the \\nvalue of assets and decrease in the value of liabilities.\"), Document(page_content=\"The difference in two sides \\nof the account will show profit or loss. This is transferred to the Capital Accounts \\nof old partners in the old profit sharing ratio. The entries to be passed are: \\nJournal Entries for Revaluation of Assets and Liabilities in Partnership \\nWhen revaluing assets and liabilities in a partnership, the following journal \\nentries are made: \\n1. Revaluation Account Entries: \\nDebit (Dr.) Revaluation Account for decreases in asset values. To individual Asset Accounts showing a decrease. Debit (Dr.) Revaluation Account for increases in liabilities. To individual Liability Accounts that need to be increased. 2. Asset and Liability Revaluation Entries: \\nDebit (Dr.) individual Asset Accounts for increases in the value of assets. Debit (Dr.) Liability Accounts for any reduction in liabilities. Credit (Cr.) Revaluation Account for both the above entries. 3. Profit or Loss on Revaluation: \\nDebit (Dr.) Revaluation Account for the profit resulting from revaluation, which \\nis then credited to the Capital Accounts of the old partners according to the old \\nprofit-sharing ratio. If there is a loss on revaluation, Debit (Dr.) the Capital Accounts of the old \\npartners and Credit (Cr.) the Revaluation Account, again according to the old \\nprofit-sharing ratio. These entries ensure that any changes in the value of the firm's assets and \\nliabilities are accurately reflected in the accounts and that the effects on the \\npartners' capital accounts are allocated according to the previously agreed-upon \\nprofit-sharing arrangement. As a result of the above entries, the capital account balances of the old partners \\nwill change and the assets and liabilities will have to be adjusted to their proper \\nvalues. They will now appear in the Balance Sheet at revised figures. When the revised values are not to be Recognised in the books \\nSometimes all the partners including the new partner may agree to keep the \\nassets and liabilities at the old values even when they agree to revalue them. To \\nrecord these, a Memorandum Revaluation Account is opened. This account is \\ndivided into two parts. a) In the first part the entries for the revaluation of assets and liabilities are \\nmade in the usual way as explained earlier. No record for the revaluation of \\nassets and liabilities is made through the respective ledger accounts. The \\nresultant profit or loss on revaluation in the first part of this account is \\ntransferred to the capital accounts of old partners only in the old profit and \\nloss sharing ratio. b) In order to complete the double entry, entries made in the first part of \\nMemorandum Revaluation Account are reversed in the second part so that \\nthe values of the assets and liabilities remain unchanged. The balance of the \\nsecond part is transferred to the capital accounts of all the partners including \\nnew partner in their new profit and loss sharing ratio. Thus if there is a profit \\nin the first part there will be a loss of the same amount in the second part. The only point to be remembered is that the result of the first part of \\nMemorandum Revaluation Account is shared by old partners in the old profit \\nsharing ratio, while the result of the second part is shared by all partners \\nincluding the new one in the new profit sharing ratio. Alternatively, the partners may agree that revalued figures will not be shown in \\nthe Balance Sheet and Assets and liabilities would appear in the Balance Sheet at \\ntheir old values. In this case, Memorandum Revaluation Account is opened. Any increase in the \\nvalue of assets and/or decrease in the liabilities is credited to Memorandum \\nRevaluation Account. The journal entry will be: \\nAssets Accounts\\t\\nDr. (with increase in the value of individual assets) \\nLiabilities Accounts\\tDr. (With decrease in the value of individual liabilities) \\nTo Memorandum Revaluation Account \\nSimilarly, any decrease in the value of assets and/or increase in the liabilities is \\ndebited to Memorandum Revaluation Account. The journal entry will be: \\nMemorandum Revaluation Account Dr. To Assets Accounts \\n(with increase in the value of individual assets) \\nTo Liabilities Accounts (with decrease in the value of individual liabilities) \\nIf the credit side of the Memorandum Revaluation Account is more than the debit \\nside, there is a profit.

The journal entry will be: \\nMemorandum Revaluation Account Dr. To Old Partners' Capital Accounts \\nIf the debit side of the Memorandum Revaluation Account is more than the credit \\nside, there is a loss which is transferred to old Partner's Capital Accounts in the \\nold profit sharing ratio.

The profit on revaluation is to be transferred \\nto all Partners' Capital Accounts in the new profit sharing ratio. The journey entry \\nwill be: \\nMemorandum Revolution Account Dr. To All Partners' Capital Accounts (New profit and loss sharing ratio) \\nThe loss on revaluation should be transferred to all Partners' Capital Accounts in \\nthe new profit sharing ratio. The journal entry will be: \\nAll Partners' Capital Accounts Dr. (New profit and loss sharing ratio) \\nTo Memorandum Revaluation Account \\nIt should be noted that if there is a profit in the first half of the Memorandum \\nRevaluation Account, the later half of the Memorandum Revaluation Account \\nmust show a loss. Conversely, if the first half of the Memorandum Revaluation \\nAccount shows a loss, the later half of the Memorandum Revaluation Account \\nmust show a profit. When a Memorandum Revaluation Account is prepared, the book values of assets \\nand liabilities do not change. In effect, the resultant profit or loss on revaluation \\nis adjusted through the Partners' Capital Accounts. In this way, the amount \\ninvested as a capital by the incoming partner may be set at a level that reflects the \\ncurrent fair value of the partnership, even though the book values of assets and \\nliabilities of the existing partnership remain unchanged in the books of accounts. In case partners desire to disclose assets and liabilities in the balance sheet at old \\nfigures without opening Revaluation account then the change (i.e. increase or \\ndecrease) in the value of assets and liabilities may be adjusted through Partners' \\nCapital Accounts directly. Difference between Revaluation Account and Memorandum \\nRevaluation Account \\n1. Revaluation account is prepared to find out the profit or loss on revaluation of \\nassets and liabilities which appear in the new balance sheet at the new or \\nrevalued figures. Memorandum revaluation account is also prepared to record \\nthe effect of revaluation of assets and liabilities which of course are recorded \\nat their old figures in the new balance sheet. 2. Revaluation account is not divided into two parts. But the memorandum \\nrevaluation account has two parts: first part for old partners and second part \\nfor all partners including the new partner. 3. The net result of revaluation of assets and liabilities in the revaluation account \\nis transferred to old partners' capital accounts in the old profit sharing ratio. In the case of memorandum revaluation account the first part is used to \\nrecord the changes in the values of assets and liabilities due to revaluation and \\nin the second part the effect of the first part is cancelled. The balance of the \\nfirst part is transferred to old partner's capital accounts in the old profit \\nsharing ratio while the balance of the second part is transferred to all partners \\nincluding the new partner in the new profit sharing ratio. 3.3 RESERVES IN THE BALANCE SHEET \\nWhenever a new partner is admitted, any reserve etc. appearing in the Balance \\nSheet should be transferred to the Capital Accounts of the old partners in the old \\nprofit sharing ratio. The necessary journal entry would be: \\nDebit: Reserves or Profit and Loss Account \\nCredit: Old Partners' Capital Accounts (In the old profit sharing ratio) \\n3.4 COMPUTATION OF NEW PROFIT SHARING RATIO \\nWhen a new partner is admitted and there is no agreement to the contrary, it is \\nsupposed that old partners will continue to have inter se at the old profit sharing \\nratio. For example, A and B are in partnership sharing profits and losses at the ratio of \\n3:2. They admitted  as \\n partner. For computation of new profit sharing ratio.\"), Document(page_content=\"i.

Readjustment takes place in case of retirement of a partner likewise the case \\nof admission of a partner. Whenever a partner retires, the continuing partners \\nmake gain in terms of profit sharing ratio.

Assets and liabilities are revalued, value of goodwill is raised and surrender value \\nof joint life policy, if any, is taken into account. Revaluation profit and reserves \\nare transferred to capital or current accounts of partners. Lastly, final amount \\ndue to the retiring partner is determined and discharged. 4.2.CALCULATION OF GAINING RATIO \\nOn retirement of a partner, the continuing partners will gain in terms of profit \\nsharing ratio. For example, if \\n and \\n were sharing profits and losses in the \\nratio of 5:3:2 and  retires, then  and \\n have to decide at which ratio they will \\nshare profits and losses in future. If it is decided that the continuing partners will \\nshare profits and losses in future at the ratio of 3:2, then A gains 1/10th [(3/5)-\\n(5/10)] and C gains 2/10 [(2/5)-(2/10)]. So the gaining ratio between  and \\n is \\n. If \\n and \\n decide to continue at the ratio \\n, this indicates that they are \\ndividing the gained share in the previous profit sharing ratio. Thus, on the retirement or death of a partner, his share in the profit would be \\ntaken by the remaining partners. In other words, they get additional share which \\nis obviously a gain or benefit. The calculation of gaining ratio or benefit ratio is \\ndone as follows: \\nA, B\\nC\\nB\\nA\\nC\\nA\\nC\\n1:2\\nA\\nC\\n5:2\\ni. When the new ratio is given, gaining ratio is calculated by deducting their \\nnew share of profits from the old share. ii. When the new profit sharing ratio is not given and the remaining partners \\nshare the future profits in the same ratio as before, the gaining ratio would be \\nthe old profit sharing ratio. Observe the following table: \\nRatio between Remaining Partners \\n1. When new ratio is given: As given in the examination problem; Gaining or \\nBenefit Ratio: New Ratio minus Old ratio. 2. When the new Ratio is not given: The same old ratios between them; \\nGaining or Benefit Ratio: The same old ratios between them. 3.

If there is revaluation profit, then such profit \\nshould be distributed amongst the existing partners including the retiring partner \\nat the existing profit sharing ratio.'), Document(page_content=\"On the other hand, if there is loss on \\nrevaluation that is also to be distributed to all the partners including the retiring \\npartner at the existing profit sharing ratio. To arrive at, profit or loss on \\nrevaluation of assets and liabilities, a Revaluation Account or Profit and Loss \\nAdjustment Account is opened. Revaluation Account or Profit and Loss \\nAdjustment Account is closed automatically by transfer of profit or loss balance \\nto the Partners' Capital Accounts. If it is decided that revalued figures of assets and liabilities will not appear in the \\nbalance sheet of the continuing partners, then a journal entry should be passed \\nwith the amount payable or chargeable to the retiring partner which the \\ncontinuing partners will share at the ratio of gain. In the first instance, the \\njournal entry for distribution of profit or loss on revaluation which will appear in \\nthe balance sheet also is as follows: \\nRevaluation \\n                            Dr. To Partners' Capital A/cs \\n(For profit on revaluation) \\nOr Partners' Capital A/c's                                   Dr. To Revaluation \\n \\n(For loss on revaluation) \\nB's Capital A/c Dr. ₹5,000 \\nC's Capital A/c Dr. ₹5,000 \\nTo A's Capital A/c ₹10,000 \\nAlternatively, it is possible to account for the increase in the value of assets or \\ndecrease in the value of liabilities by debiting the appropriate asset account or \\nliability account and crediting partners' capital account at the existing profit \\nsharing ratio. Simultaneously the partners capital accounts are to be debited for \\nsuch gain at the new profit sharing ratio and the respective assets and liabilities \\naccount is to be credited again. So the following journal entries are necessary for \\n₹ 10,000 increase in sundry fixed assets and ₹ 2,000 decrease in trade payables: \\nSundry Fixed Assets A/c Dr. ₹10,000 \\nTrade payables A/c Dr. ₹2,000 \\nTo A's Capital A/c ₹4,000 \\nTo B's Capital A/c ₹4,000 \\nTo C's Capital A/c ₹4,000 \\n(Distribution of Revaluation Profit amongst the existing partners in the old profit \\nsharing ratio) \\nB's Capital A/c Dr. ₹6,000 \\nA/c\\nA/C\\nC's Capital A/c Dr. ₹6,000 \\nTo Sundry Fixed Assets A/c ₹10,000 \\nTo Trade payables A/c ₹2,000 \\n(Being revalued assets and liabilities are not required to be shown in the Balance \\nSheet) \\nIn this case it is not necessary to open a separate Revaluation Account.

However, sometimes it is stated that the loan is to be paid off in so many equal \\ninstalments and that the balance is to carry interest. In such case, what should be \\ndone is that the loan should be divided into equal parts. The interest for the \\nperiod should be calculated and the payment should consist of the instalment on \\naccount of the loan plus interest for the period.

The annual instalment on account of \\nloan comes to \\n. For the first year the first interest is ₹ 1,800 i.e. on \\n. In the first year the amount to be paid will be ₹ 9,300.

The firm pays the premium and the amount of policy is payable to \\nthe firm on the death of any partner or on the maturity of policy whichever is \\nearlier.\"), Document(page_content=\"The objective of taking such a policy is to minimize the financial \\nhardships to the event of payment of a large sum to the legal representatives of a \\ndeceased partner or to the retiring partner. The accounting treatment for the premium paid and the Joint Life Policy may be \\non any of the following ways: \\n1. When premium paid is treated as an expense: When premium is \\ntreated as an expense then it is closed every year by transferring to profit \\nand loss account. In this case complete amount received from the \\ninsurance company either on a surrender of policy or on the death of the \\npartner becomes a gain. Accounting entries are: \\na)\\nOn payment of premium \\nJoint Life Policy Insurance Premium A/c \\nDr. To Bank A/c \\nb)\\nOn charging to Profit and Loss Account \\nProfit and Loss Account Dr. To Joint Life Policy Insurance Premium A/c \\nc)\\nOn maturity of the Policy \\nInsurance Company/ Bank Account Dr. To Partners' Capital A/cs (individually) \\n(Including the account of the representative of a deceased partner) \\n2. When premium paid is treated as an asset: In this case insurance \\npremium paid is first debited to life policy account and credited to bank \\naccount. At the end of the year the amount in excess of surrender value is \\ntreated as a loss and is transferred to Profit and Loss Account. In this case \\nthe amount received from the insurance company in excess of the \\nsurrender value results in a gain at the time of receipt of such amount \\nwhich is transferred to Capital Accounts of the partners in the profit \\nsharing ratio. 3. Creation of Joint Policy Reserve Account: Under this method, \\npremium paid is debited to policy account and credited to bank account. At the end of the year, amount equal to premium is transferred from Profit \\nand Loss Appropriation Account to Policy Reserve Account. After this, \\npolicy account is brought down to its surrender value by debiting the life \\npolicy reserve account with amount which exceeds the surrender value of \\nthe policy. Thus, in this method, policy account appears on the assets side \\nand policy reserve account appears on the liabilities side of the Balance \\nSheet until it is realized. Both these accounts appear in the Balance Sheet \\nat the surrender value of the policy. This method is different from the \\nmethod discussed in (2) above only in respect of reserve account. On the death of a partner Joint Life Policy Reserve Account is transferred to Joint \\nLife Policy Account and then the balance is transferred to Partners' Capital \\nAccounts. 4.8.SEPARATE LIFE POLICY \\nInstead of life policy taken jointly on the name of all the partners, all the partners \\nmay take individual life policies for each of them by paying the premium from the \\nfirm. In the event of retirement, the retired partner is entitled for the \\nproportionate amount of the life policies of all the partners. Example: Sona, Gabbu and Amit are partners Profit sharing ratio is 3:1:1 \\nPolicy values and surrender values for Sona, Gabbu, and Amit are as follows: \\n➢Sona has a policy valued at ₹1,00,000 with a surrender value of ₹10,000. ➢Gabbu has a policy valued at ₹2,00,000 with a surrender value of \\n₹20,000. ➢Amit has a policy valued at ₹3,00,000 with a surrender value of ₹30,000. If Amit retires, then Amit will get ₹60,000 multiplied by 1/5, which equals \\n₹12,000.

If partner expires, then partners are entitled for share in JLP. Accounting for Joint Life Policy in Partnerships \\nA Joint Life Policy (JLP) is a life insurance policy that covers the lives of all \\npartners in a partnership firm. Upon the death of a partner or at the policy's \\nmaturity, the proceeds are used within the firm's financial management. There \\nare several methods for accounting for a JLP: \\n1. Premium Method: This method accounts for the JLP by considering the \\npremiums paid by the partnership as an expense. No asset is recognized on \\nthe balance sheet for the policy itself; instead, the premiums are treated as a \\nperiodic cost. 2. Surrender Value Method: In this approach, the JLP is recognized as an \\nasset at its surrender value. This is the amount the partnership would receive \\nif the policy were canceled. The difference between the premiums paid and \\nthe surrender value is treated as an expense or income, depending on \\nwhether the surrender value is less or more than the premiums paid.\"), Document(page_content=\"3. Joint Life Policy Reserve Method: This method involves creating a reserve \\naccount for the JLP. The reserve is built up by the amount of premiums paid, \\nless any surrender value received. The reserve represents the policy's value to \\nthe firm and is used to reflect the firm's interest in the policy's future \\nbenefits. Each of these methods has implications for how the partnership's financial \\nstatements are presented and how the benefits of the JLP are realized and \\ndistributed among the partners. Method 1: If Joint Life Policy does not appear in the Balance Sheet, then the \\nfirm will gain on the death of a partner.

Also, we will \\ndiscuss the special problems relating to the insolvency of partners and the \\nsettlement of the partnership's liabilities. 6.2.CIRCUMSTANCES  LEADIN  TO DISSOLUTION OF  \\nPARTNERSHIP \\nA partnership is dissolved or comes to an end on: \\na) the expiry of the term for which it was formed; \\nb) completion of the venture for which it was entered into;  \\nc) death of a partner; \\nd) insolvency of a partner. This list appears to be conditions or events that trigger a specific action or \\noutcome, possibly in a legal or business context, such as the termination or \\ndissolution of an agreement or partnership when any of these conditions are met. However, the partners or remaining partners (in case of death or insolvency) may \\ncontinue to do the business.\"), Document(page_content='In such a case there will be a new partnership but the \\nfirm will continue. When the business comes to an end then only it will be said \\nthat the firm has been dissolved. A firm stands dissolved in the following cases: \\ni. The partners agree that the firm should be dissolved; \\nii. All partners except one become insolvent; \\niii.The business becomes illegal; \\niv. In case of partnership at will, a partner gives notice of dissolution; and \\nv. The court orders dissolution. The court has the option to order dissolution of a firm in the following \\ncircumstances: \\na) Where a partner has become of unsound mind; \\nb) Where a partner suffers from permanent incapacity; \\nc) Where a partner is guilty of misconduct of the business; \\nd) Where a partner persistently disregards the partnership agreement; \\ne) Where a partner transfers his interest or share to a third party; \\nf) Where the business cannot be carried on except at a loss; and \\ng) Where it appears to be just and equitable. 6.3.CONSEQUENCES OF DISSOLUTION \\nOn the dissolution of a partnership, firstly, the assets of the firm, including \\ngoodwill, are realized. Then the amount realized, is applied first towards \\nrepayment of liabilities to outsiders and loans taken from partners; afterwards, \\nthe capital contributed by partners is repaid and, if there is still a surplus, it is \\ndistributed among the partners in their profit-sharing ratio. Conversely, after payment of liabilities of the firm and repayment of loans from \\npartners, if the assets of the firm leftover are insufficient to repay in full the \\ncapital contributed by each partner, the deficiency is borne by the partners in \\ntheir profit-sharing ratio. According to the provisions contained in section 48 of the Partnership Act, upon \\ndissolution of the partnership, the mutual rights of the partners, unless otherwise \\nagreed upon, are settled in the following manner: \\na) Losses including deficiencies of capital are paid, first out of profits, next \\nout of capital, and, lastly, if necessary, by the partners individually in the \\nproportion in which they are entitled to share profits. b) The assets of the firm, including any sums contributed by the partners to \\nmake up deficiencies of capital have to be applied in the following manner \\nand order: \\ni. in paying the debts of the firm to third parties; \\nii. in paying to each partner rateably what is due to him from the firm \\nin respect of advances as distinguished from capital; \\niii. in paying to each partner what is due to him on account of capital; \\nand \\niv. the residue, if any, to be divided among the partners in the \\nproportion in which they are entitled to share profits.

On 1st January, 2022 the firm was \\ndissolved. Fast took over the patents at a valuation of \\n. The other assets \\nrealized as under: \\nPlant and Machinery: ₹45,000 \\nStock: ₹22,000 \\nSundry Debtors: ₹18,500 \\nTotal: ₹85,500 \\nThe Sundry Creditors were paid off at a discount of \\n. The expense amounted to \\n₹ 3,500 . The steps to close the books are given below: \\nI. Open a Realization Account and transfer all assets except cash in hand or \\nat a bank at book values. Realization Account is debited and the various \\nassets are credited and thus closed. It should be remembered that Sundry \\nDebtors and Provisions for Bad Debts Accounts are two separate accounts \\nand the gross amount of debtors should be transferred. In the above example \\nthe entry will be: \\nRealization Account Dr. ₹90,000 \\nTo Plant and Machinery Account ₹40,000 \\nTo Patents Account ₹6,000 \\nTo Stock Account ₹25,000 \\nTo Sundry Debtors ₹19,000 \\n(Transfer of various assets to the debit side of Realization Account) \\nII.

The actual amount paid to creditors should be debited to the \\nRealization Account and Cash Account is credited: \\nRealization Account Dr. 19,000 \\nTo Cash Account 19,000 \\n(Payment of Sundry Creditors ₹20,000 less 5%) \\nii. If any liability is taken over by a partner, his Capital Account should \\nbe credited and Realization Account debited with the amount agreed upon. VI.At this stage, the Realization Account will show profit or loss. If the \\ndebit side is bigger, there is a loss; if the credit side is bigger, there is a profit. Profit or loss is transferred to the Capital Accounts of partners in the profit-\\nsharing ratio. In the case of profit, Realization Account is debited and Capital \\nAccounts are credited.

The entry \\ndebits Fast’s Loan Account by ₹10,000, indicating a decrease in the liability \\nassociated with the loan. Correspondingly, the Cash Account is credited by \\nthe same amount, indicating a reduction in the cash balance of the firm due \\nto the repayment of Fast’s loan. This entry effectively records the settlement \\nof the loan payable to Fast. VIII.Any reserve of accumulated profit or loss lying in the books (as shown by \\nthe Balance Sheet) should be transferred to the Capital Account in the profit-\\nsharing ratio. Thus: \\nThe document displays a journal entry concerning the distribution of a General \\nReserve. The General Reserve account is debited by ₹10,000, signifying the \\nutilization of reserved funds.

Pay off the liabilities, crediting cash, and debiting the liability accounts, \\nthe difference between the book figure and the amount paid being transferred \\nto the Realization Account. 3. Liabilities to outsiders may also be transferred to the Realization Account. In that case, the amount paid in respect of the liabilities in cash should be \\ndebited to the Realization Account, Cash Account being credited. If liability is \\ntaken over by a partner, Realization Account should be debited and the \\nPartners' Capital A/cs credited at the figure agreed upon. 4. The balance of the Realization Account will represent either the profit or \\nloss on realization. Divide it between the partners in the proportion in which \\nthey shared profits and losses. In the case of a loss, credit Realization \\nAccount and debit various partners' Capital Accounts; follow the opposite \\ncourse in the case of a profit. 5. Pay off the partners' loans or advances which are separate from the capital \\n(if any) contributed by them, after setting off against them any debit balance \\nin the capital account of the concerned partner. 6. The balance of the cash account at the end will be exactly equal to the \\nbalance of capital account, provided they are in credit; credit cash, and debit \\nthe partners' capital account with the amount payable to them to close their \\naccounts. 6.5.CONSEQUENCES OF INSOLVENCY OF A PARTNER \\nIf the capital account of a partner is in debit, after his share of loss or profit has \\nbeen adjusted therein, the firm will not have sufficient cash or assets to pay off \\nthe amounts due to the other partners, until the amount is repaid by the partner \\nwhose account is in debit. If however, the partner is insolvent, the amount will \\nnot be realized. In such a case, the deficiency may be borne by the solvent \\npartners in their profit-sharing ratio or according to the principle settled in the \\nwell-known case of Garner vs. Murray. In the latter case, the deficiency would be \\nborne by the solvent partners in proportion to their capitals and not in the \\nproportion in which they share profits and losses. If a partner goes insolvent then the following are the consequences: \\n1. The partner adjudicated as insolvent ceases to be a partner on the date on \\nwhich the order of adjudication is made. 2. The firm is dissolved on the date of the order of adjudication unless there \\nis a contract to the contrary. 3. The estate of the insolvent partner is not liable for any act of the firm after \\nthe date of the order of adjudication. 4. The firm cannot be held liable for any acts of the insolvent partner after \\nthe date of the order of adjudication. 6.6.LOSS ARISING FROM INSOLVENCY OF A PARTNER \\nWhen a partner is unable to pay his debt due to the firm, he is said to be insolvent \\nand the share of loss is to be borne by other solvent partners following the \\ndecision in the English case of Garner vs. Murray. According to this decision, solvent partners have to bear the loss due to \\ninsolvency of a partner and have to categorically put that the normal loss on \\nrealization of assets to be borne by all partners (including insolvent partner) in \\nthe profit-sharing ratio but a loss due to insolvency of a partner has to be borne \\nby the solvent partners in the capital ratio. The determination of capital ratio for this has been explained below.\"), Document(page_content='The \\nprovisions of the Indian Partnership Act are not contrary to Garner vs. Murray \\nrule.'), Document(page_content=\"However, if the partnership deed provides for a specific method to be \\nfollowed in case of insolvency of a partner, the provisions as per the deed should \\nbe applied. Capital Ratio on Insolvency \\n•\\nThe partners are free to have either fixed or fluctuating capitals in the \\nfirm. •\\nIf they are maintaining capitals at fixed amounts then all adjustments \\nregarding their share of profits, interest on capitals, drawings, interest on \\ndrawings, salary, etc. are done through Current Accounts, which may have \\ndebit or credit balances, and insolvency loss is distributed in the ratio of \\nfixed capitals. •\\nBut if capitals are not fixed and all transactions relating to drawings, \\nprofits, interest, etc., are passed through Capital Accounts then Balance \\nSheet of the business should not exhibit Current Accounts of the partners \\nand capital ratio will be determined after adjusting all the reserves and \\naccumulated profits to the date of dissolution, all drawings to the date of \\ndissolution, all interest on capitals and drawings to the date of dissolution \\nbut before adjusting profit or loss on Realization Account. •\\nIf some partner is having a debit balance in his Capital Account and is not \\ninsolvent then he cannot be called upon to bear the loss on account of the \\ninsolvency of other partner. Insolvency of all Partners \\n•\\nWhen the liabilities of the firm cannot be paid in full out of the firm's \\nassets as well as personal assets of the partners, then all the partners of the \\nfirm are said to be insolvent. Under such circumstances, it is better not to \\ntransfer the amount of creditors to Realization Account.\"), Document(page_content=\"The balance of the \\ncreditors' accounts is transferred to Deficiency Account. •\\nCreditors may be paid the amount available including the amount \\ncontributed by the partners. •\\n The unsatisfied portion of the creditor account is transferred to the \\nCapital Accounts of the partners in the profit-sharing ratio. Then Capital \\nAccounts are closed. In doing so first close the Partners' Capital Account \\nwhich is having the worst position.\"), Document(page_content='The last account will be automatically \\nclosed. 6.7.PIECEMEAL PAYMENTS \\nGenerally, the assets sold upon dissolution of partnership are realized only in \\nsmall instalments over a period of time. In such circumstances, the choice is \\neither to distribute whatever is collected or to wait till the whole amount is \\ncollected.'), Document(page_content=\"Usually, the first course is adopted. In order to ensure that the \\ndistribution of cash among the partners is in proportion to their interest in the \\npartanership concern either of the two methods described below may be followed \\nfor determining the order in which the payment should be made. 6.7.1.Maximum Loss Method \\nEach installment realized is considered to be the final payment i.e., outstanding \\nassets and claims are considered worthless and partners' accounts are adjusted \\non that basis each time when a distribution is made, following either Garner vs. Murray Rule or the profit-sharing ratio rule. 6.7.2.Highest Relative Capital Method \\nAccording to this method, the partner who has the higher relative capital, that is, \\nwhose capital is greater in proportion to his profit-sharing ratio, is first paid off. This method is also called as proportionate capital method. For determining the amount by which the capital of each partner is in excess of \\nhis relative capital, partners' capitals are first divided by figures that are in \\nproportion to their profitsharing ratio; the smallest quotient will indicate the \\nbasic capital. Having ascertained the partner who has the smallest basic capital, \\nthe amount of capital of other partners proportionate to the profit-sharing ratio \\nof the basic capital is calculated. These may be called as their hypothetical \\ncapitals. The amount of hypothetical capital of each partner is then subtracted \\nfrom the amount of his actual capital; the resultant figure will be the amount of \\nexcess capital held by him. By repeating the process once or twice, as may be \\nnecessary between the partners having excess capital, the amount by which the \\ncapital of each partner is in excess will be ascertained. The partner with the \\nlargest excess capital will be paid off first, followed by payment to the other or \\nothers who rank next to him until the capitals of partners are reduced to their \\nprofit-sharing ratio. The illustration given above is now worked out according to this method. Capital: \\nA: ₹ 15,000 \\nB: ₹ 18,000 \\nC: ₹ 9,000 \\nProfit-sharing ratio: \\nA: 2 \\nB: 2 \\nC: 1 \\nCapital divided by the profit-sharing ratio: \\nA: ₹ 7,500 \\nB: ₹ 9,000 \\nC: ₹ 9,000 \\nProportionate Capital of B and C, taking A’s capital as the base: \\nA: ₹ 15,000 \\nB: ₹ 15,000 \\nC: ₹ 7,500 \\nExcess of actual over proportionate capital: \\nA: ₹ nil \\nB: ₹ 3,000 \\nC: ₹ 1,500 \\nThis indicates that A should not get anything till \\n is paid to  and \\n is \\npaid to \\n. Since capital of \\n and \\n are already according to their mutual profit-\\nsharing ratio (2:1), they will share the available cash in this ratio. After paying off creditors and A's loan, the available amount will be distributed as \\nbelow in this method: \\n➢The third installment totals ₹900, with B paying ₹600 and C contributing \\n₹300, while A has no payment recorded. ➢The fourth installment is split into two parts: \\n✓\\nFor the first part, ₹3,600 in total with A contributing ₹2,400, B \\n₹960, and C ₹1,200. ✓\\nFor the second part, ₹2,400 in total with A, B, and C each paying \\n₹960, ₹960, and ₹480 respectively. ➢The fifth installment amounts to ₹20,100, with A, B, and C contributing \\n₹8,040 each. ➢The total amount comes to ₹27,000, with A's contribution being ₹9,000, \\nB's ₹12,000, and C's ₹6,000. ➢Total payment made to each partner will, of course be same under both \\nthe methods. 6.8.WINDING UP OF A LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP (LLP) \\nThe winding up of a LLP may be either voluntary or by the Tribunal and LLP, so \\nwound up may be dissolved. Winding up of a LLP may be initiated by Tribunal if: \\n•\\n The LLP wishes to wind up; \\n•\\n The LLP has less than 2 partners for more than 6 months; \\n•\\n The LLP is unable to pay its debts; \\n•\\n The LLP has not acted in the interest of the sovereignty and the integrity \\nof      India; \\n•\\n The LLP has failed to submit with the statements of accounts and \\nsolvency or the LLP annual returns for more than five consecutive \\nfinancial years with the Registrar; \\n₹3,000\\nB\\n₹1,500\\nC\\nB\\nC\\n•\\n The Tribunal thinks that it is Just and Equitable that the LLP should be \\nwound up.

To \\novercome this difficulty, the concept of 'Company' or 'Corporation' came into \\nexistence. While the invention of steam power ignited the human imagination to build big \\nmachines for the mass production of goods, the need to separate the \\nmanagement from ownership gave birth to a form of organisation today known as \\n'company'. Company form of organisation is one of the ingenious creations of human mind, \\nwhich has enabled the business to carry on its wealth creation activities through \\noptimum utilisation of resources. In course of time, a company structure has \\nbecome an important institutional form for business enterprise, which has carved \\nout a key place for itself in the field of business operations as well as in the \\nwealth-generating functions of society. 2.MEANING OF COMPANY \\nThe word 'Company', in everyday usage, implies an assemblage of persons for \\nsocial purpose, companionship or fellowship. As a form of organisation, the word \\n'company' implies a group of people who voluntarily agree to form a company. The word 'company' is derived from the Latin word 'com' i.e. with or together and \\n'panis' i.e.\"), Document(page_content='bread.'), Document(page_content='Originally the word referred to an association of persons or \\nmerchant men discussing matters and taking food together. However, in law \\n\\'company\\' is termed as company which is formed and incorporated under the \\nCompanies Act, 2013 or an existing company formed and registered under any of \\nthe previous company laws. As per this definition of law, there must be group of \\npersons who agree to form a company under the law and once so formed; it \\nbecomes a separate legal entity having perpetual succession with a distinct name \\nof its own and a common seal. Its existence is not affected by the change of \\nmembers. Company begs its origin in law. It is an organisation consisting of individuals, \\ncalled shareholders by virtue of holding the shares of a company, who are \\nauthorised by law to elect a board of directors and, through it, to act as a separate \\nlegal entity as regards its activities. Generally, the capital of the company consists \\nof transferable shares, and members have limited liabilities. To get to the heart of the nature of the company, let us examine the concept of \\ncompany propounded under corporate jurisprudence. According to Justice Marshal, \"A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, \\nintangible and existing only in the contemplation of law\". In the same manner, Lord Justice Hanay has defined a company as \"an artificial \\nperson created by law with a perpetual succession and a common seal\". A common thread running through the various definitions of \\'company\\' is that it \\nis an association of persons created by law as a separate body for a special \\npurpose. At the same time, definitions have laid down certain characteristics of a \\ncorporate organisation, which make it out as a separate and unique organisation \\nwhich enables the people to contribute their wealth to the capital of the company \\nby subscribing to its shares and appointing elected representatives to carry out \\nthe business. 3.SALIENT FEATURES OF A COMPANY \\nFollowing are the salient features of a company: \\n1. Incorporated Association: A company comes into existence through the \\noperation of law. Therefore, incorporation of company under the \\nCompanies Act is must. Without such registration, no company can come \\ninto existence. Being created by law, it is regarded as an artificial legal \\nperson. 2. Separate Legal Entity: A company has a separate legal entity and is not \\naffected by changes in its membership. Therefore, being a separate \\nbusiness entity, a company can contract, sue and be sued in its \\nincorporated name and capacity. 3. Perpetual Existence: Since company has existence independent of its \\nmembers, it continues to be in existence despite the death, insolvency or \\nchange of members. 4. Common Seal: Company is not a natural person; therefore, it cannot sign \\nthe documents in the manner as a natural person would do. In order to \\nenable the company to sign its documents, it is provided with a legal tool \\ncalled \\'Common Seal\\'. The common seal is affixed on all documents by the \\nperson authorised to do so who in turn puts his signature for and on behalf \\nof the company. Companies Act, 2013 required common seal to be affixed \\non certain documents (such as bill of exchange, share certificates, etc.) \\nNow, the use of common seal has been made optional. All such documents \\nwhich required affixing the common seal may now instead be signed by \\ntwo directors or one director and a company secretary of the company. Further, every company registered in India are required to obtain unique \\nCorporate Identification Number (CIN) that is assigned by Registrar of \\nCompanies.'), Document(page_content='5. Limited Liability: The liability of every shareholder of a company is limited \\nto the amount he has agreed to pay to the company on the shares allotted \\nto him. If such shares are fully paid-up, he is subject to no further liability.'), Document(page_content='6. Distinction between Ownership and Management: Since the number of \\nshareholders is very large and may be distributed at different geographical \\nlocations, it becomes difficult for them to carry on the operational \\nmanagement of the company on a dayto-day basis. This gives rise to the \\nneed of separation of the management and ownership.'), Document(page_content='7. Not a citizen: A company is not a citizen in the same sense as a natural \\nperson is, though it is created by the process of law. It has a legal existence \\nbut does not enjoy the citizenship rights and duties as are enjoyed by the \\nnatural citizens.'), Document(page_content='8. Transferability of Shares: The capital is contributed by the shareholders \\nthrough the subscription of shares. Such shares are transferable by its \\nmembers except in case of a private limited company, which may have \\ncertain restrictions on such transferability.'), Document(page_content='9. Maintenance of Books: A limited company is required by law to keep a \\nprescribed set of account books and any failure in this regard attracts \\npenalties. 10. Periodic Audit: A company has to get its accounts periodically audited \\nthrough the chartered accountants appointed for the purpose by the \\nshareholders on the recommendation of board of directors. 11. Right of Access to Information: The right of the shareholders of a company \\nto inspect its books of account, with the exception of books open for \\ninspection under the Statute, is governed by the Articles of Association. The shareholders have a right to seek information from the directors by \\nparticipating in the meetings of the company and through the periodic \\nreports. 4.TYPES OF COMPANIES \\n1.

Expenses include costs related to materials, purchases, changes in inventories, \\nemployee benefits, finance, depreciation and amortization, and other \\nmiscellaneous expenses. Total expenses are the aggregate of all individual expenses. Profit before exceptional and extraordinary items and tax is calculated by \\nsubtracting Total expenses from Total Revenue. Exceptional items are significant charges or credits that arise from events that are \\nnot considered part of the ordinary activities of the business. Profit before extraordinary items and tax is the profit calculated after considering \\nExceptional items. Extraordinary Items are events and transactions that are distinguished by their \\nsize or incidence. Profit before tax is the income before accounting for income taxes, which includes \\nboth Exceptional and Extraordinary items. Tax expense includes Current tax and Deferred tax charges for the period. Profit (Loss) for the period from continuing operations is the profit or loss after \\ntax expense but before extraordinary items.

UNIT - 2 ISSUE, FORFEITURE AND RE-ISSUE OF SHARES \\n2.1.INTRODUCTION \\nFunds provided by the owner(s) into a business are recorded as capital.'), Document(page_content='Capital of \\nthe business depends upon the form of business organisation.'), Document(page_content=\"Proprietor \\nprovides capital in a soleproprietorship business. In case of a partnership, there \\nis more than one proprietor, called partners. Partners introduce capital in a \\npartnership firm. As the maximum number of members in a partnership firm is \\nrestricted, therefore only limited capital can be provided in such form of \\nbusinesses. Moreover, the liability of the proprietor(s) is unlimited in case of \\nnoncorporate business, namely, sole-proprietorship and partnership. Capital funding process for different types of business forms can be summarised \\nas follows: \\n1. In a Sole Proprietorship, the business is owned by a single individual, the \\nproprietor, who contributes the capital and has unlimited liability, meaning \\npersonal assets can be used to cover business debts. 2. A Partnership is a business owned by multiple individuals, known as \\npartners, who provide the partners' capital and share unlimited liability for \\nbusiness obligations. 3. A Company is an entity owned by shareholders who contribute share \\ncapital; their liability is limited to the amount paid for their shares. With the onset of industrial revolution, requirement of capital investment soared \\nto a new height and the attached risk of failure increased due to pace of \\ntechnological developments. Non-corporate entities could not cope with the \\npressure of increased capital and degree of risk involved. This led to the \\nemergence of corporate form of organisation. 2.2.SHARE CAPITAL \\nTotal capital of the company is divided into a number of small indivisible units of \\na fixed amount and each such unit is called a share. The fixed value of a share, \\nprinted on the share certificate, is called nominal/par/face value of a share. However, a company can issue shares at a price different from the face value of a \\nshare. The liability of holder of shares (called shareholders) is limited to the issue \\nprice of shares acquired by them. Note: The issue price need not be equal to market price of the share.\"), Document(page_content=\"These days \\nthe shares are generally priced on the basis of book building process. (Book \\nbuilding is a process through which company determines it's share prices. Under \\nthis method company determines a price band of its shares and on the basis of \\nbids received from potential investors at various prices within the price band \\nfinally fixes its issue price.) \\nThe total capital of the company is divided into shares, the capital of the company \\nis called 'Share Capital'. At the time of issue of shares, every Company is required \\nto follow SEBI Regulations. Share capital of a company is divided into following categories: \\ni. Authorised Share Capital or Nominal Capital: A company estimates its \\nmaximum capital requirements. This amount of capital is mentioned in \\n'Capital Clause' of the 'Memorandum of Association' registered with the \\nRegistrar of Companies. It puts a limit on the amount of capital, which a \\ncompany is authorised to raise during its lifetime and is called 'Authorised \\nCapital'. It is shown in the Share Capital schedule in the financial statements \\nas per the prescribed format at face value. ii. Issued Share Capital: A company need not issue total authorised capital. Whatever portion of the share capital is issued by the company, it is called \\n'Issued Capital'. Issued capital means and includes the nominal value of \\nshares issued by the company for: \\n1. Cash, and \\n2.\"), Document(page_content='Consideration other than cash to: \\ni. Promoters of a company; and \\nii.'), Document(page_content='Others.'), Document(page_content=\"It is also presented in the balance sheet at nominal value. The remaining portion of the authorised capital which is not issued either in cash \\nor consideration may be termed as 'Un-issued Capital'. It is not shown in the \\nbalance sheet. iii.Subscribed Share Capital: It is that part of the issued share capital, which \\nis subscribed by the public i.e., applied by the public and allotted by the \\ncompany. It also includes the face value of shares issued by the company for \\nconsideration other than cash.\"), Document(page_content=\"iv. Called-up Share Capital: Companies generally receive the issue price of \\nshares in instalments. The portion of the issue price of shares which a \\ncompany has demanded or called from shareholders is known as 'Called-up \\nCapital' and the balance, which the company has decided to demand in future \\nmay be referred to as Uncalled Capital. v. Paid-up Share Capital: It is the portion of called up capital which is paid by \\nthe shareholders. Whenever a particular amount is called by the company \\nand the shareholder(s) fails to pay the amount fully or partially, it is known \\nas 'unpaid calls' or 'instalments (or Calls) in Arrears'. Thus, instalments in \\narrears mean the amount not paid although it has been demanded by the \\ncompany as payment towards the issue price of shares. To calculate paid-up \\ncapital, the amount of instalments in arrears is deducted from called up \\ncapital. Call-in-advance is that portion of capital which is yet to be called by the company \\nbut has already been paid by shareholder. In the financial statements, called-up and paid-up capital are shown together.\"), Document(page_content=\"vi. Reserve Share Capital: As per Section 65 of the Companies Act, 2013, a \\nCompany may decide by passing a resolution that a certain portion of its \\nsubscribed uncalled capital shall not be called up except in the event of \\nwinding up of the company. Portion of the uncalled capital which a company \\nhas decided to call only in case of liquidation of the company is called \\nReserve Capital. Reserve Capital is different from Capital reserve, Capital reserves are part of \\n'Reserves and Surplus' and refer to those reserves which are not available for \\ndeclaration of dividend. Thus, reserve capital which is portion of the uncalled \\ncapital to be called up in the event of winding up of the company is entirely \\ndifferent in nature from capital reserve which is created out of capital profits \\nonly. 1. Authorised Capital = Issued Capital + Unissued Capital. 2.

They also \\ncarry a preferential right over other shareholders to be paid first in case of \\nwinding up of the company.'), Document(page_content=\"Thus, they enjoy preferential rights in the matter of: \\na) Payment of dividend, and \\nb) Repayment of capital \\nGenerally, holders of these shares do not get voting rights. Companies use this \\nmode of financing as it is cheaper than raising debt. Dividend is generally \\ncumulative in nature and need not be paid every year in case of deficiency of \\nprofits. The Companies Act, 2013 prohibits the issue of any preference share \\nwhich is irredeemable. Preference shares are cumulative and non-participating \\nunless expressly stated otherwise. Types of Preference Shares \\nPreference shares can be of various types, which are as follows : \\na) Cumulative Preference Shares: A cumulative preference share is one \\nthat carries the right to a fixed amount of dividend or dividend at a fixed rate. Such a dividend is payable even out of future profit if current year's profits \\nare insufficient for the purpose. This means that dividend on these shares \\naccumulates unless it is paid in full and, therefore, the shares are called \\nCumulative Preference Shares. The companies are required to disclose the \\narrears of fixed cumulative dividends on preference shares separately in the \\n=\\nfinancial statement. In case, the dividend remains in arrears for a period of \\nnot less than two years, holders of such shares will be entitled to take part \\nand vote on every resolution on every matter in the general body meeting of \\nthe shareholders. b) Non-cumulative Preference Shares: A non-cumulative preference \\nshare carries with it the right to a fixed amount of dividend. In case no \\ndividend is declared in a year due to any reason, the right to receive such \\ndividend for that year expires. It implies that holder of such a share is not \\nentitled to arrears of dividend in future. c) Participating Preference Shares: Notwithstanding the right to a fixed \\ndividend, this category of preference share confers on the holder the right to \\nparticipate in the surplus profits, if any, after the equity shareholders have \\nbeen paid dividend at a stipulated rate. Similarly, in the event of winding up \\nof the company, this type of share carries the right to receive a pre-\\ndetermined proportion of surplus as well once the equity shareholders have \\nbeen paid off. d) Non-participating Preference Shares: A share on which only a fixed \\nrate of dividend is paid every year, without any accompanying additional \\nrights in profits and in the surplus on winding-up, is called 'Non-\\nparticipating Preference Shares.' Unless otherwise specified, the preference \\nshares are generally nonparticipating. Redeemable Preference Shares: These are shares that a company may issue \\non the condition that the company will repay after the fixed period or even \\nearlier at company's discretion. The repayment on these shares is called \\nredemption and is governed by Section 55 of the Companies Act, 2013. e) Non-redeemable Preference Shares: The preference shares, which \\ndo not carry with them the arrangement regarding redemption, are called \\nNonredeemable Preference Shares. According to Section 55, no company \\nlimited by shares shall issue irredeemable preference shares or preference \\nshares redeemable after the expiry of 20 years from the date of issue. However, a Company may issue preference shares redeemable after 20 years \\nfor such infrastructure projects as may be specified, under the Companies \\nAct, 2013. f) Convertible Preference Shares: These shares give the right to the \\nholder to get them converted into equity shares at their option according to \\nthe terms and conditions of their issue. g) Non-convertible Preference Shares: When the holder of a preference \\nshare has not been conferred the right to get his holding converted into \\nequity share, it is called Non-convertible Preference Shares. Preference \\nshares are nonconvertible unless otherwise stated. Note: Unless mentioned otherwise Preference Shares are Non-Cumulative, Non \\nParticipating, Non-Convertible and Redeemable in nature. (ii) Equity Shares: Equity shares are those shares, which are not preference \\nshares. It means that they do not enjoy any preferential rights in the matter of \\npayment of dividend or repayment of capital. The rate of dividend on equity \\nshares is recommended by the Board of Directors and may vary from year to year. Rate of dividend depends upon the dividend policy and the availability of profits \\nafter satisfying the rights of preference shareholders. These shares carry voting \\nrights. Companies Act, 2013 permits issue of equity share capital with differential \\nrights as to dividend, voting or otherwise in accordance with prescribed rules. The shares can be issued by a company either \\n1) for cash or \\n2) for consideration other than cash. 2.4.ISSUE OF SHARES FOR CASH \\nTo issue shares, private companies depend upon 'Private Placement' of shares. Public companies issue a 'Prospectus' and invite general public to subscribe for \\nshares. To discuss accounting treatment, we shall concentrate on public \\ncompanies who invite general public to subscribe for equity shares. Similar \\naccounting treatment is applicable in other cases. However, for journal entries in \\ncase of issue of preference shares, the word 'Equity' is replaced with the word \\n'Preference'. A public company issues a prospectus inviting general public to subscribe for its \\nshares. On the basis of prospectus, applications are deposited in a scheduled \\nbank by the interested parties along with the amount payable at the time of \\napplication, in cash. First instalment paid along with application is called \\n'Application Money'. As per Section 39 of the Companies Act, 2013. Application \\nmoney must be at least \\n of the nominal value of shares. After the closing date \\nof the issue (the last date for filing applications), company decides about \\nallotment of shares in consultation with the SEBI and stock exchange concerned. According to the Companies Act, 2013, a company cannot proceed to allot shares \\nunless minimum subscription is received by the company. Minimum Subscription: A public limited company cannot make any allotment of \\nshares unless the amount of minimum subscription stated in the prospectus has \\nbeen subscribed and the sum payable as application money for such shares has \\nbeen paid to and received by the company. The amount of minimum subscription \\nto be disclosed in prospectus by the Board of Directors taking into account the \\nfollowing: \\na) Preliminary expenses of the company, \\n5%\\nb) Commission payable on issue of shares, \\nc) Cost of fixed assets purchased or to be purchased, \\nd) Working capital requirements of the company, and \\ne) Any other expenditure for the day to day operation of the business. As per guidelines of the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the minimum \\nsubscription to be received in an issue shall not be less than ninety per cent of the \\noffer through offer document [Provided that in the case of an initial public offer, \\nthe minimum subscription to be received shall be subject to allotment of \\nminimum number of specified securities, as prescribed by Securities Contracts \\n(Regulation) Rules, 1957]. If the Company does not receive the minimum \\nsubscription of \\n of the issue, all application moneys received shall be \\nrefunded to the applicants forthwith, but not later than: \\n(a) fifteen days of the closure of the issue, in case of a non-underwritten issue; \\nand \\n(b) seventy days of the closure of the issue, in the case of an underwritten issue \\nwhere minimum subscription including devolvement obligations paid by the \\nunderwriters is not received within sixty days of the closure of the issue. The company reserves the right to reject or accept an application fully or \\npartially. Successful applicants become shareholders of the company and are \\nrequired to pay the second instalment which is known as 'Allotment Money' and \\nunsuccessful applicants get back their money. However, in case of delay in \\nrefunding the money, the Company becomes liable to pay interest on the amount \\nof refund. Subsequent instalments, if any, to be called by the company are known \\nas 'Calls'. As per Section 39 of the Companies Act, 2013, application money must be at least \\n of the face value of shares. However, as per SEBI Regulations, the minimum \\napplication moneys to be paid by an applicant along with the application money \\nshall not be less than \\n of the issue price. According to Section 24 of the \\nCompanies Act, 2013 matters related to issue and transfer of securities will be \\nadministered by the SEBI and not by the Company Law Board. The issue price of shares is generally received by the company in instalments and \\nthese instalments are known as under : \\nFirst instalment\\t\\n.

Whenever \\na company decides to issue shares to public, it invites applications for \\nsubscription by issuing a prospectus.'), Document(page_content='It is not necessary that company receives \\napplications for the number of shares to be issued by it. There are three \\npossibilities: \\n2.5.1.Full Subscription \\nIssue is fully subscribed if the number of shares offered for subscription and the \\nnumber of shares actually subscribed by the public are same. To start discussion \\non accounting treatment for issue of shares, let us assume that the issue is fully \\nsubscribed. 2.5.2.Under Subscription \\n(5)\\nIt means the number of shares offered for subscription is more than the number \\nof shares subscribed by the public. In this case, the journal entries as discussed \\nabove are passed but with one change i.e., calculation of application, allotment \\nand for that matter, the call money is based on number of shares actually applied \\nand allotted. It must be remembered that shares can be allotted, in this case, only \\nwhen the minimum subscription is received. 2.5.3.Over Subscription \\nIn actual practice, issue of shares is either under or over-subscribed. If an issue is \\noversubscribed, some applications may be rejected and application money \\nrefunded and in respect of others, only a part of the shares applied for may be \\nallotted and the excess amount received can be utilised towards allotment or call \\nmoney which has fallen due or will soon fall due for payment. The entries are: \\n1. On refund of application money to applicants to whom shares have not \\nbeen allotted: Share Application A/c Dr. To Bank Account \\n(Being application money refunded) \\n2. When only a part of shares applied for are allotted. Share Application A/C Dr. To Share Allotment \\n (With the application money accepted for allotment) \\nTo Share Calls-in-Advance* A/c \\nTo Bank A/c \\n(With the amount received in advance) \\n(With any excess amount to be refunded) \\n(Being application money adjusted) \\n Credited to Share Capital A/c subsequently. (Note: This type of share allotment is termed as Pro-rata allotment and has been \\ndiscussed in detail in para 2.8) \\n2.6.SHARES ISSUED AT DISCOUNT \\nShares are regarded to be issued at a discount, if issue is at an amount less than \\nthe nominal or par value of shares. The excess of the nominal value over the issue \\nprice represents discount on the issue of shares. For example, when a share of the \\n\\xa0∗\\xa0A/C\\xa0\\n\\xa0∗\\nnominal value of ₹ 100 is issued at ₹ 98 , it is said to have been issued at a \\ndiscount of 2 per cent. According to Section 53 of the Companies Act, 2013, a Company cannot issue \\nshares at a discount except in the case of issue of sweat equity shares (issued to \\nemployees and directors). Thus, any issue of shares at discount shall be void. 2.7.SHARES ISSUED AT PREMIUM \\nWhen a company issues its securities at a price more than the face value, it is said \\nto be an issue at a premium. Premium is the excess of issue price over face value \\nof the security. It is quite common for the financially strong, and well-managed \\ncompanies to issue their shares at a premium, i.e. at an amount more than the \\nnominal or par value of shares. Thus, where a share of the nominal value of ₹ 100 \\nis issued at ₹ 105, it is said to have been issued at a premium of 5 per cent. When the issue is at a premium, the amount of premium may technically be \\ncalled at any stage of share capital transactions. However, premium is generally \\ncalled with the amount due on allotment, sometimes with the application of \\nmoney and rarely with the call money. 2.7.1 Accounting Treatment \\nWhen shares are issued at a premium, the premium amount is credited to a \\nseparate account called \"Securities Premium Account\" because it is not a part of \\nshare capital. Rather, it represents a gain of a capital nature to the company. Being a credit balance, Securities premium Account is shown under the heading, \\n\"Reserves and Surplus\". However, \\'Reserves and Surplus\\' is shown as \\n\\'shareholders\\' funds in the Balance Sheet as per Schedule III. According to \\nSection 52 of the Companies Act, 2013, Securities Premium Account may be used \\nby the company: \\na. Towards issue of un-issued shares of the company to be issued to \\nmembers of the company as fully paid bonus securities.'), Document(page_content='b.'), Document(page_content='To write off preliminary expenses of the company. c. To write off the expenses of, or commission paid, or discount allowed on \\nany of the securities or debentures of the company. d. To provide for premium on the redemption of redeemable preference \\nshares or debentures of the company. e.'), Document(page_content=\"For the purchase of own shares or other securities. Note : It may be noted that certain class of Companies as prescribed under \\nSection 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, whose financial statements comply with \\nthe accounting standards prescribed for them (i.e. those companies to whom \\nIndian Accounting Standards are applicable), can't apply the securities premium \\naccount for the purposes (b) and (d) mentioned above.

It usually occurs in the case of good \\nissues and depends on many other factors like investors\\' confidence in the \\ncompany, general economic conditions, pricing of the issue etc. When the shares \\nare oversubscribed, the company cannot satisfy all the applicants. It means that a \\ndecision is to be made on how the shares are going to be allotted. Shares can be \\nallotted to the applicants by a company in any manner it thinks proper. The \\ncompany may reject some applicants in full, i.e., no shares are allotted to some \\napplicants and application money is refunded. Usually, multiple applications by \\nthe same persons are not considered. Allotment may be given to the rest of the \\napplicants in full, i.e., for the number of shares they have applied for. A third \\nalternative is that a company may allot shares to the applicants on pro-rata basis. \\'Pro-rata allotment\\' means allotment in proportion of shares applied for. For example, a company offers to the public 10,000 shares for subscription. The \\ncompany receives applications for 12,000 shares. If the shares are to be allotted \\non pro-rata basis, \\napplicants for 12,000 shares are to be allotted 10,000 shares, i.e., on the \\n or \\n ratio. Any applicant who has applied for 6 shares will be \\nallotted 5 shares. Under pro-rata allotment, the excess application money received is adjusted \\nagainst the amount due on allotment or calls. Surplus money after making \\nadjustment against future calls is returned to the applicants. The applicants are \\ninformed about the allotment procedure through an advertisement in leading \\nnewspapers. When there is a pro-rata allotment, the total application money paid by an \\napplicant is more than the exact amount due on application. The excess amount \\nA/c\\n12,000:10,000\\n6:5\\nis treated as an advance against allotment or any other future calls. The net \\namount due on allotment or any other calls is the difference between the amount \\ndue on allotment or any other calls and the excess amount received in \\napplication.

Share Calls Money Received in Full \\nWhen the full amount of the share calls is received, \"Bank A/C\" is debited with \\nthe full money received. This reflects the increase in the company\\'s bank account \\ndue to the collection of share calls. 2. Calls-in-Arrears (i.e., Money Received is Less Than Due) \\nIf the money received is less than the amount due, \"Calls-in-arrears A/C\" is \\ndebited with the entry for Bank A/C. This records the unpaid portion of the share \\ncall money as arrears. 3. Calls-in-Advance (i.e., Money of Future Instalments Received Beforehand) \\nWhen money is received in advance of the scheduled calls, \"Calls-in-advance A/\\nC\" is credited with entry for \"Bank A/C\". This represents the receipt of money \\nbefore it is actually due according to the instalment schedule. Calls-in-Arrears \\nSometimes shareholders fail to pay the amount due on allotment or calls. The \\ntotal unpaid amount on one or more instalments is known as Calls-in-Arrears or \\nUnpaid Calls. Such amount represents the uncollected amount of capital from the \\nshareholders; hence, it is shown by way of deduction from \\'called-up capital\\' to \\narrive at paid-up value of the share capital. For recording \\'Calls-in-Arrears\\', the following journal entry is recorded : \\nCalls-in-Arrears A/c Dr. [Amount of Unpaid Calls] \\nBank A/c \\nDr. [Amount received] \\nTo Share Allotment A/c \\nTo Share Calls A/c \\n[Total allotment money due] \\n[Total Call money due] \\n(Being call money/ allotment money received on .... shares at ₹.... per share.) \\nCalls-in-Advance \\nSome shareholders may sometimes pay a part, or whole, of the amount not yet \\ncalled up, such amount is known as Calls-in-advance. According to Table F, \\ninterest at a rate not exceeding 12 per cent p.a. is to be paid on such advance call \\nmoney.'), Document(page_content=\"This amount is credited in Calls-inAdvance Account. The following entry \\nis recorded: \\nBank A/c \\nDr. [Call amount received in advance] \\nTo Call-in-Advance A/c \\nWhen calls become actually due, calls-in-advance account is adjusted at the time \\nof the call. For this the following journal entry is recorded: \\nCalls-in-Advance A/c \\nDr. [Call amount received in advance] \\nBank A/c \\nTo Particular Call A/c \\nDr. [Remaining call money received, if any] \\n[Call money due] \\n(Being call in advance adjusted and call money due received) \\n2.10.INTEREST ON CALLS-IN-ARREARS AND CALLSIN-ADVANCE \\nInterest on calls in arrears is recoverable and that in respect of calls in advance is \\npayable, according to provisions in this regard in the articles of the company, at \\nthe rates mentioned therein or those to be fixed by the directors, within the limits \\nprescribed by the Articles. Table F prescribes \\n and \\n p.a. as the maximum \\nrates respectively for calls in arrears and those in advance. Interest on Calls in Arrears: \\nIt is an obligation of shareholders to remit to the company any due calls which \\nremain unpaid. As stipulated by Table F, the maximum interest rate that can be \\ncharged is 10%. The interest accrues from the date the call was due until payment \\nis received. Directors are vested with the discretion to waive this interest in \\nspecific cases. Such interest is treated as a nominal account and is recorded in the \\nstatement of profit and loss as income. Interest on Calls in Advance: \\nThis represents the company's obligation to pay interest to shareholders for call \\nmoney received before it is due. According to Table F, the prescribed maximum \\ninterest rate for such advances is 12%. The interest period commences from the \\ndate call money is received until the call is due. Shareholders, however, are not \\nentitled to any dividend on these advances. The interest paid is considered an \\nexpense for the company and is accounted for as a nominal account. The book entries to be passed for the adjustment of such interest are much the \\nsame as those in case of temporary borrowings or loans raised, the only \\ndifference being that debits are raised and credits are given to Sundry Members \\nAccount (and not the individual accounts of shareholders) in respect of interest \\nrecoverable on calls in arrear or that payable on call received in advance, the \\ncorresponding entries being made in the Interest Receivable on Calls in Arrears \\nand Interest Payable on Calls in Advance, respectively. The journal entries for calls-in-arrears are as follows : \\ni.

It is very common that one or more shareholders fail to pay their \\nallotment and/or calls on the due dates. Failure to pay call money results in \\nforfeiture of shares. Forfeiture of shares is the action taken by a company to \\ncancel the shares. The directors are usually empowered by the Articles of \\nAssociation to forfeit those shares by serving proper notice to the defaulting \\nshareholder(s). When shares are forfeited, the title of such shareholder is \\nextinguished but the amount paid to date is not refunded to him. The shareholder \\nthen has no further claim on the company. The power of forfeiture must be \\nexercised strictly having regard to the rules and regulations provided in the \\nArticles of Association and it should be bonafide in the interests of the company. The Articles of a company usually authorise the Directors to forfeit shares of a \\nmember on account of non-payment of a call or interest thereon after serving him \\na prior notice as prescribed by the Articles. Directors also have the right to cancel \\nsuch forfeiture before the forfeited shares are re-allotted. Accounting Entries \\nA /C\\nAt the time of passing entry for forfeiture of shares, students must be careful \\nabout the following matters: \\ni. Amount called-up (i.e., amount credited to capital) in respect of forfeited \\nshares.\"), Document(page_content='ii.'), Document(page_content='Amount already received in respect of those shares. iii.Amount due but has not been received in respect of those shares. We know that shares can be issued at par or at a premium. Accounting entries for \\nforfeiture will vary according to situations. 2.11.1.Forfeiture of Shares which were issued at Par \\nIn this case, Share Capital Account will be debited with the called-up value of \\nshares forfeited. Allotment or Calls Account will be credited with the amount due \\nbut not paid by the shareholder(s). (Alternatively, Calls-in-Arrears Account can \\nbe credited for all amount due, if it was transferred to Calls-in-Arrears Account).

If the premium on such shares has not been paid by the \\nshareholder, the Securities Premium Account will be debited to cancel it (if it was \\ncredited earlier). Allotment, Calls and Forfeited Accounts will be credited in the \\nusual manner. If the premium has already received by the company, it cannot be \\ncancelled even if the shares are forfeited in the future.

But fully paid-up shares may be forfeited for realization of debts of the \\nshareholder if the Articles specifically provide it. 2.12.RE-ISSUE OF FORFEITED SHARES \\nA forfeited share is merely a share available to the company for sale and remains \\nvested in the company for that purpose only. Reissue of forfeited shares is not \\nallotment of shares but only a sale. The share, after forfeiture, in the hands of the company is subject to an obligation \\nto dispose it off. In practice, forfeited shares are disposed off by auction. These \\nshares can be re-issued at any price so long as the total amount received (from \\nthe original allottee and the second purchaser) for those shares is not less than \\nthe amount in arrear on those shares. Accounting Entries : \\na) Bank Account Dr. [Actual amount received] \\nForfeited Shares Account Dr. [Loss on re-issue] \\n \\nTo Share Capital Account \\n(Being the re-issue of....shares @ ₹ .... each as per Board\\'s Resolution No.... dated.) \\nb) Forfeited Shares Account Dr. To Capital Reserve Account \\n(Being the profit on re-issue, transferred to capital reserve). 2.12.1.Points for Consideration \\nIn connection with re-issue, the following points are important: \\n1. Loss on re-issue should not exceed the forfeited amount. 2. If the loss on re-issue is less than the amount forfeited, the surplus should \\nbe transferred to Capital Reserve. 3. The forfeited amount on shares (amount originally paid-up) not yet \\nreissued should be shown under the heading \\'share capital.\\' \\n4. When only a portion of the forfeited shares are re-issued, then the profit \\nmade on reissue of such portion of shares only must be transferred to \\nCapital Reserve. 5. When the shares are re-issued at a loss, such loss is to be debited to \\n\"Forfeited Shares Account\". 6. If the shares are re-issued at a price which is more than the face value of \\nthe shares, the excess amount will be credited to Securities Premium \\nAccount. 7. If the re-issued amount and forfeited amount (taken together) exceeds the \\nface value of the shares re-issued, it is not necessary to transfer such \\namount to Securities Premium Account. 2.12.2.Calculation of Profit on Re-Issue of Forfeited Shares \\nStudents will appreciate that the credit balance of forfeited shares account cannot \\nbe considered a surplus until the shares forfeited have been re-issued, because \\nthe company may, on re-issue, allow the discount to the new purchaser \\nequivalent to the amount held in credit in this regard in the forfeited shares \\nAccount. Suppose 120 shares of a nominal value of ₹ 10 have been forfeited upon \\nwhich ₹ 5 per share was paid up and transferred to Forfeited Share Account. Afterwards, 50 shares are re-issued, ₹ 6 per share being collected to make them \\nfully paid up; ₹ 200 ( 50 shares  ₹ 10- 50 shares  ₹ 6) out of shares forfeited \\nwill be credited to Share Capital Account to make up the deficiency on re-issued \\nshares, and ₹ 50 (50 shares \\n ₹ 5 - ₹ 200) will be transferred to the Capital \\nReserve Account being the surplus on re-issue of the 50 shares. It would have in \\nthe Forfeited shares Account balance equivalent to the amount collected on the \\nremaining 70 forfeited shares i.e. ₹ 350 which will be carried forward till these \\nare re-issued. In the above case, it has been assumed that the amount paid up on all the 120 \\nforfeited shares was ₹ 5 per share. But in practice, shares may be forfeited on \\nwhich varying amounts are outstanding. For instance, if in the above case 70 \\nx\\nx\\nx\\nshares were forfeited with ₹ 5 paid up thereon and 50 shares with \\n was paid \\nup thereon then: \\nShare Forfeited Account Balance \\n \\n \\nThus if 50 shares with \\n paid up are re-issued for ₹ 6 per share then Capital \\nReserve balance will be as follows: \\n shares \\n \\n2.13.ISSUE OF SHARES FOR CONSIDERATION OTHER THAN CASH \\nPublic limited companies, generally, issue their shares for cash and use such cash \\nto buy the various types of assets needed in the business. Sometimes, however, a \\ncompany may issue shares in a direct exchange for land, buildings or other assets.'), Document(page_content=\"Shares may also be issued in payment for services rendered by promoters, \\nlawyers in the formation of the company. These shares should be shown \\nseparately under the heading 'Share Capital'. Within specified time of allotment, the company must produce before the \\nRegistrar a written contract of sale of service in respect of which shares have been \\nallotted. Under accounting standards, if an asset is acquired, or partly acquired, by the \\nissue of shares or other securities, the acquisition cost is the fair value of the \\nsecurities issued (which, in appropriate cases, may be indicated by the issue price \\nas determined by statutory authorities).

But with increasing \\nand evergrowing needs of the corporate expansion and growth, equity source of \\nfinancing is not sufficient.\"), Document(page_content='Hence corporates turn to debt financing through \\nvarious means. Issuing debt instruments by offering the same for public \\nsubscription is one of the sources of financing the business activities. Debt \\nfinancing does not only helps in reducing the cost of the capital but also helps in \\ndesigning appropriate capital structure of the company. Debenture is one of the \\nmost commonly used debt instrument issued by the company to raise funds for \\nthe business. 3.2.MEANING \\nThe most common method of supplementing the capital available to a company is \\nto issue debentures which may either be simple or naked carrying no charge on \\nassets, or mortgage debentures carrying either a fixed or a floating charge on \\nsome or all of the assets of the company. A debenture is a bond issued by a company under its seal, acknowledging a debt \\nand containing provisions as regards repayment of the principal and interest.'), Document(page_content='If a \\ncharge* has been created on any or on the entire assets of the company, the \\nnature of the charge and the assets charged are described therein. Since the \\ncharge is not valid unless registered with the Registrar, and the certificate \\nregistering the charge is printed on the bond. It is also customary to create a \\ntrusteeship in favour of one or more persons in the case of mortgage debentures. The trustees of debenture holders have all powers of a mortgage of a property and \\ncan act in whatever way they think necessary to safeguard the interest of \\ndebenture holders. Section 2 (30) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines debentures as \"Debenture\" \\nincludes debenture stock, bonds or any other instrument of a company \\nevidencing a debt, whether constituting a charge on the assets of the company or \\nnot. Thus, It is clear from definition that debenture may be Secured Debenture or \\nUnsecured Debenture. Note: No company shall issue any debentures carrying any voting rights. 3.3.FEATURES OF DEBENTURES \\n1. It is a document which evidences a loan made to a company.'), Document(page_content='2.

Debenture holders have no voting rights and consequently do not pose any \\nthreat to the existing control of the company. 3. Debenture interest is generally paid at a pre-determined fixed rate. It is \\npayable, whether there is any profit or not. Debentures rank ahead of all \\ntypes of shares for payment of the interest due on them. 4. Interest on debentures are the charges against profits and they are \\ndeductible as an expense in determining taxable profit of the company. 5.

Security \\na) Secured Debentures: These debentures are secured by a charge upon some \\nor all assets of the company. There are two types of charges: (i) Fixed charge; \\nand (ii) Floating charge. A fixed charge is a mortgage on specific assets. These \\nassets cannot be sold without the consent of the debenture holders. The sale \\nproceeds of these assets are utilized first for repaying debenture holders. A \\nfloating charge generally covers all the assets of the company including future \\none. b) Unsecured or \"Naked\" Debentures: These debentures are not secured by \\nany charge upon any assets. A company merely promises to pay interest on \\ndue dates and to repay the amount due on maturity date. These types of \\ndebentures are very risky from the view point of investors.'), Document(page_content='2. Convertibility \\na) Convertible Debentures: These are debentures which will be converted \\ninto equity shares (either at par or premium or discount) after a certain \\nperiod of time from the date of its issue. These debentures may be fully or \\npartly convertible. In future, these debenture holders get a chance to become \\nthe shareholders of the company. b) Non-Convertible Debentures: These are debentures which cannot be \\nconverted into shares in future. As per the terms of issue, these debentures \\nare repaid.'), Document(page_content='3. Permanence \\na) Redeemable Debentures: These debentures are repayable as per the terms \\nof issue, for example, after 8 years from the date of issue. b) Irredeemable Debentures: These debentures are not repayable during the \\nlife time of the company. These are also called perpetual debentures. These \\nare repaid only at the time of liquidation. 4. Negotiability \\na) Registered Debentures: These debentures are payable to a registered \\nholder whose name, address and particulars of holding is recorded in the \\nRegister of Debenture holders. They are not easily transferable. The \\nprovisions of the Companies Act, 2013 are to be complied with for effecting \\ntransfer of these debentures. Debenture interest is paid either to the order of \\nregistered holder as expressed in the warrant issued by the company or the \\nbearer of the interest coupons. b) Bearer Debentures: These debentures are transferable by delivery. These \\nare negotiable instruments payable to the bearer. No kind of record is kept by \\nthe company in respect of the holders of such debentures. Therefore, the \\ninterest on it is paid to the holder irrespective of any identity. No transfer \\ndeed is required for transfer of such debentures.'), Document(page_content='5. Priority \\na) First Mortgage Debentures: These debentures are payable first out of the \\nproperty charged. b) Second Mortgage Debentures: These debentures are payable after \\nsatisfying the first mortgage debentures. 3.6.ISSUE OF DEBENTURES \\n3.6.1.Accounting entries for issue of redeemable debentures \\nThe issue of redeemable debentures can be categorized into the following: \\n1. Debentures issued at a par and redeemable at par or at a discount; \\n2.'), Document(page_content='Debentures issued at a discount and redeemable at par or at discount; \\n3. Debentures issued at premium and redeemable at par or at discount; \\n4. Debentures issued at par and redeemable at premium; \\n5. Debentures issued at a discount and redeemable at premium. 6. Debentures issued at premium and redeemable at premium. Note: Redemption at a discount may be a rare circumstance in practical life. Journal entries in each of the above cases are discussed below: \\n1. Debentures issued at par redeemable at par: When debenture are \\nissued at par, the issue price is equal to par value, in this regard the \\nfollowing entries are recorded: \\na) For receipt of application money : \\nBank A/c   Dr. To Debenture Application A/c \\nb) For transfer of application money to debentures account : \\nDebenture Application A/c     Dr. To ...% Debenture A/c \\n3.6.2.Accounting for issue of debentures payable in instalments \\nJust like shares, money payable on debentures may be paid either in full with \\napplication or by instalments. Accounting entries will differ to some extent in \\neither case. 3.6.2.1.Debentures Payable in Full on Application \\nWhere the amount due on debentures are payable in full on application, it is \\nusual to open a separate Debentures Application Account for each class of \\ndebentures, such as \\n Debentures Application Account or \\n Debentures \\nApplication Account. These accounts record moneys received from the applicants \\nof debentures. If an issue is over-subscribed, these accounts can be used to record \\nthe refund of moneys to the unsuccessful applicants. At the time of allotment of \\ndebentures, the amount in Debentures Application Account is transferred to the \\nrespective Debentures Account. As discussed above, debentures may be issued at par, at a premium, or at a \\ndiscount. 3.6.2.2.Debentures Issued at Par \\nThe debentures which are issued at par are issued at the same price as their \\nnominal value; that is, if a debenture with a nominal value of ₹ 100 is issued at \\npar, the company receives ₹ 100. The accounting entries would be as follows: \\n10%\\n12%\\na) When cash is received \\nBank A/c                              Dr.'), Document(page_content=\"To Debentures Application A/C \\n(Being money received on.... debentures @₹ ....each) \\nb) When excess money is refunded or adjusted for future calls \\nDebentures Application A/c                        Dr. To Bank A/c (Amount refunded) \\nTo Debenture Allotment A/c (Amount adjusted for allotment) \\n(Being excess money...debentures adjusted as per Board's Resolution \\nNo....dated.....) \\nc) When the debentures are allotted \\nDebentures Application A/c Dr. To % Debentures A/C \\n(Being the allotment of...debentures of ₹ ....each as per Board's Resolution \\nNo....dated....) \\nd) On Allotment money being called \\nDebenture Allotment A/c                   Dr. To % Debentures A/c \\n(Being Allotment Money Called) \\ne) On Allotment money being received \\nBank A/c Dr. To Debenture Allotment A/C \\n(Being Allotment money received) \\nf) On Debenture Call money being called \\nDebenture Calls A/c Dr. To % Debentures A/C \\n(Being Call money made due) \\ng) On Debenture Call money being called \\nBank A/c Dr. To Debenture Calls A/c \\n(Being Call money received) \\n3.6.2.3.Debentures Issued at a Premium \\nA company issues debentures at a premium when the market rate of interest is \\nlower than the debentures interest rate. The debentures, which are issued at a \\npremium, are issued at a higher price than their nominal value; that is, if a \\ndebenture with a nominal value of \\n is issued at \\n premium, the company \\nreceives at \\n where the investor gets slightly less interest than stated in the \\ndebenture. For example, \\n Debentures of ₹ 100 issued at a premium of \\n. The investor will get ₹12 p.a.\"), Document(page_content='for his investment of 110 .'), Document(page_content='Therefore, the effective \\nrate of interest on investment is \\n. The premium on debentures is credited to \\'Securities Premium \\nAccount\\' as \\'Debentures\\' are covered in the definition of \\'securities\\' \\nspecified in the clause (h) of section 2 of the Securities Contracts \\n(Regulation) Act. Therefore, restriction of utilization of debentures \\n(securities) premium will also be governed by Section 52 of the \\nCompanies Act, 2013. The accounting entries would be as follows: \\na) When cash is received \\nBank A/c                         Dr. [Nominal value plus premium] \\nTo Debentures Application A/C \\n(Being money received on....debentures @ ₹ ..... each including premium of ₹ .....) \\nb) When excess money is refunded \\nDebentures Application A/c Dr. To Bank A/c \\n(Being refund of money on....debentures @ ₹ .... each, as per Board\\'s Resolution \\nNo.....dated....) \\n₹100\\n10%\\n₹110\\n12%\\n10%\\n(12/110x100) = 10.91%\\nc) When the debentures are allotted \\nDebentures Application A/c               Dr. To % Debentures A/C \\nTo Securities Premium A/c \\n(Being the allotment of....debentures, premium \\ntransferred to Securities Premium A/c, \\nas per Board\\'s Resolution No....dated....) \\n3.6.2.4.Debentures Issued at a Discount \\nThe Companies Act does not impose any restriction on the price at which \\ndebentures can be issued. Unlike shares, there is no limit for discount on issue of \\ndebentures. This is why it is very common for debentures to be issued at a \\ndiscount. The debentures which are issued at a discount are issued at a lower \\nprice than nominal value, that is, if a debenture with a nominal value of ₹100 is \\nissued at \\n discount, the company receives ₹90 only. The issue of debentures \\nat a discount slightly increases the true rate of interest payable. For example, \\n \\nDebentures of ₹100 issued at a discount of \\n. The Company will have to pay \\n₹12 for a loan of ₹90. Therefore, the true rate of interest is \\n. The company issues debentures at a discount when the market rate of interest is \\nhigher than the debenture interest rate. Like shares, Debentures Account is \\ncredited with the nominal value. The difference between the nominal value of \\ndebentures and cash received is transferred to \"Discount on Issue of Debentures \\nAccount. In the subsequent years, Discount on Issue of Debentures is written-off \\nproportionately by charging to the Statement of Profit and Loss. It is considered a \\nnormal practice to amortize discount on issue of debentures over the period of \\nbenefit, i.e., normally 3 to 5 years. However, this cannot go beyond tenure of \\ndebentures.'), Document(page_content=\"The accounting entries would be as follows : \\na) When Cash is received \\nBank A/c Dr. [Actual cash received] \\nTo Debentures Application A/c \\n(Being money received on....debentures @₹ ......each) \\nb) When excess money is refunded \\n10%\\n12%\\n10%\\n(12/90 × 100) = 13.33%\\nDebentures Application A/c                    Dr. To Bank A/c \\n(Being excess money on...debentures refunded as per \\nBoard's Resolution No.....dated....) \\nc) When the debentures are allotted \\nDebentures Application A/c Dr. [Actual cash received] \\nDiscount on Issue of Debentures A/c \\nTo% Debentures A/c                  Dr. [Discount on debentures][Nominal value of \\ndebentures] \\n(Being the allotment of...debentures of ₹ ....each \\n@ ₹ .....each as per Board's Resolution No.....dated...) \\nIn fact, the discount on issue of debentures is considered as incremental interest \\nexpense. The true expense (net borrowing cost) for a particular accounting period \\nis, therefore, the total interest payment plus the discount amortised. 3.7.ISSUE OF DEBENTURES AS COLLATERAL SECURITY \\nCollateral security means secondary or supporting security for a loan, which can \\nbe realised by the lender in the event of the original loan not being repaid on the \\ndue date. Under this arrangement, the borrower agrees that a particular asset or a \\ngroup of assets will be realized and the proceeds there from will be applied to \\nrepay the loan in the event that the amount due, cannot be paid. Sometimes companies issue their own debentures as collateral security for a loan \\nor a fluctuating overdraft. When the loan is repaid on the due date, these \\ndebentures are at once released with the main security. In case, the company \\ncannot repay its loan and the interest thereon on the due date, the lender \\nbecomes the debenture holder who can exercise all the rights of a debenture \\nholder. In such cases, the holder of such debentures is entitled to interest \\nonly on the amount of loan, but not on the debentures. Accounting Entries \\nThere are two methods of showing these types of debentures in the accounts of a \\ncompany. Method 1 \\nUnder this method, no entry is made in the books of account of the company at \\nthe time of making issue of such debentures. In the 'Notes to Accounts' of Balance \\nSheet, the fact of the debentures being issued and outstanding is shown by a note \\nunder the liability secured. Method 2 \\nUnder this method, the following entry is made to record the issue of such \\ndebentures: \\nDebentures Suspense Account Dr. To % Debentures Account \\n(Being the issue of...debentures collaterally as per \\nBoard's Resolution No.....dated......) \\nThe Debentures Suspense Account will appear on the assets side of the Balance \\nSheet under Other Non- Current Assets and Debentures on the liabilities side of \\nthe Balance Sheet. When the loan is repaid, the entry is reversed in order to \\ncancel it. 3.8.ISSUE OF DEBENTURES IN CONSIDERATION OTHER THAN FOR \\nCASH \\nJust like shares, debentures can also be issued for consideration other than for \\ncash, such as for purchase of land, machinery, etc. In this case, the following \\nentries are passed: \\na) Sundry Assets Account Dr. [Assets taken over] \\nTo Sundry Liabilities Account[Liabilities assumed] \\nTo Vendors Account [Purchase consideration] \\n \\n (Being the assets and liabilities taken over) \\nb) Vendors Account   Dr. To Debentures Account \\n(Being the issue of....debentures to satisfy purchase consideration) \\nFurther it should be noted that these debentures can be issued at par, premium \\nand at discount. In each case the second entry for issue of debentures would be \\ndone accordingly. Number of debentures to be issued is calculated as follows:- \\n1. When debentures are issued at par \\n \\n2.\"), Document(page_content=\"When debentures are issued at premium \\n \\n3. When debentures are issued at discount \\n \\n3.9.TREATMENT OF DISCOUNT/LOSS ON ISSUE OF DEBENTURES \\nThe discount on issue of debentures is amortised over a period between the \\nissuance date and redemption date. It should be written-off in the following \\nmanner depending upon the terms of redemption: \\na) If the debentures are redeemable after a certain period of time, say at the \\nend of 5 years, the total amount of discount should be written-off equally \\nthroughout the life of the debentures (applying the straight line method). The \\nmain advantage of this method is that it spreads the burden of discount \\nequally over the years. b) If the debentures are redeemable at different dates, the total amount of \\ndiscount should be written-off in the ratio of benefit derived from debenture \\nloan in any particular year (applying the sum of the year's digit method). This \\nmethod is suitable when debentures are redeemed by unequal instalments. The accounting entries would be as follows : \\nProfit and Loss Account \\nDr. To Discount on Issue of Debentures Account \\n(Being the amount of discount on issue of debentures written-off) \\n\\xa0No. of\\xa0Shares\\xa0=\\n\\xa0Purchase\\xa0Consideration\\xa0\\n\\xa0Par\\xa0Value\\xa0\\n\\xa0No. of\\xa0Shares\\xa0=\\n\\xa0Purchase\\xa0Consideration\\xa0\\n\\xa0Par\\xa0Value\\xa0+\\xa0Premium\\xa0\\n\\xa0No. of\\xa0Shares\\xa0=\\n\\xa0Purchase\\xa0Consideration\\xa0\\n\\xa0Par\\xa0Value\\xa0−\\xa0Discount\\xa0\\nLoss on issue of debentures is also a capital loss and should be written off in a \\nsimilar manner as discount on debentures issued. In the balance sheet both the \\nitems (Discount and Loss) are shown as Non-current/current assets depending \\nupon the period for which it has to be written off. 3.10.INTEREST ON DEBENTURES \\nInterest payable on coupon debenture is treated as a charge against the profits of \\nthe company. Interest on debenture is paid periodically and is calculated at \\ncoupon rate on the nominal value of debentures. The company will pay interest \\nnet of tax to the debenture holders because the company is under obligation to \\ndeduct tax at source at the rates applicable under tax rules from time to time. The \\ncompanies will deposit the tax so deducted with income tax authorities. Following accounting entries are to be recorded in this regard: \\n1.

In other words, no new funds are raised with a bonus \\nissue.'), Document(page_content=\"While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued \\nand owned, it does not increase the net worth of the company. Although the total \\nnumber of issued shares increases, the ratio of number of shares held by each \\nshareholder remains constant. Bonus issue is also known as 'capitalisation of profits'. Capitalisation of profits \\nrefers to the process of converting profits or reserves into paid up capital. A \\ncompany may capitalise its profits or reserves which otherwise are available for \\ndistribution as dividends among the members by issuing fully paid bonus shares \\nto the members. If the subscribed and paid-up capital exceeds the authorised share capital as a \\nresult of bonus issue, a resolution shall be passed by the company at its general \\nbody meeting for increasing the authorised capital. A return of bonus issue along \\nwith a copy of resolution authorising the issue of bonus shares is also required to \\nbe filed with the Registrar of Companies. Bonus shares are shares issued at no cost to current shareholders in a company.\"), Document(page_content=\"The allocation of bonus shares is based upon the number of shares that the \\nshareholder already owns. This succinctly describes the nature of bonus shares and the basis for their \\ndistribution among existing shareholders. 4.1.2.Provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 \\nSection 63 of the Companies Act, 2013 deals with the issue of bonus shares. According to Sub-section (1) of Section 63, a company may issue fully paid-up \\nbonus shares to its members, in any manner whatsoever, out of- \\ni. its free reserves*; \\nii. the securities premium account; or \\niii.the capital redemption reserve account: \\nProvided that no issue of bonus shares shall be made by capitalising reserves \\ncreated by the revaluation of assets. Sub-section (2) of Section 63 provides that no company shall capitalise its profits \\nor reserves for the purpose of issuing fully paid-up bonus shares under sub-\\nsection (1), unless-  \\na) it is authorised by its articles; \\nb) it has, on the recommendation of the Board, been authorised in the \\ngeneral meeting of the company; \\nc) it has not defaulted in payment of interest or principal in respect of fixed \\ndeposits or debt securities issued by it; \\nd) it has not defaulted in respect of the payment of statutory dues of the \\nemployees, such as, contribution to provident fund, gratuity and bonus; \\ne) the partly paid-up shares, if any outstanding on the date of allotment, are \\nmade fully paid-up. f) it complies with such conditions as may be prescribed. The company which has once announced the decision of its Board recommending \\na bonus issue, shall not subsequently withdraw the same. Sub-section (3) of the Section also provides that the bonus shares shall not be \\nissued in lieu of dividend. As per Para 39 (i) of Table F under Schedule I to the Companies Act, 2013, a \\ncompany in general meeting may, upon the recommendation of the Board, \\nresolve- \\ni. a) that it is desirable to capitalise any part of the amount for the time being \\nstanding to the credit of any of the company's reserve accounts, or to the \\ncredit of the profit and loss account, or otherwise available for distribution; \\nand \\nb) that such sum be accordingly set free for distribution in the specified \\nmanner amongst the members who would have been entitled thereto, if \\ndistributed by way of dividend and in the same proportions. ii. The sum aforesaid shall not be paid in cash but shall be applied, subject to \\nthe provision contained in clause (iii), either in or towards - (a) paying up any \\namounts for the time being unpaid on any shares held by such members \\nrespectively; (b) paying up in full, unissued shares of the company to be \\nallotted and distributed, credited as fully paid-up, to and amongst such \\nmembers in the proportions aforesaid; partly in the way specified in (a) and \\npartly in that specified in (b) above; \\nA securities premium account and a capital redemption reserve account may only \\nbe applied in the paying up of unissued shares to be issued to members of the \\ncompany as fully paid bonus shares. In other words, securities premium account \\nand capital redemption reserve cannot be applied towards payment of unpaid \\namount on any shares held by existing shareholders. As per Section 63(2) of the Companies Act, 2013, bonus shares cannot be issued \\nunless party paid-up shares are made fully paid-up. Para 39(ii) of Table F under \\nSchedule I to the Companies Act, 2013 allows use of free reserves for paying up \\namounts unpaid on shares held by existing shareholders. On a combined reading of both the provisions, it can be said that free reserves \\nmay be used for paying up amounts unpaid on shares held by existing \\nshareholders (though securities premium account and capital redemption reserve \\ncannot be used). 4.1.3.Journal Entries \\nA.\"), Document(page_content='1.

These points outline the potential financial implications of corporate decisions \\nthat affect share capital and market perception. 4.2.RIGHT ISSUE \\n4.2.1.Introduction \\nProvisions of section 62(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 govern any company, \\npublic or private, which is desirous of raising its subscribed share capital by issue \\nof further shares. Whenever a company intends to issue new shares, the voting \\nand governance rights of the existing shareholders may be diluted, if they are not \\nallowed to preserve them. It may happen because new shareholders may \\nsubscribe to the issued share capital. Companies Act, 2013 allows existing \\nshareholders to preserve their position by offering those newly issued shares at \\nthe first instance to them. The existing shareholders are given a right to subscribe \\nthese shares, if they like. However, if they do not desire to subscribe these shares, \\nthey are even given the right to renounce it in favour of someone else (unless the \\narticles of the company prohibits such a right to renounce). The value of a right is calculated as the difference between the cum-right value of \\na share and the ex-right value of a share. Mathematically, it is expressed as: \\nValue of\\xa0right=Cum-right\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0share−Ex  \\nright\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0shareValue\\xa0of\\xa0right=Cum-right\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0share−Ex- \\nright\\xa0value\\xa0of\\xa0share \\nThis formula is used to determine the value of rights issued by a company to its \\nexisting shareholders, allowing them to purchase additional shares usually at a \\ndiscount. The \"cum-right\" value is the share price before the rights are issued \\n(including the value of the rights), while the \"ex-right\" value is the price of the \\nshare after the rights have been issued (excluding the value of the rights). In nutshell, the existing shareholders have a right to subscribe to any fresh issue \\nof shares by the company in proportion to their existing holding for shares.'), Document(page_content=\"They \\nhave an implicit right to renounce this right in favour of anyone else, or even \\nreject it completely. In other words, the existing shareholders have right of first \\nrefusal, i.e., the existing shareholders enjoy a right to either subscribe for these \\nshares or sell their rights or reject the offer. Exceptions to the rights of existing equity shareholders \\nSection 62 recognises four situations under which the further shares are to be \\nissued by a company, but they need not be offered to the existing shareholders. The shares can be offered, without being offered to the existing shareholders, \\nprovided the company has passed a special resolution and shares are offered \\naccordingly. Situation 1 \\nTo employees under a scheme of employees' stock option subject to certain \\nspecified conditions \\nSituation 2 \\nTo any persons, either for cash or for a consideration other than cash, if the price \\nof such shares is determined by the valuation report of a registered valuer subject \\nto certain specified conditions. Situation 3 \\nSometimes companies borrow money through debentures / loans and give their \\ncreditor an option to buy equity shares of a company. An option is a right, but not \\nan obligation, to buy equity shares on a future date (expiry date) at a price agreed \\nin advance (exercise price). According to Section 62(3), nothing in this section shall apply to the increase of \\nthe subscribed capital of a company caused by the exercise of an option as a term \\nattached to the debentures issued or loan raised by the company to convert such \\ndebentures or loans into shares in the company. Provided that the terms of issue of such debentures or loan containing such an \\noption have been approved before the issue of such debentures or the raising of \\nloan by a special resolution passed by the company in general meeting. Situation 4 \\nIt is a special situation where the loan has been obtained from the government, \\nand government in public interest, directs the debentures / loan to be converted \\ninto equity shares. According to Section 62(4), notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section \\n(3), where any debentures have been issued, or loan has been obtained from any \\nGovernment by a company, and if that Government considers it necessary in the \\npublic interest so to do, it may, by order, direct that such debentures or loans or \\nany part thereof shall be converted into shares in the company on such terms and \\nconditions as appear to the Government to be reasonable in the circumstances of \\nthe case even if terms of the issue of such debentures or the raising of such loans \\ndo not include a term for providing for an option for such conversion. Financial effects of a further issue \\nThe financial position of a business is contained in the balance sheet. Further \\nissue of shares increase the amount of equity (net worth) \\n as well as the liquid \\nresources (Bank). The amount of equity is the product of further number of \\nshares issued multiplied by issue price. The issue price may be higher than the \\nface value (issue at a premium). Companies Act does not allow issue of shares at a \\ndiscount, except issue of sweat equity shares under Section 53. Book Value of a share \\nBook value of a share  Net worth (as per books)/ Number of shares \\nif there are 10,000 shares with net worth of \\n. The book value of one \\nshare is ( \\n / 10,000 shares) ₹ 12.50 per share. However, the market \\nvalue may differ from the book value of shares. The market value of a company's \\nshares represents the present value of future cash flows expected to be earned \\nfrom the share in the form of dividends and capital gains from expected future \\nshare price appreciation. The market price, which exists before the rights issue, is termed as Cum-right \\nMarket Price of the share. If the company decides to issue further shares, it may \\naffect the market value of the share. 'Theoretically', the value of a company's \\nshares after a rights issue must equal the sum of market capitalisation \\nimmediately prior to rights issue and the cash inflows generated from the rights \\nissue. Normally, the further public issue to the existing shareholders are offered at a \\ndiscounted price from the market value, to evoke positive response as well as to \\nreward the existing shareholders. Assume a company having a net worth of \\n shares are issued \\n(making it a right issue of 1:10; or 1 new share for 10 existing shares held) at a \\nprice of ₹ 14 per share. The existing worth of tangible assets held by the business \\nshall become 264,000 (Existing net worth ₹ 250,000 + Fresh Issue ₹ 14,000).

Shareholders \\nthat have received right shares have three choices of what to do with the rights. They can act on the rights and buy more shares as per the particulars of the rights \\nissue; they can sell them in the market; or they can pass on taking advantage of \\ntheir rights (i.e., reject the right offer). The renunciation of the right is valuable and can be monetised by the existing \\nshareholders in well-functioning capital market. The monetised value available to \\nthe existing shareholders due to right issue is known as 'value of right'. If a \\nshareholder decides to renounce all or any of the right shares in favour of his \\nnominee, the value of right is restricted to the sale price of the renouncement of a \\nright in favour of the nominee. In case the right issue offer is availed by an \\nexisting shareholder, the value of right is determined as given below: \\nValue of right  Cum-right value of share - Ex-right value of share \\nEx-right value of the shares \\n [Cum-right value of the existing shares + (Rights \\nshares  Issue Price)] / (Existing Number of shares + Number of right shares) \\nIn our previous example, Ex-right value of share \\n \\nshares \\n \\n shares \\n \\nValue of right \\n per share. 4.2.2.Accounting of Right issue \\nThe accounting treatment of rights share is the same as that of issue of ordinary \\nshares and the following journal entry will be made: \\nBank A/C\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nDr. To Equity shares capital A/c \\nIn case rights shares are being offered at a premium, the premium amount is \\ncredited to the securities premium account \\nThe accounting entry is usual and is \\nBank A/c\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nDr. To Equity Share Capital A/c \\nTo Securities Premium A/c \\n=\\n=\\nX\\n= [₹250,000 + (₹14 × 1,000\\n)]/10,000\\n+1,000\\n= ₹24\\n= ₹25 −₹24 = ₹1\\n4.2.3.Advantages and Disadvantages of Right Issue  \\nAdvantages of Right Issue \\n1.

It is a contract specifying the obligation to redeem preference shares \\nwithin or at the end of a given time period at an agreed price. These shares are \\nissued on the terms that shareholders will at a future date be repaid the amount \\nwhich they invested in the company (apart from the frequent payments of a \\nspecified amount of dividend as return on investment during the tenure of the \\npreference shares). The redemption date is the maturity date, which specifies \\nwhen repayment is scheduled to take place and is usually printed on the \\npreference share certificate. Through the process of redemption, a company can \\nalso adjust its financial structure, for example, by eliminating preference shares \\nand replacing those with other securities if future growth of the company makes \\nsuch change advantageous. 5.2.PURPOSE OF ISSUING REDEEMABLE PREFERENCE SHARES \\nA company may issue redeemable preference shares because of the following: \\n1. It is a proper way of raising finance in a dull primary market.\"), Document(page_content=\"2. A company may face difficulty in raising share capital, as its shares are not \\ntraded on the stock exchange. Potential investors who may, hesitate in putting \\nmoney into shares that cannot easily be sold may be encouraged to invest if \\nthe shares are redeemable by the company. 3. The preference shares may be redeemed when there is a surplus of capital and \\nthe surplus funds cannot be utilised in the business for profitable use. 4. No dividend is required to be paid, if there is loss or no profit, whereas \\ninterest is payable on debentures or loans even in case of loss. In other words, \\npreference dividend declared / paid continues to be regarded as an \\nappropriation of profits (similar treatment is given for equity shares), as \\nagainst interest on debentures, which is a charge against profits. In India, the issue and redemption of preference shares is governed by Section 55 \\nof the Companies Act, 2013. 5.3.PROVISIONS OF THE COMPANIES ACT (SECTION 55) \\nA company limited by shares if so authorised by its Articles, may issue preference \\nshares which at the option of the company, are liable to be redeemed within a \\nperiod, normally not exceeding 20 years from the date of their issue. It should be \\nnoted that: \\na) no shares can be redeemed except out of divisible or distributable profit, \\n(i.e. out of the profit of the company which would otherwise be available for \\ndividend) or out of proceeds of fresh issue of shares made for the purpose of \\nredemption; \\nb) no such shares can be redeemed unless they are fully paid; \\nc) (i) in case of such class of companies, as may be prescribed and whose \\nfinancial statement comply with the accounting standards prescribed for such \\nclass of companies under Section 133, the premium, if any, payable on \\nredemption shall be provided for out of the profits of the company, before the \\nshares are redeemed: \\nProvided also that premium, if any, payable on redemption of any preference \\nshares issued on or before the commencement of this Act by any such company \\nshall be provided for out of the profits of the company or out of the company's \\nsecurities premium account, before such shares are redeemed. (ii) in case of other companies (not falling under (i) above), the premium, if any \\npayable on redemption shall be provided for out of the profits of the company or \\nout of the company's securities premium account, before such shares are \\nredeemed. (Refer to the Note given in para 5.4.1 for the basis applied in the Illustrations in \\nthis Chapter.) \\nd) where any such shares are proposed to be redeemed out of the profits of \\nthe company, there shall, out of the divisible profits, i.e. the profits which \\nwould otherwise have been available for dividends, be transferred to a reserve \\naccount to be called Capital Redemption Reserve Account, a sum equal to the \\nnominal amount of the shares redeemed; and the provisions of the Act \\nrelating to the reduction of the share capital of a company shall, except as \\nprovided in the Section, apply as if the Capital Redemption Reserve (CRR) \\nAccount were the paid-up share capital of the company. The utilisation of \\nCRR Account is further restricted to issuance of fully paid-up bonus shares \\nonly. From the legal provision outlined above, it is apparent that on the redemption of \\nredeemable preference shares out of accumulated divisible profits, it will be \\nnecessary to transfer to the Capital Redemption Reserve Account an amount \\nequal to the amount repaid on the redemption of preference shares on account of \\nface value less proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the purpose of \\nredemption. The object is that with the repayment of redeemable preference \\nshares, the security for creditors/ bankers, etc. should not be reduced. At times, a \\npart of the preference share capital may be redeemed out of accumulated \\ndivisible profits and the balance out of a fresh issue. 5.4.METHODS OF REDEMPTION OF FULLY PAID-UP SHARES \\nRedemption of preference shares means repayment by the company of the \\nobligation on account of shares issued. According to the Companies Act, 2013, \\npreference shares issued by a company must be redeemed within the maximum \\nperiod (normally 20 years) allowed under the Act. Thus, a company cannot issue \\nirredeemable preference shares. Section 55 of the Companies Act, 2013, deals with provisions relating to \\nredemption of preference shares. It ensures that there is no reduction in \\nshareholders' funds due to \\nredemption and, thus, the interest of outsiders is not affected. For this, it requires \\nthat either fresh issue of shares is made, or distributable profits are retained and \\ntransferred to 'Capital Redemption Reserve Account'. The rationale behind these provisions is to protect the interest of outsiders to \\nwhom the amount is payable before redemption of preference share capital. The \\ninterest of outsiders is protected if the nominal value of capital redeemed is \\nsubstituted, thus, ensuring the same amount of shareholders' fund. •\\nIn case of redemption of preference shares out of proceeds of a fresh issue of \\nshares, replacement of capital and tangible assets is obvious. •\\nIf redemption is done out of distributable profits, replacement of capital is \\nensured in an indirect manner by retention of profit by transfer to Capital \\nRedemption Reserve. In this case, the amount which would have otherwise \\ngone to shareholders in the form of dividend is retained in the business and is \\nused for settling the claim of preference shareholders. Thus, there is no \\nadditional drain from the net assets of the Company. The transfer of divisible \\nprofits to Capital Redemption Reserve makes them nondivisible profits. As \\nCapital Redemption Reserve can be used only for issue of fully paid bonus \\nshares, profits retained in the business ultimately get converted into share \\ncapital. Security cover available to outside stakeholders depends upon called-up capital \\nas well as uncalled capital to be demanded by the company as per its \\nrequirements. To ensure that the interests of outsiders are not reduced, Section \\n55 provides for redemption of only fully paidup shares. From the above paras, it can be concluded that the 'gap' created in the company's \\ncapital by the redemption of redeemable preference shares must be filled in by: \\na) the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares; or \\nb) the capitalisation of undistributed profits (by creating Capital Redemption \\nReserve); or \\nc) a combination of (a) and (b) above. 5.4.1.Redemption of Preference Shares by Fresh Issue of Shares \\nOne of the methods for redemption of preference shares is to use the proceeds of \\na fresh issue of shares. A company can issue new shares (equity shares or \\npreference shares) and the proceeds from such new shares can be used for \\nredemption of preference shares. The proceeds from issue of debentures cannot be utilised for the purpose. A problem arises when a fresh issue is made for the purpose of redemption of \\npreference shares, at a premium. The point to ponder is that whether the \\nproceeds of a fresh issue of shares will include the amount of securities premium \\nfor the purpose of redemption of preference shares. For securities premium account, Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013 provides \\nthat the securities premium account may be applied by the company; \\na) Towards issue of un-issued shares of the company to be issued to \\nmembers of the company as fully paid bonus securities \\nb) To write off preliminary expenses of the company \\nc) To write off the expenses of, or commission paid, or discount allowed on \\nany of the securities or debentures of the company \\nd) To provide for premium on the redemption of redeemable preference \\nshares or debentures of the company. e) For the purchase of its own shares or other securities. Note: It may be noted that certain class of Companies whose financial statements \\ncomply with the Accounting Standards as prescribed under Section 133 of the \\nCompanies Act, 2013, can't apply the securities premium account for the \\npurposes (b) and (d) mentioned above. Note: All the questions in this chapter have been solved on the basis that the \\ncompanies referred in the questions are governed by Section 133 of the \\nCompanies Act, 2013 and comply with the Accounting Standards prescribed for \\nthem. Accordingly the balance in securities premium account has not been \\nutilized for the purpose of premium payable on redemption of preference shares. Any other way, except the above prescribed ways, in which securities premium \\naccount is utilised will be in contravention of law. Thus, the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares will not include the amount of \\nsecurities premium for the purpose of redemption of preference shares. Reasons for issue of New Equity Shares \\nA company may prefer issue of new equity shares for the following reasons: \\na. When the company has come to realise that the capital is needed \\npermanently and it makes more sense to issue Equity Shares in place of \\nRedeemable Preference Shares as Preference Shares carry a fixed rate of \\ndividend. b.\"), Document(page_content='When the balance of profit, which would otherwise be available for \\ndividend, is insufficient. c.'), Document(page_content='When the liquidity position of the company is not good enough.

This is done in four steps as \\ngiven below: \\n1) In such cases, the maximum amount of reserves and surplus available for \\nredemption is ascertained taking into account the balances appearing in the \\nbalance sheet before \\nredemption and the additional information provided in the problem. For \\nexample, if balance of general reserve in the balance sheet is ₹1,00,000 and \\nadditional information provides that the Board of Directors have decided that \\nthe balance of general reserve should not be less than \\n under any \\ncircumstances, then, the maximum amount of general reserve available for \\nredemption is ₹ 60,000. 2) After ascertaining the maximum amount of reserves and surplus available \\nfor redemption, adjustment for premium on redemption payable out of \\nprofits is made and then it is compared with the nominal value of shares to be \\nredeemed. By comparison, one gets the minimum proceeds of fresh issue as \\nSection 55 permits redemption either out of proceeds of fresh issue or out of \\ndivisible profits. Thus, \\nMinimum Proceeds of Fresh Issue of shares : \\nNominal value of preference shares to be redeemed - Maximum amount of \\nreserve and surplus available for redemption. 3) After computation of minimum proceeds, the minimum number of shares \\nto be issued are determined by dividing minimum proceeds by the proceeds \\nof one share. This is done as follows: \\nMinimum Number of Shares \\n Minimum proceeds to comply with Section 55/ \\nface value of one share \\nProceeds of one share mean the par value of a share issued, if it is issued at par or \\npremium. However, in case of issue of share at a discount, it refers to the \\ndiscounted value. 4) Minimum number of shares calculated as per (3) above, needs to be \\nadjusted due to various reasons. Firstly, shares fractions cannot be issued. Thus, if minimum number of shares as per (3) above includes a fraction, it \\nmust be approximated to the next higher figure to ensure that provisions of \\nSection 55 are not violated. Secondly, if the examination problem states that \\nthe proceeds/number of shares should be a multiple of say, 10 or 50 or 100 , \\nthen again the next higher multiple should be considered. 5.4.4.Fresh Issue at a Premium and Minimum Fresh Issue \\n₹40,000\\n=\\nThe calculation of minimum number of shares, when fresh issue is at a premium \\nshould be handled very carefully Minimum fresh issue cannot be calculated \\nunless one knows the profits available for replacement of preference shares and \\nprofit available for replacement cannot be determined unless one knows the \\nportion of profit available for redemption which is required for paying premium \\non redemption. To tackle this, assume that profits available for redemption is not \\nrequired for paying premium on redemption of preference shares. In other \\nwords, it means that securities premium including premium on fresh issue is \\ncomparatively more than premium on redemption. If the above assumption holds good, minimum number of shares can be \\ncalculated in a simple manner without use of equation. But, if above condition \\ndoes not hold good, then an equation is used to determine the minimum number \\nof shares. 5.4.5.Minimum Fresh Issue to Provide Funds for Redemption \\nBesides, ensuring compliance with Section 55, the fresh issue of shares is made to \\nprovide funds for making payment to preference shareholders. To calculate \\nminimum number of fresh shares to be issued to provide funds, amount payable \\nto preference shareholders is compared with funds available for redemption and \\nthe balance of funds to be raised by fresh issue of shares are calculated. The \\namount to be raised is divided by the issue price of a share (amount payable by \\nshareholder including premium, if any, on fresh issue) to compute the minimum \\nnumber of shares to be issued. 5.5.REDEMPTION OF PREFERENCE  SHARES BY CAPITALISATION \\nOF UNDISTRIBUTED DIVISIBLE PROFITS \\nAnother method for redemption of preference shares, as per the Companies Act, \\nis to use the distributable profits in place of issuing new shares. When shares are \\nredeemed by utilising distributable profit, an amount equal to the face value of \\nshares redeemed is transferred to Capital Redemption Reserve Account by \\ndebiting the distributable profit. In other words, some of the distributable profits \\nare kept aside to ensure that it can never be distributed to shareholders as \\ndividend. Profit or a portion of profit that can be otherwise legally distributed as dividend \\nto the shareholders is known as Divisible or Distributable Profit. In this connection, the provisions of the Companies Act state that 'When any such \\nshares are redeemed otherwise than out of the proceeds of a fresh issue, there \\nshall out of profits which would otherwise have been available for dividend (i.e. out of divisible profits), be transferred to a reserve to be called the Capital \\nRedemption Reserve Account sum equal to the nominal amount of the shares \\nredeemed'. Note: Only Divisible Profits can be used to create Capital Redemption Reserve, \\nNon-Divisible Profits cannot be used for this purpose. 5.5.1.Advantages of redemption of preference shares by capitalisation \\nof undistributed divisible profits \\nThe advantages of redemption of preference shares by capitalisation of \\nundistributed divisible profits are: \\n1. No change in the percentage of equity share-holding of the company; \\n2. Surplus funds can be used. 5.5.2.Disadvantages of redemption of preference shares by \\ncapitalisation of undistributed divisible profits \\nThe disadvantage of redemption of preference shares by capitalisation of \\nundistributed profits is that there will be a reduction in liquidity or assets may \\nneed to be sold such as investments.

In order to fill in the 'gap' between the face value of \\nshares redeemed and the proceeds of new issue, a transfer should be made from \\ndistributable profits (Profit & Loss Account, General Reserve and other Free \\nReserves) to Capital Redemption Reserve Account. Formula: \\nThe term 'proceeds from fresh/new issue' shall be interpreted as: \\na) Amount credited to Share Capital, in case of issue at par \\nb) Amount credited to Share Capital, in case of issue at premium. Though \\npremium is received which is credited to the Securities Premium A/c, the \\nsame shall not be regarded as 'proceeds', because if it were to be treated as \\nsuch, the transfer of distributable profits to the Capital Redemption Reserve \\nwould be lower by the amount of the premium received. c) Amount received (i.e., debited to Cash/Bank), in case of issue at a \\ndiscount. Note: Section 53 of the Companies Act, 2013 prohibits issue of shares at a \\ndiscount, except in case of issue of Sweat Equity Shares as outlined in Section 54.\"), Document(page_content='5.5.4. Sale of Investments to Provide Sufficient Funds for Redemption \\nCompanies may have sufficient investments, which can be sold, in the market to \\narrange funds for redemption of preference shares. 5.6 REDEMPTION OF PARTLY CALLED-UP PREFERENCE SHARES \\nOne of the conditions of redemption is that only fully paid up preference shares \\ncan be redeemed by a company. Hence: \\n1. If the problem states that it is decided to redeem preference shares which \\nare partly called up, then it is assumed that the final call on these shares is \\ndemanded and received before proceeding with redemption of these \\nshares. 2. If information about both fully paid and partly paid preference shares is \\nprovided, then, it is presumed that only fully paid shares are to be \\nredeemed and partly paid shares are left intact. 3. The company can forfeit the shares, if the call money is not received by the \\ncompany in spite of giving opportunity to pay the same via reminders. . 5.6.REDEMPTION OF FULLY CALLED BUT PARTLY PAID-UP \\nPREFERENCE SHARES \\nThe problem of unpaid calls on fully called up shares may be studied under \\nfollowing categories: \\n5.6.1.When the amount of calls-in-arrears is received by the company \\nIf the amount of unpaid calls is received by the Company before redemption, the \\nentry passed is as under: \\nBank A/c \\nDr. To Calls-in-Arrears A/c \\nAfter receipt of calls in arrears, the shares become fully paid up and then, \\ncompany can proceed with redemption in the normal course. 5.6.2.In case of Forfeited Shares \\nIf in spite of receiving a proper notice from the company, the shareholders fail to \\npay the unpaid calls, the Board of Directors may decide to forfeit the shares and \\ncancel these shares \\ninstead of reissuing the forfeited shares because redemption of these shares is \\ndue immediately or in near future. In this case, the journal entry for forfeiture is \\npassed as usual, which will be as follows: \\nPreference Share Capital A/c #   Dr \\n(#Called up share capital only relating to the shares to be forfeited) \\nTo Calls In Arrears A/c \\nTo Shares Forfeited A/c * \\n(*Amount actually collected on shares forfeited. This will be equal to the \\nbalancing amount) \\nNOTE: But it should be noted, in this case, that the number of shares to be \\nredeemed will be reduced by the number of shares so forfeited. Further, since the \\npreference shares are getting redeemed, the forfeited shares will not be reissued \\nand hence the balance in the Shares Forfeited \\n should be transferred to \\nCapital Reserve by passing the following journal entry: \\nShares Forfeited A/c  Dr. To Capital Reserve A/c \\nA /C\\nUNIT - 6: REDEMPTION OF DEBENTURES \\n6.1.INTRODUCTION \\nA debenture is an instrument issued by a company under its seal, acknowledging \\na debt and containing provisions as regards repayment of the principal and \\ninterest. Under Section 71 (1) of the Companies Act, 2013, a company may issue \\ndebentures with an option to convert such debentures into shares, either wholly \\nor partly at the time of redemption. Provided that the issue of debentures with an option to convert such debentures \\ninto shares, wholly or partly, should be approved by a special resolution passed at \\na duly convened general meeting. Section 71 (2) further provides that no company can issue any debentures which \\ncarry any voting rights. Section 71 (4) provides that where debentures are issued by a company, the \\ncompany should create a debenture redemption reserve account out of the profits \\nof the company available for payment of dividend and the amount credited to \\nsuch account should not be utilized by the company for any purpose other than \\nthe redemption of debentures. Basic provisions \\nIf a charge has been created on any asset or the entire assets of the company, \\n➢the nature of the charge \\n➢ the asset(s) charged \\nare described therein. •\\nSince the charge is not valid unless registered with the Registrar, his \\ncertificate registering the charge is printed on the bond. •\\nIt is also customary to create a trusteeship in favour of one or more persons in \\nthe case of mortgage debentures. The trustees of debenture holders have all \\npowers of a mortgage of a property and can act in whatever manner they think \\nnecessary to safeguard the interest of debenture holders. Note: Issue of debentures has already been discussed in detail in unit 3 of \\nChapter 11.'), Document(page_content='6.2.REDEMPTION OF DEBENTURES \\nDebentures are usually redeemable i.e. either redeemed in cash or convertible to \\nequity shares after a time period. Redeemable debentures may be redeemed: \\n➢ after a fixed number of years; or \\n➢ any time after a certain number of years has elapsed since their issue; or \\n➢ on giving a specified notice; or \\n➢by annual drawing. A company may also purchase its debentures, as and when convenient, in the \\nopen market. When the debentures are quoted at a discount on the Stock \\nExchange, it may be profitable for the company to purchase and cancel them. 6.3.DEBENTURE REDEMPTION RESERVE \\nA company issuing debentures may be required to create a debenture redemption \\nreserve account out of the profits available for distribution of dividend and \\namounts credited to such account cannot be utilised by the company for any \\nother purpose except for redemption of debentures. Such an arrangement would \\nensure that the company will have sufficient liquid funds for the redemption of \\ndebentures at the time they fall due for payment. An appropriate amount is transferred from profits every year to Debenture \\nRedemption Reserve and its investment is termed as Debenture Redemption \\nReserve Investment (or Debenture Redemption Fund). In the last year or at the \\ntime of redemption of debentures, Debenture Redemption Reserve Investments \\nare encashed and the amount so obtained is used for the redemption of \\ndebentures. 6.3.1.Requirement to create Debenture Redemption Reserve \\nSection 71 of the Companies Act 2013 covers the requirement of creating a \\ndebenture redemption reserve account. Section 71 states as follows: \\n1) Where a company issues debentures under this section, it should create a \\ndebenture redemption reserve account out of its profits which are available \\nfor distribution of dividend every year until such debentures are redeemed. 2) The amounts credited to the debenture redemption reserve should not be \\nutilised by the company for any purpose except for the purpose aforesaid. 3) The company should pay interest and redeem the debentures in \\naccordance with the terms and conditions of their issue. 4) Where a company fails to redeem the debentures on the date of maturity \\nor fails to pay the interest on debentures when they fall due, the Tribunal \\nmay, on the application of any or all the holders of debentures or debenture \\ntrustee and, after hearing the parties concerned, direct, by order, the \\ncompany to redeem the debentures forthwith by the payment of principal and \\ninterest due thereon. 6.3.2.Balance in Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR) \\nWhen the company decides to establish the Debenture Redemption Reserve \\nAccount, the amount indicated by the Debenture Redemption Reserves tables is \\ncredited to the Debenture Redemption Reserve account and debited to profit and \\nloss account. That shows the intention of the company to set aside sum of money \\nto build up a fund for redeeming debentures. Immediately, the company should \\nalso purchase outside investments. The entry for the purpose naturally will be to \\ndebit Debenture Redemption Reserve Investments and credit Bank. If the debentures are purchased within the interest period, the price would be \\ninclusive of interest provided these are purchased \"Cum-interest\"; but if \\npurchased \"Ex-interest\", the interest to the date of purchase would be payable to \\nthe seller additionally. In order to adjust the effect thereof the amount of interest \\naccrued till the date of purchase, if paid, is debited to the Interest Account against \\nwhich the interest for the whole period will be credited.'), Document(page_content='As a result, the balance in \\nthe account would be left equal to the interest for the period for which the \\ndebentures were held by the company. 6.3.3.Adequacy of Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR) \\nAs per Rule 18 (7) of the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Amendment \\nRules, 2019, the company shall comply with the requirements with regard to \\nDebenture Redemption Reserve (DRR) and investment or deposit of sum in \\nrespect of debentures maturing during the year ending on the 31st day of March \\nof next year (refer para 6.4 below), in accordance with the conditions given \\nbelow- \\nthe Debenture Redemption Reserve shall be created out of the profits of the \\ncompany available for payment of dividend; the limits with respect to adequacy \\nof DRR and investment or deposits, as the case may be, shall be as under: \\nDebentures Issued by and Adequacy of Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR) \\n1.

The amount deposited or invested, as the case may be, above should not be \\nutilised for any purpose other than for the redemption of debentures maturing \\nduring the year referred to above.'), Document(page_content='Provided that the amount remaining deposited or invested, as the case may be, \\nshall not at any time fall below \\n of the amount of debentures maturing during \\nthe 31 st day of March of that year. In case of partly convertible debentures, DRR shall be created in respect of non-\\nconvertible portion of debenture issue. The amount credited to DRR shall not be utilised by the company except for the \\npurpose of redemption of debentures. Note: It should be noted that appropriation to DRR can be made any time before \\nredemption and Investments in specified securities as mentioned above can be \\ndone before 30th April for the debentures maturing that year, however, for the \\nsake of simplicity and ease, it is advisable to make the appropriation and \\ninvestment immediately after the debentures are allotted assuming that the \\ncompany has sufficient amount of profits (issued if allotment date is not given in \\nthe question). Also, in some cases, the date of allotment could be missing, in such \\n15%\\n15%\\ncases the appropriation and investments should be done on the first day of that \\nyear for which ledgers accounts are to be drafted. 6.3.5.Journal Entries \\nThe necessary journal entries passed in the books of a company are given below: \\n1.
