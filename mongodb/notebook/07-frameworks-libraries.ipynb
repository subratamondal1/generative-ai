MongoDB Atlas is available on-demand\\nthrough a pay-as-you-go model and billed on an hourly\\nbasis, letting you focus on what you do best.\\nIt’s easy to get started – use a simple GUI to select the\\ninstance size, region, and features you need.

While this guide is broad in scope, it\\nis not exhaustive. Following the recommendations in this\\nguide will provide a solid foundation for ensuring optimal\\napplication performance.\\nFor the most detailed information on specific topics, please\\nsee the on-line documentation at mongodb.com. Many\\nlinks are provided throughout this white paper to help\\nguide users to the appropriate resources.\\nPreparing for a MongoDB\\nDeployment\\nSchema Design\\nDevelopers and data architects should work together to\\ndevelop the right data model, and they should invest time in\\nthis exercise early in the project. The requirements of the\\napplication should drive the data model, updates, and\\nqueries of your MongoDB system. Given MongoDB's\\ndynamic schema, developers and data architects can\\ncontinue to iterate on the data model throughout the\\ndevelopment and deployment processes to optimize\\nperformance and storage efficiency, as well as support the\\naddition of new application features. All of this can be done\\nwithout expensive schema migrations.\\nDocument Model\\nMongoDB stores data as documents in a binary\\nrepresentation called BSON. The BSON encoding extends\\nthe popular JSON representation to include additional\\ntypes such as int, long, date, and decimal128. BSON\\ndocuments contain one or more fields, and each field\\ncontains a value of a specific data type, including arrays,\\nsub-documents and binary data. It may be helpful to think\\nof documents as roughly equivalent to rows in a relational\\ndatabase, and fields as roughly equivalent to columns.\\nHowever, MongoDB documents tend to have all related\\ndata for a given record or object in a single document,\\nwhereas in a relational database, that data is usually\\nnormalized across rows in many tables. For example, data\\nthat belongs to a parent-child relationship in two RDBMS\\ntables can frequently be collapsed (embedded) into a\\nsingle document in MongoDB. For operational applications,\\nthe document model makes JOINs redundant in many\\ncases.\\nWhere possible, store all data for a record in a single\\ndocument. When data for a record is stored in a single\\ndocument the entire record can be retrieved in a single\\nseek operation, which is very efficient. In some cases it\\nmay not be practical to store all data in a single document,\\nor it may negatively impact other operations. Make the\\ntrade-offs that are best for your application. MongoDB\\nsupports ACID compliance at the document level;\\nmulti-document ACID transactions are available for users\\nrunning MongoDB 4.0 or later.\\nCollections\\nCollections are groupings of documents. Typically all\\ndocuments in a collection have similar or related purposes\\nfor an application. It may be helpful to think of collections\\nas being analogous to tables in a relational database.\\nDynamic Schema & JSON Schema Validation\\nMongoDB documents can vary in structure. For example,\\ndocuments that describe users might all contain the user id\\nand the last date they logged into the system, but only\\nsome of these documents might contain the user's\\nshipping address, and perhaps some of those contain\\nmultiple shipping addresses. MongoDB does not require\\nthat all documents conform to the same structure.\\nFurthermore, there is no need to declare the structure of\\ndocuments to the system – documents are self-describing.\\nDBAs and developers have the option to define JSON\\nSchema Validation rules, enabling them to precisely control\\ndocument structures, choose the level of validation\\nrequired, and decide how exceptions are handled. As a\\nresult, DBAs can apply data governance standards, while\\ndevelopers maintain the benefits of a flexible document\\nmodel. Validation occurs during updates and inserts. When\\nvalidation rules are added to a collection, existing\\ndocuments do not undergo validation checks until\\nmodification.\\n2\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4HkJP', 'page': 4}, page_content='Indexes\\nMongoDB uses B-tree indexes to optimize queries. Indexes\\nare defined on a collection’s document fields. MongoDB\\nincludes support for many indexes, including compound,\\ngeospatial, TTL, text search, sparse, partial, unique, and\\nothers. For more information see the section on indexing\\nbelow.\\nTransactions\\nMulti-document ACID transactions are available for users\\nof MongoDB 4.0 and later. With snapshot isolation and\\nall-or-nothing execution, transactions extend MongoDB\\nACID data integrity guarantees to multiple statements and\\nmultiple documents across one or many collections and\\ndatabases. They feel just like the transactions you are\\nfamiliar with from relational databases, are easy to add to\\nany application that needs them, and do not impact the\\nperformance of operations that don’t require them. With\\nmulti-document transactions it’s easier than ever for all\\ndevelopers to address a complete range of use cases with\\nMongoDB.\\nBecause documents can bring together related data that\\nwould otherwise be modeled across separate parent-child\\ntables in a tabular schema, MongoDB’s atomic\\nsingle-document operations provide transaction semantics\\nthat meet the data integrity needs of the majority of\\napplications. One or more fields may be written in a single\\noperation, including updates to multiple sub-documents\\nand elements of an array. The guarantees provided by\\nMongoDB ensure complete isolation as a document is\\nupdated; any errors cause the operation to roll back so that\\nclients receive a consistent view of the document. These\\nexisting document atomicity guarantees will meet 80-90%\\nof an application’s transactional needs.\\nThere are, however, use cases where transactional ACID\\nguarantees need to be applied to a set of operations that\\nspan multiple documents, most commonly with apps that\\ndeal with the exchange of value between different parties\\nand require “all-or-nothing” execution. Back office “System\\nof Record” or “Line of Business” (LoB) applications are the\\ntypical class of workload where multi-document\\ntransactions can be useful.\\nTo maintain predictable levels of database performance\\nwhile using transactions, developers should consider the\\nfollowing:\\n• As a best practice, no more than 1,000 documents\\nshould be modified within a transaction. For operations\\nthat need to modify more than 1,000 documents,\\ndevelopers should break the transaction into separate\\nparts that process documents in batches.\\n• In MongoDB 4.0, a transaction is represented in a\\nsingle oplog entry, therefore must be within the 16MB\\ndocument size limit. While an update operation only\\nstores the deltas of the update (i.e., what has changed),\\nan insert will store the entire document. As a result, the\\ncombination of oplog descriptions for all statements in\\nthe transaction must be less than 16MB. If this limit is\\nexceeded, the transaction will be aborted and fully rolled\\nback. The transaction should therefore be decomposed\\ninto a smaller set of operations that can be represented\\nin 16MB or less.\\n• When a transaction aborts, an exception is returned to\\nthe driver and the transaction is fully rolled back.\\nDevelopers should add application logic that can catch\\nand retry a transaction that aborts due to temporary\\nexceptions, such as a transient network failure or a\\nprimary replica election. The commit operations are\\nretryable write operations. If the commit operation\\noperation encounters an error, MongoDB drivers retry\\nthe operation a single time.\\n• DDL operations, like creating an index or dropping a\\ndatabase, block behind active running transactions on\\nthe namespace. All transactions that try to newly access\\nthe namespace while DDL operations are pending, will\\nnot be able to obtain locks, aborting the new\\ntransactions\\nYou can review all best practices in the documentation for\\ntransactions.\\nAdding transactions does not make MongoDB a relational\\ndatabase – many developers have already experienced that\\nthe document model is superior to the relational one. All\\nbest practices relating to MongoDB data modeling\\ncontinue to apply when using multi-document transactions,\\nor to other relational-type features such as fully expressive\\nJOINs. Where practical, all data relating to an entity should\\n3'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4HkJP', 'page': 5}, page_content='be stored in a single, rich document structure. Simply\\nmoving tabular data normalized for relational tables into\\nMongoDB will not allow users to take advantage of\\nMongoDB’s natural, fast, and flexible document model, or\\nits distributed systems architecture.\\nFor more information on schema design, please see Data\\nModeling Considerations for MongoDB in the MongoDB\\nDocumentation.\\nApplication Access Patterns\\nWhile schema design has a huge influence on\\nperformance, how the application accesses the data can\\nalso have a major impact.\\nSearching on indexed attributes is typically the single most\\nimportant pattern as it avoids collection scans. Taking it a\\nstep further, using covercovered queriesed queries avoids the need to\\naccess the collection data altogether. Covered queries\\nreturn results from the indexes directly without accessing\\ndocuments and are therefore very efficient. For a query to\\nbe covered, all the fields included in the query must be\\npresent in an index, and all the fields returned by the query\\nmust also be present in that index. To determine whether a\\nquery is a covered query, use the explain()method. If\\nthe explain()output displays truefor the indexOnly\\nfield, the query is covered by an index, and MongoDB\\nqueries only that index to match the query and return the\\nresults.\\nRather than retrieving the entire document in your\\napplication, updating fields, then saving the document back\\nto the database, instead issue the update to specific fields.\\nThis has the advantage of less network usage and reduced\\ndatabase overhead.\\nDocument Size\\nThe maximum BSON document size in MongoDB is 16\\nMB. Users should avoid certain application patterns that\\nwould allow documents to grow unbounded. For example,\\nin an e-commerce application it would be difficult to\\nestimate how many reviews each product might receive\\nfrom customers. Furthermore, it is typically the case that\\nonly a subset of reviews is displayed to a user, such as the\\nmost popular or the most recent reviews. Rather than\\nmodeling the product and customer reviews as a single\\ndocument it would be better to model each review or\\ngroups of reviews as a separate document with a\\nreference to the product document; while also storing the\\nkey reviews in the product document for fast access.\\nIn practice most documents are a few kilobytes or less.\\nConsider documents more like rows in a table than the\\ntables themselves. Rather than maintaining lists of records\\nin a single document, instead make each record a\\ndocument. For large media items, such as video or images,\\nconsider using GridFS, a convention implemented by all the\\ndrivers that automatically stores the binary data across\\nmany smaller documents.\\nField names are repeated across documents and consume\\nspace – RAM in particular. By using smaller field names\\nyour data will consume less space, which allows for a\\nlarger number of documents to fit in RAM\\nGridFS\\nFor files larger than 16 MB, MongoDB provides a\\nconvention called GridFS, which is implemented by all\\nMongoDB drivers. GridFS automatically divides large data\\ninto 256 KB pieces called chunks and maintains the\\nmetadata for all chunks. GridFS allows for retrieval of\\nindividual chunks as well as entire documents. For example,\\nan application could quickly jump to a specific timestamp in\\na video. GridFS is frequently used to store large binary files\\nsuch as images and videos directly in MongoDB, without\\noffloading them to a separate filesystem.\\nData Lifecycle Management\\nMongoDB provides features to facilitate the management\\nof data lifecycles, including Time to Live indexes, and\\ncapped collections.\\nTime to Live (TTL)\\nIf documents in a collection should only persist for a\\npre-defined period of time, the TTL feature can be used to\\nautomatically delete documents of a certain age rather\\nthan scheduling a process to check the age of all\\ndocuments and run a series of deletes. For example, if user\\nsessions should only exist for one hour, the TTL can be set\\n4'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4HkJP', 'page': 6}, page_content='to 3600 seconds for a date field called lastActivity\\nthat exists in documents used to track user sessions and\\ntheir last interaction with the system. A background thread\\nwill automatically check all these documents and delete\\nthose that have been idle for more than 3600 seconds.\\nAnother example use case for TTL is a price quote that\\nshould automatically expire after a period of time.\\nCapped Collections\\nIn some cases a rolling window of data should be\\nmaintained in the system based on data size. Capped\\ncollections are fixed-size collections that support\\nhigh-throughput inserts and reads based on insertion order.\\nA capped collection behaves like a circular buffer: data is\\ninserted into the collection, that insertion order is\\npreserved, and when the total size reaches the threshold of\\nthe capped collection, the oldest documents are deleted to\\nmake room for the newest documents. For example, store\\nlog information from a high-volume system in a capped\\ncollection to quickly retrieve the most recent log entries.\\nDropping a Collection\\nIt is very efficient to drop a collection in MongoDB. If your\\ndata lifecycle management requires periodically deleting\\nlarge volumes of documents, it may be best to model those\\ndocuments as a single collection. Dropping a collection is\\nmuch more efficient than removing all documents or a\\nlarge subset of a collection, just as dropping a table is more\\nefficient than deleting all the rows in a table in a relational\\ndatabase.\\nDisk space is automatically reclaimed after a collection is\\ndropped.\\nIndexing\\nLike most database management systems, indexes are a\\ncrucial mechanism for optimizing MongoDB query\\nperformance. While indexes will improve the performance\\nof some operations by one or more orders of magnitude,\\nthey incur overhead to updates, disk space, and memory\\nusage. Users should always create indexes to support\\nqueries, but should not maintain indexes that queries do\\nnot use. This is particularly important for deployments that\\nsupport insert-heavy (or writes which modify indexed\\nvalues) workloads.\\nMongoDB Atlas surfaces index information for a collection\\nin the Data Explorer. The Indexes tab of the Data Explorer\\nlists the indexes and associated index information — the\\nindex definition, the size, and the usage frequency — for\\nthe collection. Alternatively, an $indexStatsaggregation\\nstage can be used to determine how frequently each index\\nis used.\\nQuery Optimization\\nQueries are automatically optimized by MongoDB to make\\nevaluation of the query as efficient as possible. Evaluation\\nnormally includes the selection of data based on\\npredicates, and the sorting of data based on the sort\\ncriteria provided. The query optimizer selects the best\\nindexes to use by periodically running alternate query plans\\nand selecting the index with the best performance for each\\nquery type. The results of this empirical test are stored as a\\ncached query plan and periodically updated.\\nMongoDB provides an explainplan capability that shows\\ninformation about how a query will be, or was, resolved,\\nincluding:\\n• The number of documents returned\\n• The number of documents read\\n• Which indexes were used\\n• Whether the query was covered, meaning no documents\\nneeded to be read to return results\\n• Whether an in-memory sort was performed, which\\nindicates an index would be beneficial\\n• The number of index entries scanned\\n• How long the query took to resolve in milliseconds\\n(when using the executionStatsmode)\\n• Which alternative query plans were rejected (when\\nusing the allPlansExecutionmode)\\nMongoDB provides the ability to view how a query will be\\nevaluated in the system, including which indexes are used\\nand whether the query is covered. This capability is similar\\nto the Explain Plan and similar features in relational\\n5'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4HkJP', 'page': 7}, page_content='databases. You should test every query in your application\\nusing explain().\\nThe explain plan will show 0 milliseconds if the query was\\nresolved in less than 1 ms, which is typical in well-tuned\\nsystems. When the explain plan is called, prior cached\\nquery plans are abandoned, and the process of testing\\nmultiple indexes is repeated to ensure the best possible\\nplan is used. The query plan can be calculated and\\nreturned without first having to run the query. This enables\\nDBAs to review which plan will be used to execute the\\nquery, without having to wait for the query to run to\\ncompletion. The feedback from explain()will help you\\nunderstand whether your query is performing optimally.\\nDatabase Profiler\\nMongoDB provides a profiling capability called Database\\nProfiler, which logs fine-grained information about\\ndatabase operations. The profiler can be enabled to log\\ninformation for all events or only those events whose\\nduration exceeds a configurable threshold (whose default\\nis 100 ms). Profiling data is stored in a capped collection\\nwhere it can easily be searched for relevant events.\\nFor all dedicated MongoDB Atlas clusters, users have\\naccess to the Performance Advisor, which identifies\\nslow-running queries (100 ms or longer to execute) and\\nsuggests new indexes to improve query performance.\\nSuggested indexes are accompanied by sample queries\\n(grouped by query shape) that were run against a\\ncollection that would benefit from the new index. All\\nsuggested indexes represent an opportunity to improve\\nquery performance.\\nEach sample query includes a query inefficiency score,\\nwhich is how many documents were read for every\\ndocument returned by the query. A score of 1 represents a\\nvery efficient query because every document read matched\\nthe query and was returned with the query results. The\\nPerformance Advisor displays a warning icon next to any\\nscore over 1,000, which represent highly inefficient\\nqueries.\\nThe Performance Advisor is always enabled and does not\\nnegatively affect the performance of your Atlas clusters.\\nFor more information, visit the Performance Advisor\\ndocumentation.\\nPrimary and Secondary Indexes\\nA unique index on the _idattribute is created for all\\ndocuments. MongoDB will automatically create the _id\\nfield and assign a unique value if the value is not be\\nspecified when the document is inserted. All user-defined\\nindexes are secondary indexes. MongoDB includes support\\nfor many types of secondary indexes that can be declared\\non any field(s) in the document, including fields within\\narrays and sub-documents. Index options include:\\n• Compound indexes\\n• Geospatial indexes\\n• Text search indexes\\n• Unique indexes\\n• Array indexes\\n• TTL indexes\\n• Sparse indexes\\n• Partial Indexes\\n• Hash indexes\\n• Collated indexes for different languages\\nYou can learn more about each of these indexes from the\\nMongoDB Architecture Guide\\nIndex Creation Options\\nIndexes and data are updated synchronously in MongoDB,\\nthus ensuring queries on indexes never return stale or\\ndeleted data. The appropriate indexes should be\\ndetermined as part of the schema design process. By\\ndefault creating an index is a blocking operation in\\nMongoDB. Because the creation of indexes can be time\\nand resource intensive, MongoDB provides an option for\\ncreating new indexes in a rolling fashion across the primary\\nand secondary members of a replica set. When this option\\nis enabled, the total time to create an index will be greater\\nthan if the index was created in the foreground, but it will\\nstill be possible to query the database while creating\\nindexes.\\n6'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4HkJP', 'page': 8}, page_content='MongoDB Atlas allows you to create indexes within the\\nData Explorer UI in the Indexes tab. Atlas also enables you\\nto build indexes in a rolling fashion and reduce the impact\\nof building indexes on replica sets and sharded clusters. To\\nmaintain cluster availability during this process, Atlas\\nremoves one node from the cluster at a time starting with a\\nsecondary.\\nIndex Limitations\\nAs with any database, indexes consume disk space and\\nmemory, so should only be used as necessary. Indexes can\\nimpact update performance. An update must first locate\\nthe data to change, so an index will help in this regard, but\\nindex maintenance itself has overhead and this work will\\nreduce update performance.\\nThere are several index limitations that should be observed\\nwhen deploying MongoDB:\\n• A collection cannot have more than 64 indexes\\n• Index entries cannot exceed 1024 bytes\\n• The name of an index must not exceed 125 characters\\n(including its namespace)\\n• In-memory sorting of data without an index is limited to\\n32MB. This operation is very CPU intensive, and\\nin-memory sorts indicate an index should be created to\\noptimize these queries\\nCommon Mistakes Regarding Indexes\\nThe following tips may help to avoid some common\\nmistakes regarding indexes:\\n• Use a compound index rather than indexUse a compound index rather than index\\nintersection:intersection: For best performance when querying via\\nmultiple predicates, compound indexes will generally be\\na better option\\n• Compound indexesCompound indexes: Compound indexes are defined\\nand ordered by field. So, if a compound index is defined\\nfor last name, first nameand city, queries that\\nspecify last nameor last nameand first namewill\\nbe able to use this index, but queries that try to search\\nbased on citywill not be able to benefit from this\\nindex. Remove indexes that are prefixes of other\\nindexes\\n• LLow selectivity indexesow selectivity indexes: An index should radically\\nreduce the set of possible documents to select from.\\nFor example, an index on a field that indicates gender is\\nnot as beneficial as an index on zip code, or even better,\\nphone number\\n• Regular exprRegular expressionsessions: Indexes are ordered by value,\\nhence leading wildcards are inefficient and may result in\\nfull index scans. Trailing wildcards can be efficient if\\nthere are sufficient case-sensitive leading characters in\\nthe expression\\n• NegationNegation: Inequality queries can be inefficient with\\nrespect to indexes. Like most database systems,\\nMongoDB does not index the absence of values and\\nnegation conditions may require scanning all\\ndocuments. If negation is the only condition and it is not\\nselective (for example, querying an orders table, where\\n99% of the orders are complete, to identify those that\\nhave not been fulfilled), all records will need to be\\nscanned.\\n• Eliminate unnecessary indexesEliminate unnecessary indexes: Indexes are\\nresource-intensive: even with they consume RAM, and\\nas fields are updated their associated indexes must be\\nmaintained, incurring additional disk I/O overhead. To\\nunderstand the effectiveness of the existing indexes\\nbeing used, use the Indexes tab of the Data Explorer,\\nwhich shows all the indexes for a given collection and\\nthe usage frequency. Alternatively, an $indexStats\\naggregation stage can be used to determine how\\nfrequently each index is used. If there are indexes that\\nare not used then removing them will reduce storage\\nand speed up writes.\\n• Partial indexesPartial indexes: If only a subset of documents need to\\nbe included in a given index then the index can be made\\npartial by specifying a filter expression. e.g., if an index\\non the userIDfield is only needed for querying open\\norders then it can be made conditional on the order\\nstatus being set to in progress. In this way, partial\\nindexes improve query performance while minimizing\\noverheads.\\nWorking Sets\\nMongoDB makes extensive use of RAM to speed up\\ndatabase operations. In MongoDB, all data is read and\\nmanipulated through in-memory representations of the\\n7'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4HkJP', 'page': 9}, page_content=\"data. Reading data from memory is measured in\\nnanoseconds and reading data from disk is measured in\\nmilliseconds, thus reading from memory is orders of\\nmagnitude faster than reading from disk.\\nThe set of data and indexes that are accessed during\\nnormal operations is called the working set. It is best\\npractice that the working set fits in RAM. It may be the\\ncase the working set represents a fraction of the entire\\ndatabase, such as in applications where data related to\\nrecent events or popular products is accessed most\\ncommonly.\\nWhen MongoDB attempts to access data that has not\\nbeen loaded in RAM, it must be read from disk. If there is\\nfree memory then the operating system can locate the data\\non disk and load it into memory directly. However, if there is\\nno free memory, MongoDB must write some other data\\nfrom memory to disk, and then read the requested data\\ninto memory. This process can be time consuming and\\nsignificantly slower than accessing data that is already\\nresident in memory.\\nSome operations may inadvertently purge a large\\npercentage of the working set from memory, which\\nadversely affects performance. For example, a query that\\nscans all documents in the database, where the database\\nis larger than available RAM on the server, will cause\\ndocuments to be read into memory and may lead to\\nportions of the working set being written out to disk. Other\\nexamples include various maintenance operations such as\\ncompacting or repairing a database and rebuilding indexes.\\nIf your database working set size exceeds the available\\nRAM of your system, consider provisioning an instance\\nwith larger RAM capacity (scaling up) or sharding the\\ndatabase across additional instances (scaling out). Scaling\\nis an automated, on-line operation which is launched by\\nselecting the new configuration after clicking the\\nCONFIGURE button in MongoDB Atlas. For a discussion\\non this topic, refer to the section on Sharding Best\\nPractices later in the guide. It is easier to implement\\nsharding before the system’s resources are consumed, so\\ncapacity planning is an important element in successful\\nproject delivery.\\nData Migration\\nUsers should assess how best to model their data for their\\napplications rather than simply importing the flat file\\nexports of their legacy systems. In a traditional relational\\ndatabase environment, data tends to be moved between\\nsystems using delimited flat files such as CSV. While it is\\npossible to ingest data into MongoDB from CSV files, this\\nmay in fact only be the first step in a data migration\\nprocess. It is typically the case that MongoDB's document\\ndata model provides advantages and alternatives that do\\nnot exist in a relational data model.\\nThere are many options to migrate data from flat files into\\nrich JSON documents, including mongoimport, custom\\nscripts, ETL tools and from within an application itself\\nwhich can read from the existing RDBMS and then write a\\nJSON version of the document back to MongoDB.\\nFor importing data from a pre-existing MongoDB system,\\nMongoDB Atlas includes a live migration service built into\\nthe GUI. This functionality works with any MongoDB\\nreplica set or sharded cluster running MongoDB 2.6 or\\nhigher. Step-by-step tutorials for the Atlas Live Migraton\\nService can be found here.\\nOther tools such as mongodumpand mongorestore, or\\nMongoDB Atlas backups are also useful for moving data\\nbetween different MongoDB systems.\\nMongoDB Atlas Cluster Selection\\nThe following recommendations are only intended to\\nprovide high-level guidance for hardware for a MongoDB\\ndeployment. The specific configuration of your hardware\\nwill be dependent on your data, queries, performance SLA,\\nand availability requirements.\\nMemory\\nAs with most databases, MongoDB performs best when\\nthe working set (indexes and most frequently accessed\\ndata) fits in RAM. Sufficient RAM is the most important\\nfactor for instance selection; other optimizations may not\\nsignificantly improve the performance of the system if\\nthere is insufficient RAM.

Specifically, the total\\nnumber of active threads (i.e., concurrent operations)\\nrelative to the number of CPUs can impact performance:\\n• Throughput increases as the number of concurrent\\nactive operations increases up to and beyond the\\nnumber of CPUs\\n• Throughput eventually decreases as the number of\\nconcurrent active operations exceeds the number of\\nCPUs by some threshold amount\\nThe threshold amount depends on your application. You\\ncan determine the optimum number of concurrent active\\noperations for your application by experimenting and\\nmeasuring throughput.\\nThe larger MongoDB Atlas instances include more virtual\\nCPUs and so should be considered for heavily concurrent\\nworkloads.\\nCluster Class — AWS Only\\nMongoDB Atlas offers different classes of clusters for\\nM40 and larger deployments on AWS:\\n• LLow CPow CPUU: Lower ratio of CPU to memory with high\\nnetwork performance.

MongoDB distributes data\\nacross multiple Replica Sets called shards. With automatic\\nbalancing, MongoDB ensures data is equally distributed\\nacross shards as data volumes grow or the size of the\\ncluster increases or decreases. Sharding allows MongoDB\\ndeployments to scale beyond the limitations of a single\\nserver, such as bottlenecks in RAM or disk I/O, without\\nadding complexity to the application.\\nMongoDB Atlas supports multiple sharding policies,\\nenabling administrators to accommodate diverse query\\npatterns:\\n• Range-based sharRange-based sharding:ding: Documents are partitioned\\nacross shards according to the shard key value.\\nDocuments with shard key values close to one another\\nare likely to be co-located on the same shard.

Cardinality: Data partitioning is managed in 64 MB\\nchunks by default. Low cardinality (e.g., a user's home\\ncountry) will tend to group documents together on a\\nsmall number of shards, which in turn will require\\nfrequent rebalancing of the chunks; a single country is\\nalso likely to exceed the 64 MB chunk size. Instead, a\\nshard key should exhibit high cardinality.\\n2. Insert Scaling: Writes should be evenly distributed\\nacross all shards based on the shard key. If the shard\\nkey is monotonically increasing, for example, all inserts\\nwill go to the same shard even if they exhibit high\\ncardinality, thereby creating an insert hotspot. Instead,\\nthe key should be evenly distributed.\\n3. Query Isolation: Queries should be targeted to a specific\\nshard to maximize scalability. If queries cannot be\\nisolated to a specific shard, all shards will be queried in\\na pattern called scatter/gather, which is less efficient\\nthan querying a single shard.\\n4. Ensure uniform distribution of shard keys: When shard\\nkeys are not uniformly distributed for reads and writes,\\noperations may be limited by the capacity of a single\\nshard. When shard keys are uniformly distributed, no\\nsingle shard will limit the capacity of the system.\\nFor more on selecting a shard key, see Considerations for\\nSelecting Shard Keys.\\nAAvoid scvoid scatter-gather queriesatter-gather queries: In sharded systems,\\nqueries that cannot be routed to a single shard must be\\nbroadcast to multiple shards for evaluation.

Replica failover is fully\\nautomated, eliminating the need to manually intervene to\\nrecover nodes in the event of a failure.\\nA replica set consists of multiple replica nodes. At any\\ngiven time, one member acts as the primary replica and the\\nother members act as secondary replicas. If the primary\\nmember fails for any reason (e.g., a failure of the host\\nsystem), one of the secondary members is automatically\\nelected to primary and begins to accept all writes; this is\\ntypically completed in 2 seconds or less and reads can\\noptionally continue on the secondaries.\\nSophisticated algorithms control the election process,\\nensuring only the most suitable secondary member is\\npromoted to primary, and reducing the risk of unnecessary\\nfailovers (also known as \"false positives\"). The election\\nalgorithm processes a range of parameters including\\nconnectivity status and analysis of histories to identify\\nthose replica set members that have applied the most\\nrecent updates from the primary.\\nA larger number of replica nodes provides increased\\nprotection against database downtime in case of multiple\\nmachine failures.\\nMongoDB Atlas replica sets have a minimum of 3 nodes\\nand can be configured to have a maximum of 50 nodes.\\nAtlas automatically distributes the nodes within a replica\\nset across the availability zones in the region you choose.\\nThe definition of an availability zone varies slightly between\\nAWS, Azure, and GCP but the general concept is similar.\\nFor example, on AWS, each availability zone is isolated and\\nconnected with low-latency links.\\nAtlas also enables you to deploy across multiple regions\\n(within a single cloud provider) for better availability\\nguarantees.

Alerts can be configured against\\neach monitored metric to proactively warn administrators of\\npotential issues before users experience a problem. The\\nMongoDB Atlas team are also monitoring the underlying\\ninfrastructure, ensuring that it is always in a healthy state.\\nApplication Logs And Database Logs\\nApplication and database logs should be monitored for\\nerrors and other system information. It is important to\\ncorrelate your application and database logs in order to\\ndetermine whether activity in the application is ultimately\\nresponsible for other issues in the system. For example, a\\nspike in user writes may increase the volume of writes to\\nMongoDB, which in turn may overwhelm the underlying\\nstorage system. Without the correlation of application and\\ndatabase logs, it might take more time than necessary to\\nestablish that the application is responsible for the\\nincrease in writes rather than some process running in\\nMongoDB.\\nPage Faults\\nWhen a working set ceases to fit in memory, or other\\noperations have moved working set data out of memory,\\nthe volume of page faults may spike in your MongoDB\\nsystem.\\nDisk\\nBeyond memory, disk I/O is also a key performance\\nconsideration for a MongoDB system because writes are\\njournaled and regularly flushed to disk. Under heavy write\\nload the underlying disk subsystem may become\\noverwhelmed, or other processes could be contending with\\nMongoDB, or the storage speed chosen may be\\ninadequate for the volume of writes.\\nCPU\\nA variety of issues could trigger high CPU utilization. This\\nmay be normal under most circumstances, but if high CPU\\nutilization is observed without other issues such as disk\\nsaturation or pagefaults, there may be an unusual issue\\nin the system. For example, a MapReduce job with an\\ninfinite loop, or a query that sorts and filters a large number\\nof documents from the working set without good index\\ncoverage, might cause a spike in CPU without triggering\\nissues in the disk system or pagefaults.\\nConnections\\nMongoDB drivers implement connection pooling to\\nfacilitate efficient use of resources. Each connection\\nconsumes 1MB of RAM, so be careful to monitor the total\\nnumber of connections so they do not overwhelm RAM\\nand reduce the available memory for the working set. This\\ntypically happens when client applications do not properly\\nclose their connections, or with Java in particular, that relies\\non garbage collection to close the connections.\\nOp Counters\\nThe utilization baselines for your application will help you\\ndetermine a normal count of operations. If these counts\\nstart to substantially deviate from your baselines it may be\\nan indicator that something has changed in the application,\\nor that a malicious attack is underway.\\nQueues\\nIf MongoDB is unable to complete all requests in a timely\\nfashion, requests will begin to queue up. A healthy\\ndeployment will exhibit very short queues. If metrics start to\\ndeviate from baseline performance, requests from\\napplications will start to queue. The queue is therefore a\\ngood first place to look to determine if there are issues that\\nwill affect user experience.\\nShard Balancing\\nOne of the goals of sharding is to uniformly distribute data\\nacross multiple servers. If the utilization of server resources\\nis not approximately equal across servers there may be an\\nunderlying issue that is problematic for the deployment. For\\n14\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4HkJP', 'page': 16}, page_content='example, a poorly selected shard key can result in uneven\\ndata distribution. In this case, most if not all of the queries\\nwill be directed to the single mongodthat is managing the\\ndata. Furthermore, MongoDB may be attempting to\\nredistribute the documents to achieve a more ideal balance\\nacross the servers. While redistribution will eventually result\\nin a more desirable distribution of documents, there is\\nsubstantial work associated with rebalancing the data and\\nthis activity itself may interfere with achieving the desired\\nperformance SLA.\\nIf in the course of a deployment it is determined that a new\\nshard key should be used, it will be necessary to reload the\\ndata with a new shard key because designation and values\\nof the shard keys are immutable. To support the use of a\\nnew shard key, it is possible to write a script that reads\\neach document, updates the shard key, and writes it back\\nto the database.\\nReplication Lag\\nReplication lag is the amount of time it takes a write\\noperation on the primary replica set member to replicate to\\na secondary member. A small amount of delay is normal,\\nbut as replication lag grows, significant issues may arise.\\nIf this is observed then replication throughput can be\\nincreased by moving to larger MongoDB Atlas instances or\\nadding shards.\\nDisaster Recovery: Backup & Restore\\nA backup and recovery strategy is necessary to protect\\nyour mission-critical data against catastrophic failure, such\\nas a software bug or a user accidentally dropping\\ncollections.

Protect data in motion over the network\\nand at rest in persistent storage\\nTo ensure a secure system right out of the box,\\nauthentication and IP Address whitelisting are\\nautomatically enabled.\\nReview the security section of the MongoDB Atlas\\ndocumentation to learn more about each of the security\\nfeatures discussed below.\\nIP Whitelisting\\nClients are prevented from accessing the database unless\\ntheir IP address (or a CIDR covering their IP address) has\\nbeen added to the IP whitelist for your MongoDB Atlas\\ngroup.\\nVPC Peering\\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC) Peering allows users to create\\nan extended, private network that connects the AWS VPC\\nhousing their application servers with the VPC containing\\nthe backend databases. VPC peering achieves this\\nconnectivity without using public IP addresses, and without\\nneeding to whitelist every client in your MongoDB Atlas\\ngroup.\\nAuthorization\\nMongoDB Atlas allows administrators to define\\npermissions for a user or application, and what data it can\\naccess when querying MongoDB. MongoDB Atlas provides\\nthe ability to provision users with roles specific to a\\ndatabase, making it possible to realize a separation of\\nduties between different entities accessing and managing\\nthe data.\\nAtlas supports LDAP integration, allowing users to login to\\ndedicated Atlas clusters using credentials that are verified\\nby a centralized LDAP server. Authorization management is\\nsimplified by allowing control at the LDAP group level.\\nAdditionally, MongoDB's Aggregation Framework Pipeline\\nincludes a stage to implement Field-Level Redaction,\\nproviding a method to restrict the content of a returned\\ndocument on a per-field level, based on user permissions.\\n16\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4HkJP', 'page': 18}, page_content=\"The application must pass the redaction logic to the\\ndatabase on each request. It therefore relies on trusted\\nmiddleware running in the application to ensure the\\nredaction pipeline stage is appended to any query that\\nrequires the redaction logic.\\nEncryption\\nMongoDB Atlas provides encryption of data in flight over\\nthe network and at rest on disk.\\nSupport for SSL/TLS allows clients to connect to\\nMongoDB over an encrypted channel. Clients are defined\\nas any entity capable of connecting to MongoDB Atlas,\\nincluding:\\n• Users and administrators\\n• Applications\\n• MongoDB tools (e.g., mongodump, mongorestore)\\n• Nodes that make up a MongoDB Atlas cluster, such as\\nreplica set members and query routers.\\nAtlas provides encryption of data at rest with encrypted\\nstorage volumes.\\nOptionally, Atlas users can configure an additional layer of\\nencryption on their data at rest using the MongoDB\\nEncrypted Storage Engine and their Atlas-compatible key\\nmanagement service. Currently, Atlas integrates with AWS\\nKey Management Service and Azure Key Vault.\\nGranular Database Auditing\\nAtlas allows you to answer detailed questions about\\nsystem activity by tracking DDL, DML, and DCL\\ncommands. You can easily select the actions you want\\naudited as well as the MongoDB users, Atlas roles, or\\nLDAP groups you want to audit from the Atlas UI.\\nAlternatively, create an audit filter as a JSON string. The\\nauditing configuration applies to all dedicated clusters\\nwithin an Atlas project, and audit logs can be downloaded\\nin the UI or retrieved using the MongoDB Atlas API.\\nRead-Only, Redacted Views\\nDBAs can define non-materialized views that expose only a\\nsubset of data from an underlying collection, i.e. a view that\\nfilters out specific fields. DBAs can define a view of a\\ncollection that's generated from an aggregation over\\nanother collection(s) or view.\\nViews are defined using the standard MongoDB Query\\nLanguage and aggregation pipeline. They allow the\\ninclusion or exclusion of fields, masking of field values,\\nfiltering, schema transformation, grouping, sorting, limiting,\\nand joining of data using $lookup and $graphLookup to\\nanother collection.\\nYou can learn more about MongoDB read-only views from\\nthe documentation.\\nBusiness Intelligence with\\nMongoDB Atlas\\nBusiness Intelligence (BI) and analytics provides an\\nessential set of technologies and processes that\\norganizations have relied upon over many years to inform\\noperational insight and guide strategic business decisions.\\nMongoDB’s flexible data model and dynamic schema allow\\nyou to store data in rich, multi-dimensional documents to\\nquickly build and evolve your apps. However, your business\\nintelligence platforms expect fixed schemas and tabular\\ndata. To support these platforms, organizations often rely\\non developers to write and maintain complex extract,\\ntransform, and load (ETL) jobs. ETLs move data between\\ndisparate systems and manipulate its structure, but as new\\ndata is introduced, ETLs must be updated for compatibility.\\nIf updates do not happen in a timely fashion, teams are not\\nable to access their data to derive value, and in the worst\\ncase, these jobs can break, causing downtime.\\nThe MongoDB BI Connector for Atlas lets you use your\\nMongoDB Atlas cluster as a data source for SQL-based BI\\nand analytics platforms. Using the BI Connector for Atlas is\\na recommended best practice when:\\n• You need to simplify your BI architecture\\n• You would like to reduce reliance on complex and\\nfragile ETL jobs\\n17\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4HkJP', 'page': 19}, page_content=\"• You don't have the time or bandwidth to worry about\\nprovisioning, patching, and failover of BI middleware\\nThe BI Connector for Atlas allows you to connect to your\\nBI platform of choice such as Tableau, Qlik, Spotfire,\\nCognos, SAP Business Objects, Microstrategy, etc. You can\\nthen use these tool to seamlessly create visualizations and\\ndashboards that will help you extract the insights and\\nhidden value in your multi-structured data.\\nYou can learn more about the MongoDB BI Connector for\\nAtlas from our documentation.\\nConsiderations for Proofs of\\nConcept\\nGeneric benchmarks can be misleading and\\nmisrepresentative of a technology and how well it will\\nperform for a given application. MongoDB instead\\nrecommends that users model and benchmark their\\napplications using data, queries, instance sizes, and other\\naspects of the system that are representative of their\\nintended application. The following considerations will help\\nyou develop benchmarks that are meaningful for your\\napplication:\\n• Model your bencModel your benchmark on your applichmark on your applicationation: The\\nqueries, data, system configurations, and performance\\ngoals you test in a benchmark exercise should reflect\\nthe goals of your production system. Testing\\nassumptions that do not reflect your production system\\nis likely to produce misleading results.\\n• CrCreate ceate chunks beforhunks before loading, or use hash-basede loading, or use hash-based\\nsharshardingding: If range queries are part of your benchmark,\\nuse range-based sharding and create chunks before\\nloading. Without pre-splitting, data may be loaded into a\\nshard then moved to a different shard as the load\\nprogresses. By pre-splitting the data, documents will be\\nloaded in parallel into the appropriate shards. If your\\nbenchmark does not include range queries, you can use\\nhash-based sharding to ensure a uniform distribution of\\nwrites.\\n• Prime the system for several minutesPrime the system for several minutes: In a\\nproduction MongoDB system, the working set should fit\\nin RAM, and all reads and writes will be executed\\nagainst RAM. MongoDB must first fetch the working set\\ninto RAM, so prime the system with representative\\nqueries for several minutes before running the tests to\\nget an accurate sense for how MongoDB will perform in\\nproduction.\\n• Monitor everything to locMonitor everything to locate your bate your bottlenecottlenecksks: It is\\nimportant to understand the bottleneck for a\\nbenchmark. Depending on many factors any component\\nof the overall system could be the limiting factor. A\\nvariety of popular tools can be used with MongoDB –\\nmany are listed in the manual.\\nMongoDB Stitch: Serverless\\nPlatform From MongoDB\\nMongoDB Stitch is a serverless platform which accelerates\\napplication development with simple, secure access to data\\nand services from the client – getting your apps to market\\nfaster while reducing operational costs and effort.\\nThe Stitch serverless platform addresses the challenges\\nfaced by the developers of modern applications by\\nproviding four services:\\n• Stitch QueryAnywhere: Exposes the full power of\\nworking with documents in MongoDB and the\\nMongoDB query language, directly from your web and\\nmobile application frontend code.
