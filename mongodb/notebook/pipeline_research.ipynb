After posting the accounts in the ledger, a statement is prepared to show separately the debit and credit balances. Such a statement is known as the trial balance. It may also be prepared by listing each and every account and entering in separate columns the totals of the debit and credit sides. Whichever way it is prepared, the totals of the two columns should agree. An agreement indicates arithmetic accuracy of the accounting work; if the two sides do not agree, then there is simply an arithmetic error(s).\\nThis follows from the fact that under the Double Entry System, the amount written on the debit sides of various accounts is always equal to the amounts entered on the credit sides of other accounts and vice versa. Hence the totals of the debit sides must be equal to the totals of the credit sides. Also total of the debit balances will be equal to the total of the credit balances. Once this agreement is established, there is reasonable confidence that the accounting work is free from clerical errors, though it is not a proof of cent per cent accuracy, because some errors of principle and compensating errors may still remain. Generally, to check the arithmetic accuracy of accounts, trial balance is prepared at monthly intervals. But because double entry system is followed, one can prepare a trial balance any time. Though a trial balance can be prepared any time but it is preferable to prepare it at the end of the reporting period which may be month end/quarter end/year end to ensure the arithmetic accuracy of all the accounts before the preparation of the financial statements. It may be noted that trial balance is a statement and not an account.', 'OBJECTIVES OF PREPARING THE TRIAL BALANCE\\nThe preparation of trial balance has the following objectives:\\nTrial balance enables one to establish whether the posting and other accounting processes have been carried out without committing arithmetical errors. In other words, the trial balance helps to establish arithmetical accuracy of the books of accounts.\\nFinancial statements are normally prepared on the basis of agreed trial balance; otherwise the financial statements will not give true and fair picture of the financial transactions.\\nThe trial balance serves as a summary of what is contained in the ledger; the ledger may have to be seen only when details are required in respect of an account.\\nThe form of the trial balance is simple as shown below:\\nTrial Balance\\nas at…………….\\nSerial Number (S.No): This column enumerates the entries for reference and order.\\nLedger Accounts: This column lists the names of the accounts that have been affected by the transactions.\\nDebit Amount (Dr. Amount): This represents the total or balance amount that has been debited from the respective ledger accounts.\\nCredit Amount (Cr. Amount): This column shows the total or balance amount that has been credited to the respective ledger accounts. Each entry records the financial position of an account in terms of total debits and credits.\\nThe under mentioned points may be noted:\\nA trial balance is prepared as on a particular date which should be mentioned at the top.\\nIn the second column the name of the account is written.\\nIn the third column the total of the debit side of the account concerned or the debit balance, if any is entered.\\nIn the fourth column, the total of the credit side or the credit balance is written.\\n(v) The third and fourth columns are totalled at the end.', 'LIMITATIONS OF TRIAL BALANCE\\nOne should note that the agreement of Trial Balance is not a conclusive proof of accuracy. In other words, in spite of the agreement of the trial balance some errors may remain. These may be of the following types:\\nTransaction has not been entered at all in the journal.\\nA wrong amount has been written in both columns of the journal.\\nA wrong account has been mentioned in the journal.\\nAn entry has not at all been posted in the ledger.\\nEntry is posted twice in the ledger.\\nStill, the preparation of the trial balance is very useful; without it, the preparation of financial statements, would be difficult.', 'METHODS OF PREPARATION OF TRIAL BALANCE\\nTOTAL METHOD\\nUnder this method, every ledger account is totalled and that total amount (both of debit side and credit side) is transferred to trial balance. In this method, trial balance can be prepared as soon as ledger account is totalled. Time taken to balance the ledger accounts is saved under this method as balance can be found out in the trial balance itself. The difference of totals of each ledger account is the balance of that particular account. This method is not commonly used as for the preparation of the financial statements, only net balance of the ledger account is required. Therefore, the trial balance compiled under this method cannot be used directly for preparation of the financial statements.\\nBALANCE METHOD\\nUnder this method, every ledger account is balanced and those balances only are carried forward to the trial balance. This method is used commonly by the accountants and helps in the preparation of the financial statements. Financial statements are prepared on the basis of the balances of the ledger accounts.', 'METHODS OF PREPARATION OF TRIAL BALANCE\\nTOTAL AND BALANCE METHOD\\nUnder this method, the above two explained methods are combined. This has been explained with the help of the following example:\\nTrial Balance of  as at 31.03.2022\\nCash Account shows a debit balance of ₹7,500, with total debits amounting to ₹35,500 and credits totaling ₹28,000.\\nFurniture Account has a debit balance of ₹3,000, represented entirely by the total debits with no credits.\\nSalaries Account has a debit balance of ₹2,500, with no corresponding credit entries.\\nShyam’s Account has a credit balance of ₹3,500, with total debits of ₹21,500 and credits totaling ₹25,000.\\nPurchases Account records total debits of ₹26,000, with no credits, reflecting the total amount spent on purchases.\\nPurchase Returns Account has a credit balance of ₹500, indicating the value of purchases returned.\\nRam’s Account shows a credit balance of ₹25,100, with total debits of ₹4,900 against total credits of ₹30,000.\\nSales Account has a credit balance of ₹30,500, which is the total income from sales with no debits.\\nSale Returns Account records a debit balance of ₹100, signifying the amount in sales that was returned.\\nCapital Account shows a debit entry of ₹9,500 and a credit entry of ₹500, with a credit balance of ₹10,000.', 'ADJUSTED TRIAL BALANCE (THROUGH SUSPENSE ACCOUNT)\\nIf the trial balance does not agree after transferring the balance of all ledger accounts including cash and bank balance and also errors are not located timely, then the trial balance is tallied by transferring the difference of debit and credit side to an account known as suspense account. This is a temporary account opened to proceed further and to prepare the financial statements timely.', 'RULES OF PREPARING THE TRIAL BALANCE\\nWhile preparing the trial balance from the given list of ledger balances, following rules should be taken into account:\\nThe balances of all (i) assets accounts (ii) expenses accounts (iii) losses (iv) drawings are placed in the debit column of the trial balance.\\nThe balances of all (i) liabilities accounts (ii) income accounts (iii) gains (iv) capital are placed in the credit column of the trial balance.\\nNotes:\\nDues from customers is an asset, so its balance will be a debit balance.\\nPurchases return account always shows a credit balance because assets go out.\\nBalance in Trade payables is a liability, so its balance will be a credit balance.\\nBills payable is a liability, so its balance will be a credit balance.\\nInventory (opening) represents assets, so it will have a debit balance.\\nSales return account always shows a debit balance because assets come.', '']\n"

Primarily transactions and events are measured in terms of money. Any measurement discipline deals with three basic elements of measurement viz., identification of objects and events to be measured, selection of standard or scale to be used, and evaluation of dimension of measurement standards or scale.\\nProf. R. J. Chambers defined \\'measurement\\' as \"assignment of numbers to objects and events according to rules specifying the property to be measured, the scale to be used and the dimension of the unit\". (R.J. Chambers, Accounting Evaluation and Economic Behaviour, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 1966, P.10).\\nKohler defined measurement as the assignment of a system of ordinal or cardinal numbers to the results of a scheme of inquiry or apparatus of observations in accordance with logical or mathematical rules - [A Dictionary of Accountant].\\nOrdinal numbers, or ordinals, are numbers used to denote the position in an ordered sequence: first, second, third, fourth, etc., whereas a cardinal number says \\'how many there are\\': one, two, three, four, etc.\\nChambers\\' definition has been widely used to judge how far accounting can be treated as a measurement discipline.\\nAccording to this definition, the three elements of measurement are:\\nIdentification of objects and events to be measured;\\nSelection of standard or scale to be used;\\nEvaluation of dimension of measurement standard or scale.', \"OBJECTS OR EVENTS TO BE MEASURED\\nWe have earlier defined Accounting as the process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decisions by the users of the information. So accounting essentially includes measurement of 'information'.\\nDecision makers need past, present and future information. For external users, generally the past information is communicated.\\nThere is no uniform set of events and transactions in accounting which are required for decision making. For example, in cash management, various cash receipts and expenses are the necessary objects and events. Obviously, the decision makers need past cash receipts and expenses data along with projected receipts and expenses. For giving loan to a business one needs information regarding the repayment ability (popularly called debt servicing) of principal and interest. This also includes past information, current state of affairs as well as future projections. It may be mentioned that past and present objects and events can be measured with some degree of accuracy but future events and objects are only predicted, not measured. Prediction is an essential part of accounting information. Decision makers have to take decisions about the unseen future for which they need suitable information.\", 'STANDARD OR SCALE OF MEASUREMENT\\nIn accounting, money is the scale of measurement (see money measurement concept), although now-a- days quantitative information is also communicated along with monetary information.\\nMoney as a measurement scale has no universal denomination. It takes the shape of currency ruling in a country. For example, in India the scale of measurement is Rupee, in the U.K. Pound Sterling (  ), in Germany Deutschmark (DM), in the United States Dollar ($) and so on. Also there is no constant exchange relationship among the currencies.\\nIf one businessman in India took loan  from a businessman of the U.S.A., he would enter the transaction in his books in terms of ₹ Suppose at the time of loan agreement exchange rate was US . Then loan amounted to ₹ . Afterwards the exchange rate has been changed to . At the changed exchange rate the loan amount becomes₹ . So money as a unit of measurement lacks universal applicability across the boundary of a country unless a common currency is in vogue. Since the rate of exchange fluctuates between two currencies over the time, money as a measurement scale also becomes volatile.', 'DIMENSION OF MEASUREMENT SCALE\\nAn ideal measurement scale should be stable over time. For example, if one buys . cabbage today, the quantity he receives will be the same if he will buy . cabbage one year later. Similarly, length of 1 metre cloth will not change if it is bought a few days later. That is to say a measurement scale should be stable in dimension. Money as a scale of measurement is not stable. There occurs continuous change in the input output prices. The same quantity of money may not have the ability to buy same quantity of identical goods at different dates. Thus information of one year measured in money terms may not be comparable with that of another year. Suppose production and sales of a company in two different years are as follows:\\nIn Year 1, 5,000 pieces were valued at ₹5,00,000, while in Year 2, 4,500 pieces were valued at ₹5,40,000\\nLooking at the monetary figures one may be glad for  sales growth. In fact there was  production and sales decline. The growth envisaged through monetary figures is only due to price change. Let us suppose further that the cost of production for the above mentioned two years is as follows:\\nIn Year 1, the quantity was 5,000 pieces valued at ₹4,00,000; in Year 2, it was 4,500 pieces valued at ₹4,50,000.\\nTake Gross profit  Sales - Cost of Production. Then in the first year profit was ₹ 1,00,000 while in the second year the profit was ₹ 90,000 . There was  decline in gross profit.\\nSo, money as a unit of measurement is not stable in the dimension.\\nThus, Accounting measures information mostly in money terms which is not a stable scale having universal applicability and also not stable in dimension for comparison over the time. So it is not an exact measurement discipline.', \"ACCOUNTING AS A MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE\\nHow do you measure a transaction or an event? Unless the measurement base is settled we cannot progress to the record keeping function of book-keeping. It has been explained that accounting is meant for generating information suitable for users' judgments and decisions. But generation of such information is preceded by recording, classifying and summarising data. By that process it measures performance of the business entity by way of profit or loss and shows its financial position. Thus, measurement is an important part of accounting discipline. But a set of theorems governs the whole measurement sub- system. These theorems should be carefully understood to know how the cogs of the 'accounting-wheel' work. Now-a-days accounting profession earmarked three theorems namely going concern, consistency and accrual as fundamental accounting assumptions, i.e., these assumptions are taken for granted. Also while measuring, classifying, summarising and also presenting, various policies are adopted. Recording, classifying summarising and communication of information are also important part of accounting, which do not fall within the purview of measurement discipline. Therefore, we cannot simply say that accounting is a measurement discipline.\\nBut in accounting money is the unit of measurement. So, let us take one thing for granted that all transactions and events are to be recorded in terms of money only. Quantitative information is also required in many cases but such information is only supplementary to monetary information.\", 'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are:\\nHistorical Cost;\\nCurrent Cost:\\nRealizable Value;\\nPresent Value.\\nLet us discuss these principles in detail.\\nValuation Principles of Historical Cost: \\nIt means acquisition price. For example, the businessman paid  to purchase the machine and spend  on its installation, its acquisition price including installation charges is . The historical cost of machine would be ₹8,00,000.\\nAccording to this base, assets are recorded at an amount of cash or cash equivalent paid at the time of acquisition. Liabilities are recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business.\\nValuation Principles of Current Cost: \\nTake that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 at . As per historical cost base he has to record it at  i.e. the acquisition price. As on 1.1.2022, Mr. X found that it would cost ₹  to purchase that machine. Take also that Mr. X took loan from a bank as on 1.1.2011 ₹ 5,00,000 @ 18% p.a. repayable at the end of 15 th year together with interest. As on 1.1.2022 the bank announces  prepayment penalty on the loan amount if it is paid within 15 days starting from that day. As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000.\\nValuation Principles of Realisable Value: \\nSuppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently. Take also that Mr. X found that he had no money to pay off the bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 currently.\\nValuation Principles of Present Value: \\nSuppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference. Now think the machine purchased by Mr. X can work for another 10 years and is supposed to generate cash @ ₹ 1,00,000 p.a. Also take that bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 taken by Mr.  is to be repaid as on 31.12.2028. Annual interest is .', 'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are:\\nHistorical Cost;\\nCurrent Cost:\\nRealizable Value;\\nPresent Value.\\nLet us discuss these principles in detail.', 'Valuation Principles of Historical Cost: \\nIt means acquisition price. For example, the businessman paid  to purchase the machine and spend  on its installation, its acquisition price including installation charges is . The historical cost of machine would be ₹8,00,000.\\nAccording to this base, assets are recorded at an amount of cash or cash equivalent paid at the time of acquisition. Liabilities are recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business.\\nWhen a businessman, takes ₹ 5,00,000 loan from a bank @ 10% interest p.a., it is to be recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. Here the obligation is the repayment of loan as well as payment of interest at an agreed rate i.e. . Proceeds received are  - it is historical cost of the transactions.\\nTake another case regarding payment of income tax liability. You know every individual has to pay income tax on his income if it exceeds certain minimum limit. But the income tax liability is not settled immediately when one earns his income. The income tax authority settles it some time later, which is technically called assessment year. Then how does he record this liability? As per historical cost base it is to be recorded at an amount expected to be paid to discharge the liability.\\nCompanies usually apply historical cost method in case of long-term assets like machinery, furniture, licenses etc.', 'Valuation Principles of Current Cost: \\nTake that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 at . As per historical cost base he has to record it at  i.e. the acquisition price. As on 1.1.2022, Mr. X found that it would cost ₹  to purchase that machine. Take also that Mr. X took loan from a bank as on 1.1.2011 ₹ 5,00,000 @ 18% p.a. repayable at the end of 15 th year together with interest. As on 1.1.2022 the bank announces  prepayment penalty on the loan amount if it is paid within 15 days starting from that day. As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000.\\nCurrent cost gives an alternative measurement base. Assets are carried out at the amount of cash or cash equivalent that would have to be paid if the same or an equivalent asset was acquired currently. Liabilities are carried at the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents that would be required to settle the obligation currently.\\nSo as per current cost base, the machine value is  while the value of bank loan is ₹ 5,05,000.', 'Valuation Principles of Realisable Value: \\nSuppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently. Take also that Mr. X found that he had no money to pay off the bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 currently.\\nAs per realisable value, assets are carried at the amount of cash or cash equivalents that could currently be obtained by selling the assets in an orderly disposal. Haphazard disposal may yield something less. Liabilities are carried at their settlement values; i.e. the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents expressed to be paid to satisfy the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nSo, the machine should be recorded at ₹  the realisable value in an orderly sale while the bank loan should be recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 the settlement value in the normal course of business.\\nRealisable value concept is commonly applied in case of inventories. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.', \"Valuation Principles of Present Value: \\nSuppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference. Now think the machine purchased by Mr. X can work for another 10 years and is supposed to generate cash @ ₹ 1,00,000 p.a. Also take that bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 taken by Mr.  is to be repaid as on 31.12.2028. Annual interest is .\\nAs per present value, an asset is carried at the present discounted value of the future net cash inflows that the item is expected to generate in the normal course of business. Liabilities are carried at the present discounted value of future net cash outflows that are expected to be required to settle the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nThe concept of Present Value is common in case of accounting for investments and loans.\\nThe term 'discount', 'cash inflow' and 'cash outflow' need a little elaboration. ₹ 100 in hand as on 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 in hand as on 31.12.2022. There is a time gap of one year. If Mr. X had ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 he could use it at that time. If he received it only on 31.12.2022, he had to sacrifice his use for a year. The value of this sacrifice is called 'time value of money'. Mr.  would sacrifice i.e. he would agree to take money on 31.12.2022 if he had been compensated for the sacrifice. So a rational man will never exchange ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 with ₹ 100 to be received on 31.12.2022. Then ₹ 100 of 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 of 31.12.2022. To make the money receivable at a future date equal with the money of the present date it is to be devalued. Such devaluation is called discounting of future money.\\nPerhaps you know the compound interest rule: \\n Amount\\n Principal\\n interest \\n Time\\nThis equation gives the relationship between present money, principal and the future money amount. If  and  are given, to find out , the equation is to be changed slightly.\\n\\nUsing the equation one can find out the present value if he knows the values of  and .\\nSuppose , now what is the present value of  to be received as on 31.12.2022 (Take 1.1.2022 as the time of reference).\\n\\nSimilarly,\\nOn 31.12.2023, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹69,444.\\nOn 31.12.2024, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹57,870.\\nOn 31.12.2025, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹48,225.\\nOn 31.12.2026, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹40,188.\\nOn 31.12.2027, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹33,490.\\nOn 31.12.2028, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹27,908.\\nOn 31.12.2029, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹23,257.\\nOn 31.12.2030, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹19,381.\\nOn 31.12.2031, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹16,150. \\u200b\\nTotal of all these present values is ₹ 4,19,246. Since the machine purchased by Mr. X will produce cash equivalent to ₹ 4,19,246 in terms of present value, it is to be valued at such amount as per present value measurement basis.\\nHere, Mr.  will receive  at different points of time-these are cash inflows. In the other example, he has to pay interest and principal of bank loan-these are cash outflows.\\nPerhaps you also know the annuity rule:\\nPresent value of an Annuity or Re. A for  periods is\\nA = Annuity\\n interest\\n time , n.\\n\\nApplying this rule one can derive the present value of ₹ 1,00,000 for 10 years @ 20% p.a.\\n\\nSimilarly, the present value of bank loan is\\n\\n\\nThus, we get the four measurements as on 1.1.2022:\\nThe machine asset has a historical cost of ₹7,00,000, a current cost of ₹25,00,000, a realisable value of ₹20,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,19,246. The bank loan liability has a historical cost of ₹5,00,000, a current cost of ₹5,05,000, a realisable value of ₹5,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,70,094. \\u200b\\u200b\\nThe accounting system which we shall discuss in the remaining chapters is also called historical cost accounting. However, this need not mean that one shall follow only historical cost basis of accounting. In the later stages of the CA course, we shall see that the accounting system uses all types of measurement bases although under the traditional system most of the transactions and events are measured in terms of historical cost.\", 'MEASUREMENT AND VALUATION\\nValue relates to the benefits to be derived from objects, abilities or ideas. To the economist, value is the utility (i.e.; satisfaction) of an economic resource to the person contemplating or enjoying its use. In accounting, to mean value of an object, abilities or ideas, a monetary surrogate is used. That is to say, value is measured in terms of money. Suppose, an individual purchased a car paying . Its value lies in the satisfaction to be derived by that individual using the car in future. Economists often use ordinal scale to indicate the level of satisfaction. But accountants use only cardinal scales. If the value of car is taken as ₹ 2,50,000 it is only one type of value called acquisition cost or historical cost. So value is indicated by measurement. In accounting the value is always measured in terms of money.', 'ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\\nEarlier in this unit we have learned how to measure a transaction, which had already taken place and for which either some value/money has been paid or some valuation principles are to be adopted for their measurement. But there are certain items, which have not occurred therefore cannot be measured using valuation principles still they are necessary to record in the books of account, for example, provision for doubtful debts. For such items, we need some value. In such a situation reasonable estimates based on the existing situation and past experiences are made.\\nThe measurement of certain assets and liabilities is based on estimates of uncertain future events. As a result of the uncertainties inherent in business activities, many financial statement items cannot be measured with precision but can only be estimated. Therefore, the management makes various estimates and assumptions of assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses as on the date of preparation of financial statements. Such estimates are made in connection with the computation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses as well as, accruals, provisions and employee benefit obligations. Also estimates may be required in determining the bad debts, useful life and residual value of an item of plant and machinery and inventory obsolescence. The process of estimation involves judgements based on the latest information available.\\nAn estimate may require revision if changes occur regarding circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of new information, more experience or subsequent developments. Change in accounting estimate means difference arises between certain parameters estimated earlier and re-estimated during the current period or actual result achieved during the current period.\\nFew examples of situations wherein accounting estimates are needed can be given as follows:\\nA company incurs expenditure of  on development of patent. Now the company has to estimate that for how many years the patent would benefit the company. This estimation should be based on the latest information and logical judgement.\\nA company dealing in long-term construction contracts, uses percentage of completion method for recognizing the revenue at the end of the accounting year. Under this method the company has to make adequate provisions for unseen contingencies, which can take place while executing the remaining portion of the contract. Since provisioning for unseen contingencies requires estimation, there may be excess or short provisioning, which is to be adjusted in the period when it is recognised.\\nA company has to provide for taxes which is also based on estimation as there can be some interpretational differences on account of which tax authorities may either accept the expenditure or refuse it. This will ultimately lead to different tax liability.\\nCompany XY Ltd purchases a machine for ₹ 10 lac in 2021. The procurement head suggested that the machine is expected to offer benefits up to next 10 years. After 3 years of its use, the machine has become obsolete as new technologies are now available providing better productivity than the existing machine. Hence, it is now expected that the machine can only offer benefits for further 3 years. This is a change in estimate in the useful life of the machine.']\n",

For ascertaining the periodical business results, the nature of transactions should be analyzed whether they are of capital or revenue nature. Revenue Expense relates to the operations of the business of an accounting period or to the revenue earned during the period or the items of expenditure, benefits of which do not extend beyond that period. Capital Expenditure, on the other hand, generates enduring benefits and helps in revenue generation over more than one accounting period. Revenue Expenses must be associated with a physical activity of the entity. Therefore, whereas production and sales generate revenue in the earning process, use of goods and services in support of those functions causes expenses to occur.\\nExpenses are recognised in the Profit & Loss Account through matching principal which tells us when and how much of the expenses to be charged against revenue. A part of the expenditure can be capitalised only when these can be traced directly to definable streams of future benefits.\\nThe distinction of transaction into revenue and capital is done for the purpose of placing them in Profit and Loss account or in the Balance Sheet. For example: revenue expenditures are shown in the profit and loss account as their benefits are for one accounting period i.e., in which they are incurred while capital expenditures are placed on the asset side of the balance sheet as they will generate benefits for more than one accounting period and will be transferred to profit and loss account of the year on the basis of utilisation of that benefit in particular accounting year. Hence, both capital and revenue expenditures are ultimately transferred to profit and loss account.\\nRevenue expenditures are transferred to profit and loss account in the year of spending while capital expenditures are transferred to profit and loss account of the year in which their benefits are utilised. Therefore, we can conclude that it is the time factor, which is the main determinant for transferring the expenditure to profit and loss account. Also, expenses are recognized in profit and loss account through matching concept which tells us when and how much of the expenses to be charged against revenue. However, distinction between capital and revenue creates a considerable difficulty. In many cases borderline between the two is very thin.', 'CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINING CAPITAL AND REVENUE EXPENDITURES\\nThe basic considerations in distinction between capital and revenue expenditures are:\\nNature of business: For a trader dealing in furniture, purchase of furniture is revenue expenditure but for any other trade, the purchase of furniture should be treated as capital expenditure and shown in the balance sheet as asset. Therefore, the nature of business is a very important criteria in separating an expenditure between capital and revenue.\\nRecurring nature of expenditure: If the frequency of an expense is quite often in an accounting year then it is said to be an expenditure of revenue nature while nonrecurring expenditure is infrequent in nature and do not occur often in an accounting year. Monthly salary or rent is the example of revenue expenditure as they are incurred every month while purchase of assets is not the transaction done regularly therefore, classified as capital expenditure unless materiality criteria defines it as revenue expenditure.\\nPurpose of expenses: Expenses for repairs of machine may be incurred in course of normal maintenance of the asset. Such expenses are revenue in nature. On the other hand, expenditure incurred for major repair of the asset so as to increase its productive capacity is capital in nature. However, determination of the cost of maintenance and ordinary repairs which should be expensed, as opposed to a cost which ought to be capitalised, is not always simple.\\nEffect on revenue generating capacity of business: The expenses which help to generate income/ revenue in the current period are revenue in nature and should be matched against the revenue earned in the current period. On the other hand, if expenditure helps to generate revenue over more than one accounting period, it is generally called capital expenditure.\\nWhen expenditure on improvements and repair of a fixed asset is done, it has to be charged to Profit and Loss Account if the expected future benefits from fixed assets do not change, and it will be included in book value of fixed asset, where the expected future benefits from assets increase.\\nMateriality of the amount involved: Relative proportion of the amount involved is another important consideration in distinction between revenue and capital.', 'CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND REVENUE EXPENDITURES\\nAs we have already discussed, capital expenditure contributes to the revenue earning capacity of a business over more than one accounting period whereas revenue expense is incurred to generate revenue for a particular accounting period. The revenue expenses either occur in direct relation with the revenue or in relation with accounting periods, for example cost of goods sold, salaries, rent, etc. Cost of goods sold is directly related to sales revenue whereas rent is related to the particular accounting period. Capital expenditure may represent acquisition of any tangible or intangible fixed assets for enduring future benefits. Therefore, the benefits arising out of capital expenditure last for more than one accounting period whereas those arising out of revenue expenses expire in the same accounting period.', 'Key differences between Capital and Revenue Expenditures\\nPeriod of benefit: Capital expenditure is any expenditure incurred to provide a benefit over a long-term period. Revenue expenditure is any expenditure incurred to provide a benefit during the current period.\\nEnhancement vs Maintenance: Capital expenditure is incurred for the purpose of increasing the capacity of the business or to reduce the costs of the business. Revenue expenditure is incurred to maintain the earning capacity of the business.\\nExamples: Capital expenditure includes purchases of machines, cars, furniture, etc. Revenue expenditure includes repairs and maintenance, salaries of accounting staff, etc.', \"CAPITAL RECEIPTS AND REVENUE RECEIPTS\\nJust as a clear distinction between Capital and Revenue expenditure is necessary, in the same manner capital receipts must be distinguished from revenue receipts.\\nReceipts which are obtained in course of normal business activities are revenue receipts (e.g., receipts from sale of goods or services, interest income etc.). On the other hand, receipts which are not revenue in nature are capital receipts (e.g., receipts from sale of fixed assets or investments, secured or unsecured loans, owners' contributions etc.). Revenue and capital receipts are recognised on accrual basis as soon as the right of receipt is established. Revenue receipts should not be equated with the actual cash receipts. Revenue receipts are credited to the Profit and Loss Account.\\nOn the other hand, Capital receipts are not directly credited to Profit and Loss Account. For example, when a fixed asset is sold for ₹ 92,000 (cost ₹ 90,000), the capital receipts ₹ 92,000 is not credited to Profit and Loss Account. Profit or Loss on sale of fixed assets is calculated and credited to Profit and Loss Account,\\nSale Proceeds                                    ₹ 92,000\\nCost                                                   (₹ 90,000)\\nProfit                                                   ₹ 2,000\"]\n",

It usually arises from unplanned or unexpected events that give rise to the possibility of an inflow of economic benefits to the business entity. For example, a claim that an enterprise is pursuing through legal process, where the outcome is uncertain, is a contingent asset.\\nAs per the concept of prudence as well as the present accounting standards, an enterprise should not recognise a contingent asset. These assets are uncertain and may arise from a claim which an enterprise pursues through a legal proceeding. There is uncertainty in realisation of claim. It is possible that recognition of contingent assets may result in recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset no longer remains as contingent asset.\\nA contingent asset need not be disclosed in the financial statements. A contingent asset is usually disclosed in the report of the approving authority (Board of Directors in the case of a company, and the corresponding approving authority in the case of any other enterprise), if an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and if it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change occurs.', 'CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\\nThe term \\'Contingent liability\\' can be defined as\\na possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise; or\\na present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:\\nit is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or\\na reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made.\"\\nFor example- Mr. X sells a machine to Mr. Y. Any damages incurred by Mr. Y while using the machine need to be compensated by Mr. X. A few days later from the date of sale of machine, Mr.  received a notice from Mr. Y who is claiming damages of ₹ 20 lac. The notice mentioned that a worker met with an accident during the use of the machine and is required to be compensated.\\nThe receipt of this notice does not suggest that Mr. X is liable to pay the amount, although this needs to be investigated and confirmed, as whether the damage arose due to any defect in the machine or it is due to negligence while operating the machine. Although, the receipt of the notice results into an event which requires recognition of a contingent liability since there is a possible obligation, and that can only be confirmed in future.\\nTaking another example let us assume Mr. AB sells cars to its customers. One of the cars caught fire due to malfunctioning of a faulty part during the test drive by one of the customers. The customer has filed a court case seeking a claim of ₹ 50 lac due to the incidence.\\nWhile Mr. AB acknowledges that there is a present obligation, it is not certain that whether he is expected to pay for any damages. The final outcome will only be known during the court proceedings.\\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and may arise in future depending on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events [part (a) of the definition]. A contingent liability may also be a present obligation that arises from past events [(part (b) of the definition)].\\nAn enterprise should not recognise a contingent liability in balance sheet, however it is required to be disclosed in the notes to accounts, unless possibility of outflow of a resource embodying economic benefits is remote. These liabilities are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits has become probable.\\nIf it becomes probable that an outflow or future economic benefits will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognised in financial statements of the period in which the change in probability occurs except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made.', 'DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND LIABILITIES\\nThe distinction between a liability and a contingent liability is generally based on the judgement of the management. A liability is defined as the present financial obligation of an enterprise, which arises from past events. The settlement of a liability results in an outflow from the enterprises of resources embodying economic benefits. On the other hand, in the case of contingent liability, either outflow of resources to settle the obligation is not probable or the amount expected to be paid to settle the liability cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\\nExamples of contingent liabilities are claims against the enterprise not acknowledged as debts, guarantees given in respect of third parties, liability in respect of bills discounted and statutory liabilities under dispute etc. In addition to present obligations that are recognized as liabilities in the balance sheet, enterprises are required to disclose contingent liability in their balance sheets by way of notes.', 'DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS\\nProvision means \"any amount written off or retained by way of providing for depreciation, renewal or diminution in the value of assets or retained by way of providing for any known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with substantial accuracy\".\\nIt is important to know the difference between provisions and contingent liabilities. The distinction between both of them can be explained as follows:\\nProvision is a present liability of uncertain amount that can be reliably measured using substantial estimation, whereas a contingent liability is a potential obligation dependent on uncertain future events.\\nA provision satisfies the recognition criteria, while a contingent liability does not meet these criteria.\\nProvision is acknowledged when there is a current obligation from past events likely to result in an economic benefit outflow, and the amount can be reliably estimated; in contrast, a contingent liability includes obligations not recognized due to uncertainty in benefit outflow or amount estimation.\\nManagement recognizes a provision in the balance sheet if it is probable that fulfilling an obligation will result in economic benefits outflow; conversely, if economic benefits outflow is unlikely, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability. \\u200b\\nLet us take an example to understand the distinction between provisions and contingent liabilities. The Central Excise Officer imposes a penalty on Alpha Ltd. for violation of a provision in the Central Excise Act. The company goes on an appeal. If the management of the company estimates that it is probable that the company will have to pay the penalty, it recognises a provision for the liability. On the other hand, if the management anticipates that the judgement of the appellate authority will be in its favour and it is less likely that the company will have to pay the penalty, it will disclose the obligation as a contingent liability instead of recognising a provision for the same.']\n",

A salaried person gets salary and spends to buy provisions and clothing, for children's education, construction of house, etc. A sports club formed by a group of individuals, a business run by an individual or a group of individuals, a company running a business in telecom sector, a local authority like Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Delhi Development Authority, Governments, either Central or State, all are carrying some kind of economic activities. Not necessarily all the economic activities are run for any individual benefit; such economic activities may create social benefit i.e. benefit for the public, at large. Anyway, such economic activities are performed through 'transactions and events'. Transaction is used to mean 'a business, performance of an act, an agreement' while event is used to mean 'a happening, as a consequence of transaction(s), a result.'\", 'MEANING OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe Committee on Terminology set up by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants formulated the following definition of accounting in 1961:\\n\"Accounting is the art of recording, classifying, and summarising in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of a financial character, and interpreting the result thereof.\"\\nAs per this definition, accounting is simply an art of record keeping. The process of accounting starts by first identifying the events and transactions which are of financial character and then be recorded in the books of account. Continuing with the same example of the telecom company, which needs to capture all transactions (transactions made by the user, raising invoice to the customer, receipt of money, payment towards salaries, marketing etc.). Likewise, the individual running the stationery business, would need to record all business transactions.\\nThis recording is done in Journal or subsidiary books, also known as primary books. Every good record keeping system includes suitable classification of transactions and events as well as their summarisation for ready reference. For example, the telecom company performing thousands of transactions on a daily basis, is not expected to publish all those transactions for the users to be able to make a decision. Surely, those transactions need to be summarized appropriately.\\nAfter the transactions and events are recorded, they are transferred to secondary books, i.e., Ledger. In ledger, transactions and events are classified in terms of income, expense, assets and liabilities according to their characteristics and summarised in profit and loss account and balance sheet.\\nEssentially the transactions and events are to be measured in terms of money. Measurement in terms of money means measuring at the ruling currency of a country, for example, rupee in India, dollar in U.S.A. and like. The transactions and events must have at least in part, financial characteristics. The inauguration of a new branch of a bank is an event without having financial character, while the business disposed of by the branch is an event having financial character. Accounting also interprets the recorded, classified and summarized transactions and events. However, the above-mentioned definition does not reflect the present day accounting function. According to the above definition, accounting ends with interpretation of the results of the financial transactions and events but in the modern world with the diversification of management and ownership, globalization of business and society gaining more interest in the functioning of the enterprises, the importance of communicating the accounting results has increased.\\nTherefore, this requirement of communicating and motivating informed judgement has also become the part of accounting as defined in the widely accepted definition of accounting, given by the American Accounting Association in 1966 which treated accounting as:\\n\"The process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgments and decisions by the users of accounts.\"\\nIn 1970, the Accounting Principles Board (APB) of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) enumerated the functions of accounting as follows:\\n\"The function of accounting is to provide quantitative information, primarily of financial nature, about economic entities, that is needed to be useful in making economic decisions.\"\\nThus, accounting may be defined as the process of recording, classifying, summarising, analysing and interpreting the financial transactions and communicating the results thereof to the persons interested in such information.\\nThe above definition requires accountants to assume a bigger responsibility than to merely do book-keeping. Accountants need to be ready to provide the information ready for the intended users to be able to make economic decisions.', 'Procedural aspects of Accounting\\nOn the basis of the above definitions, procedure of accounting can be basically divided into two parts:\\nGenerating financial information and\\nUsing the financial information.\\nGenerating Financial Information\\nRecording - This is the basic function of accounting. All business transactions of a financial character, as evidenced by some documents such as sales bill, pass book, salary slip etc. are recorded in the books of account. Recording is done in a book called \"Journal.\" This book may further be divided into several subsidiary books according to the nature and size of the business. Students will learn how to prepare journal and various subsidiary books in chapter 2.\\nClassifying - Classification is concerned with the systematic analysis of the recorded data, with a view to group transactions or entries of one nature at one place so as to put information in compact and usable form. The book containing classified information is called \"Ledger\". This book contains on different pages, individual account heads under which, all financial transactions of similar nature are collected. For example, there may be separate account heads for Salaries, Rent, Printing and Stationeries, Advertisement etc. All expenses under these heads, after being recorded in the Journal, will be classified under separate heads in the Ledger. This will help in finding out the total expenditure incurred under each of the above heads. Students will learn how to prepare ledger books in chapter 2.\\nSummarising - It is concerned with the preparation and presentation of the classified data in a manner useful to the internal as well as the external users of financial statements. This process leads to the preparation of the financial statements.\\nAnalysing - The term \\'Analysis\\' means methodical classification of the data given in the financial statements. The figures given in the financial statements will not help anyone unless they are in a simplified form. For example, all items relating to fixed assets are put at one place while all items relating to current assets are put at another place. It is concerned with the establishment of relationship between the items of the Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet i.e. it provides the basis for interpretation. Students will learn this aspect of financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course.\\nInterpreting - This is the final function of accounting. It is concerned with explaining the meaning and significance of the relationship as established by the analysis of accounting data. The recorded financial data is analysed and interpreted in a manner that will\\nenable the end-users to make a meaningful judgement about the financial condition and profitability of the business operations. The financial statement should explain not only what had happened but also why it happened and what is likely to happen under specified conditions.\\nCommunicating - It is concerned with the transmission of summarised, analysed and interpreted information to the end-users to enable them to make rational decisions. This is done through preparation and distribution of accounting reports, which include besides the usual profit and loss account and the balance sheet, additional information in the form of accounting ratios, graphs, diagrams, fund flow statements etc. Students will learn this aspect of financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course.\\nThe first two procedural stages of the process of generating financial information along with the preparation of trial balance are covered under book-keeping while the preparation of financial statements and its analysis, interpretation and also its communication to the various users are considered as accounting stages. Students will learn the term book-keeping and its distinction with accounting, in the coming topics of this unit.', \"Using the Financial Information\\nThere are certain users of accounts. Earlier it was viewed that accounting is meant for the proprietor or owner of the business, but changing social relationships diluted the earlier thinking. Since earlier businesses were simple and not scaled, probably that view could hold true for those.\\nIt is now believed that besides the owner or the management of the business enterprise, users of accounts include the investors, employees, lenders, suppliers, customers, government and other agencies and the public at large. For example, if an airlines company borrows money from a bank, buys oil from oil companies, sells tickets to the customers, has staff to be paid salaries to, all these group of people and entities are key stakeholders in that airlines business. They would like to know and understand whether the business of the company is going well or there are challenges for the company to run the business. Accounting provides the art of presenting information systematically to the users of accounts.\\nAccounting data is more useful if it stresses economic substance rather than technical form. Information is useless and meaningless unless it is relevant and material to a user's decision. The information should also be free of any biases. The users should understand not only the financial results depicted by the accounting figures, but also should be able to assess its reliability and compare it with information about alternative opportunities and the past experience. The owners or the management of the enterprise, commonly known as internal users, use the accounting information in an analytical manner to take the valuable decisions for\\nthe business. So the information served to them is presented in a manner different to the information presented to the external users. Even the small details which can affect the internal working of the business are given in the management report while financial statements presented to the external users contains key information regarding assets, liabilities and capital which are summarised in a logical manner that helps them in their respective decision-making.\", \"EVOLUTION OF ACCOUNTING AS A SOCIAL SCIENCE\\nHistory & Development of Accounting\\nAccounting finds its roots as early as around 4000 BC, where Egyptians used some form of accounting for their treasuries. The in-charge of treasuries had to send day wise reports to their superiors known as Wazirs and monthly reports were sent to kings. Babylonia, known as the city of commerce, used accounting for business to identify the losses that took place due to frauds and lack of efficiency. Greece used accounting to divide the revenues received among treasuries, maintaining receipts, payments and balance of government financial transactions. Romans used memorandum or daybook where in receipts and payments were recorded. (700 B.C to 400 A.D).\\nChina used sophisticated form of government accounting as early as 2000 B.C. Accounting practices in India could be traced back to a period where, Kautilya, a minister in Chandragupta's kingdom wrote a book named Arthashasthra, which also described how accounting records had to be maintained.\\nLuca Pacioli's, a Franciscan friar (merchant class), book Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportion at Proportionality (Review of Arithmetic and Geometric proportions) in Venice (1494) is considered as the first book on double entry bookkeeping. A portion of this book contains knowledge of business and book-keeping. He used the terms Debit (Dr.) and Credit (Cr.) in his books. These were the concepts used in Italian terminology. Debit comes from the Italian debito which comes from the Latin debita and debeo which means owed to the proprietor. Credit comes from the Italian credito which comes from the Latin 'credo' which means trust or belief (in the proprietor or owed by the proprietor.\\nIn explaining double entry system, Pacioli wrote that 'All entries... have to be double entries, that is if you make one creditor, you must make some debtor'. He also mentioned that a merchant's responsibility is to give glory to God in their enterprises, to be ethical in all business activities and to earn a profit. He discussed the details of memorandum, journal, ledger and specialised accounting procedures.\\nIn its oldest form, accounting aided the stewards to discharge their stewardship function. The wealthy men employed stewards to manage their property; the stewards in turn rendered an account periodically of their stewardship. This 'Stewardship Accounting' was the root of financial accounting system. Although double-entry system was followed, 'stewardship accounting' served the purpose of businessmen and wealthy persons at that time. In most of the countries, stewardship accounting was prevalent till the emergence of large-scale enterprises in the form of public limited companies.\\nIn the second phase, the idea of financial accounting emerged with the concept of joint stock company and divorce of ownership from the management. To safeguard the interest of the shareholders and investors, disclosure of financial statements (mainly, profit and loss account and balance sheet) and other accounting information was moulded by law. Financial statements give periodic performance report by way of profit and loss account and financial position at the end of the period by way of Balance Sheet. It got the legal status due to changing relationships between the owners, economic entity and the managers. With the democratisation of society, the relationships between the enterprise on the one hand, the investors, employees, managers and governments on the other, have also undergone a seachange. Also, the prospective investors and other business contact groups want to know a lot about the business before entering into transactions. Thus, financial accounting emerged as an information system to identify, measure and communicate useful information for informed judgements and decisions by a broad group of users. In the third phase, accounting information was generated to aid management decision- making in particular. It contributed a lot to improve the quality of management decisions. This new dimension of accounting is called Management Accounting and it is the development of 20th Century only. It is pervasive enough to cover all spheres of management decisions.\\nLastly, Social Responsibility Accounting is in the formative process, which aims at accounting for the social cost incurred by business as well as the social benefit, created by it. It emerges from the growing social awareness about the undesirable by-products of economic activities. While earning profit, an enterprise incurs numerous social costs like pollution, using the resources of society like materials, land, labour etc. To compensate for this social cost, in today's world, an enterprise is expected to generate some social benefits also like employment opportunities, recreation activities, more choice to customers at reasonable price, better quality products etc. Therefore, it is demanded that the accounting system should produce a report measuring the social cost incurred and social benefits generated.\\nSocial Science study man as a member of society; they concern about social processes and the results and consequences of social relationships. The usefulness of accounting to society as a whole is the fundamental criterion to treat it as a social science. Although individuals may benefit from the availability of accounting information, the accounting system generates information for social good. It serves social purpose, it contributes for social progress; also it is being adapted to keep pace with social progress. So, accounting is treated as a social science.\", \"OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe objectives of accounting can be given as follows:\\nSystematic recording of transactions - Basic objective of accounting is to systematically record the financial aspects of business transactions, i.e., book-keeping. These recorded transactions are later on classified and summarized logically for the preparation of financial statements and for their analysis and interpretation.\\nAscertainment of results of above recorded transactions - Accountant prepares profit and loss account to know the results of business operations for a particular period of time. If revenue (Sales) exceeds expenses then it is said that business is running profitably but if expenses exceed revenue, then it can be said that business is running under loss. The profit and loss account helps the management and different stakeholders in taking rational decisions. For example, if business is not proved to be remunerative or profitable, the cause of such a state of affair can be investigated by the management for taking remedial steps.\\nAscertainment of the financial position of the business - A businessman is not only interested in knowing the results of the business in terms of profits or loss for a particular period but is also anxious to know that what he owes (liability) to the outsiders and what he owns (assets) on a certain date. To know this, accountant prepares a financial position statement popularly known as Balance Sheet. The balance sheet is a statement of assets and liabilities of the business at a particular point of time and helps in ascertaining the financial health of the business.\\nProviding information to the users for rational decision-making - Accounting as a 'language of business' communicates the financial results of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. Accounting aims to meet the information needs of the decision-makers and helps them in rational decision-making.\\nTo know the solvency position - By preparing the balance sheet, management not only reveals what is owned and owed by the enterprise, but also it gives the information regarding concern's ability to meet its liabilities in the short run (liquidity position) and also in the long-run (solvency position) as and when they fall due.\", 'An overview of objectives of accounting is depicted  below:\\nObjectives of Accounting\\nAccounting aims to fulfill several key objectives, which are essential for the proper management and financial transparency of a business or organization:\\nSystematic Recording of Transactions: The foundation of accounting is the methodical recording of all business transactions. This is achieved through the process of bookkeeping, which utilizes tools such as:\\nJournal: A chronological record of all transactions.\\nLedger: A set of accounts where transactions are categorized.\\nTrial Balance: A statement that ensures that the sum of debits equals the sum of credits, verifying the mathematical accuracy of the bookkeeping.\\nAscertainment of Results: Accounting helps in determining the operational outcome of a business over a period, usually in terms of profit or loss. This is done through:\\nManufacturing Account: A statement showing the cost of production.\\nTrading Account: A summary of the trading activities, showing the gross profit or loss.\\nProfit and Loss Account: An account that details the expenses and revenues, culminating in the net profit or loss.\\nAscertainment of Financial Position: Through accounting, a business can determine its financial standing at a specific point in time. This objective is primarily achieved by preparing:\\nBalance Sheet: A financial statement that lists assets, liabilities, and equity, depicting the financial position of the business.\\nCommunicating Information to Various Users: Accounting serves to communicate financial information to a diverse set of users, which is crucial for decision-making. The information is disseminated through:\\nFinancial Reports: Documents such as income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and equity statements that provide detailed financial information to stakeholders.\\nThese objectives are integral to the discipline of accounting, ensuring that all financial information is recorded accurately, results are clearly ascertained, financial positions are transparent, and information is effectively communicated to all relevant stakeholders.', 'Top of Form\\nFUNCTIONS OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe main functions of accounting are as follows:\\nMeasurement: Accounting measures past performance of the business entity and depicts its current financial position.\\nForecasting: Accounting helps in forecasting future performance and financial position of the enterprise using past data and analysing trends.\\nDecision-making: Accounting provides relevant information to the users of accounts to aid rational decision-making.\\nComparison & Evaluation: Accounting assesses performance achieved in relation to targets and discloses information regarding accounting policies and contingent liabilities which play an important role in predicting, comparing and evaluating the financial results.\\nControl: Accounting also identifies weaknesses of the operational system and provides feedbacks regarding effectiveness of measures adopted to check such weaknesses.\\nGovernment Regulation and Taxation: Accounting provides necessary information to the government to exercise control on the entity as well as in collection of tax revenues.', \"BOOK-KEEPING\\nBook-keeping is an activity concerned with the recording of financial data relating to business operations in a significant and orderly manner. It covers procedural aspects of accounting work and embraces record keeping function. Obviously, book-keeping procedures are governed by the end product, the financial statements. The term 'financial statements' means Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet and cash flow statements including Schedules and Notes forming part of Accounts.\\nBook-keeping also requires suitable classification of transactions and events. This is also determined with reference to the requirement of financial statements. A book-keeper may be responsible for keeping all the records of a business or only of a minor segment, such as position of the customers' accounts in a departmental store. Accounting is based on a careful and efficient book-keeping system.\\nThe essential idea behind maintaining book-keeping records is to show correct position regarding each head of income and expenditure. A business may purchase goods on credit as well as in cash. When the goods are bought on credit, a record must be kept of the person to whom money is owed. The proprietor of the business may like to know, from time to time, what amount is due on credit purchase and to whom. If proper record is not maintained, it is not possible to get details of the transactions in regard to the income and expenses. At the end of the accounting period, the proprietor wants to know how much profit has been earned or loss has been incurred during the course of the period. For this lot of information is needed which can be gathered from a proper record of the transactions. Therefore, in book-keeping, the proper maintenance of books of account is indispensable for any business.\\nAt this level, the major concern of the curriculum is with book-keeping and preparation of financial statements. It seems important to mention at this point that book-keeping and preparation of financial statements have legal implications also. Maintenance of books of accounts and the preparation of financial statements of a company are guided by the Companies Act, banks and insurance companies by special Acts governing these institutions and so on. However, for sole-proprietorship and partnership business, there is no specific legislation regarding maintenance of books of accounts and preparation of financial statements.\", 'Objectives of Book-keeping\\nComplete Recording of Transactions - It is concerned with complete and permanent record of all transactions in a systematic and logical manner to show its financial effect on the business.\\nAscertainment of financial Effect on the Business - It is concerned with the combined effect of all the transactions made during the accounting period upon the financial position of the business as a whole.', 'DISTINCTION BETWEEN BOOK-KEEPING AND ACCOUNTING\\nSome people mistake book-keeping and accounting to be synonymous terms, but in fact they are different from each other. Accounting is a broad subject. It calls for a greater understanding of records obtained from book-keeping and an ability to analyse and interpret the information provided by book-keeping records. Book-keeping is the recording phase while accounting is\\nconcerned with the summarising phase of an accounting system. Book-keeping provides necessary data for accounting and accounting starts where book-keeping ends.\\nTop of Form\\nBook-keeping: This is a process primarily concerned with the systematic recording of financial transactions.\\nAccounting: This process entails summarizing and interpreting the transactions that have been recorded during book-keeping.\\nBook-keeping: It lays the foundation for the accounting process.\\nAccounting: It acts as a comprehensive language that communicates the financial health and performance of a business.\\nBook-keeping: The creation of financial statements is not a function of book-keeping.\\nAccounting: Financial statements are generated within this process, utilizing the initial records from book-keeping.\\nBook-keeping: It does not provide the necessary information for managerial decision-making.\\nAccounting: It enables management to make informed decisions based on the analysis of book-keeping records.\\nBook-keeping: This field does not extend into specialized sub-categories.\\nAccounting: It encompasses various sub-disciplines, such as financial accounting and management accounting.\\nBook-keeping: The financial position of a business cannot be deduced solely from book-keeping records.\\nAccounting: It allows for the determination of the financial position through detailed accounting reports derived from book-keeping data.\\nThis comparative outline clarifies the distinct roles and contributions of book-keeping and accounting within the financial recording and reporting processes of a business.', \"Relationship of Accounting and Book-keeping can be depicted in the following chart as\\nThe Hierarchy of Financial Recording and Reporting\\nThe field of financial management is structured into distinct yet interrelated layers, each building upon the foundational practices of the previous one. This hierarchy can be visualized as:\\nAccountancy: This is the broadest category within this financial hierarchy. It encompasses all the activities related to the management of financial information, including the processes of accounting and bookkeeping, along with the analytical tasks that inform strategic decision-making.\\nAccounting: Nested within accountancy, accounting refers to the systematic process of recording, summarizing, and reporting the financial transactions of a business. It provides a comprehensive view of the financial activities through the creation of various financial statements and reports.\\nBookkeeping: At the core of this hierarchy lies bookkeeping, which is a subset of accounting. It is the initial phase of the accounting process, focusing on the meticulous and detailed recording of each financial transaction in chronological order. Bookkeeping is essential for providing the raw financial data that will be further analyzed and interpreted in the accounting process.\\nIn essence, bookkeeping serves as the groundwork for accounting, which in turn is a critical component of the broader discipline of accountancy. Each level in this hierarchy is crucial for the accurate and effective management of a business's financial information.\", 'SUB-FIELDS OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe various sub-fields of accounting are:\\nFinancial Accounting - It covers the preparation and interpretation of financial statements and communication to the users of accounts. It is historical in nature as it records transactions which had already been occurred. The final step of financial accounting is the preparation of Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet. It primarily helps in determination of the net result for an accounting period and the financial position as on the given date.\\nManagement Accounting - It is concerned with internal reporting to the managers of a business unit. To discharge the functions of stewardship, planning, control and decision- making, the management needs variety of information. The different ways of grouping information and preparing reports as desired by managers for discharging their functions are referred to as management accounting. A very important component of the management accounting is cost accounting which deals with cost ascertainment and cost control. Management Accounting will be dealt with at higher levels of the Chartered Accountancy Course.\\nCost Accounting - The terminology of Cost Accounting published by the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of England defines cost accounting as:\\n\"the process of accounting for cost which begins with the recording of income and expenditure or the bases on which they are calculated and ends with the preparation of periodical statements and reports for ascertaining and controlling costs.\"\\nSocial Responsibility Accounting - The demand for social responsibility accounting stems from increasing social awareness about the undesirable by-products of economic activities. As already discussed earlier, social responsibility accounting is concerned with accounting for social costs incurred by the enterprise and social benefits created.\\nHuman Resource Accounting - Human resource accounting is an attempt to identify, quantify and report investments made in human resources of an organisation that are not presently accounted for under conventional accounting practice.', \"USERS OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\\nGenerally users of accounts are classified into two categories, (a) internal users and (b) external users. Management accounting is concerned with identifying information requirements as well as methods of providing such information to management while information requirements of the outside users are generally served by financial statements. Following are the various users of accounting information:\\nInvestors: They provide risk capital to the business. They need information to assess whether to buy, hold or sell their investment. Also they are interested to know the ability of the business to survive, prosper and to pay dividend. In non-corporate sector, where ownership and management are not essentially separated, the owners still need information about performance of the business and its financial position to decide whether to continue or shut down.\\nEmployees: Growth of the employees is directly related to the growth of the organisation and therefore, they are interested to know the stability, continuity and growth of the enterprise and its ability to provide remuneration, retirement and other benefits and to enhance employment opportunities.\\nLenders: They are interested to know whether their loan-principal and interest will be paid back when due.\\nSuppliers and Creditors: They are also interested to know the ability of the enterprise to pay their dues, that helps them to decide the credit policy for the relevant concern, rates to be charged and so on. Sometimes, they also become interested in long-term continuation of the enterprise if their existence becomes dependent on the survival of that business.\\nCustomers: Customers are also concerned with the stability and profitability of the enterprise because their functioning is more or less dependent on the supply of goods, suppose, a company produces some chemicals used by pharmaceutical companies and supplies chemicals on three month's credit. If all of a sudden it faces some trouble and is unable to supply the chemical, the customers will also be in trouble.\\nGovernment and their agencies: They regulate the functioning of business enterprises for public good, allocate scarce resources among competing enterprises, control prices, charge excise duties and taxes, and so they have continued interest in the business enterprise.\\nPublic: The public at large is interested in the functioning of the enterprise because it may make a substantial contribution to the local economy in many ways including the number of people employed and their patronage to local suppliers.\\nManagement: Management as whole is also interested in the accounts for various managerial decisions. On the basis of the accounts, management determines the effects of their various decisions on the functioning of the organisation. This helps them to make further managerial decisions.\", \"RELATIONSHIP OF ACCOUNTING WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES\\nAccounting is closely related with several other disciplines and thus to acquire a good knowledge in accounting one should be conversant with the relevant portions of such disciplines. In many cases they overlap accounting. The accountant should have a working knowledge of the related disciplines so that he can understand such overlapping areas and apply the knowledge of other disciplines in his own work wherever possible, or he can take the expert advice.\\nAccounting and Economics: Economics is viewed as a science of rational decisionmaking about the use of scarce resources. It is concerned with the analysis of efficient use of scarce resources for satisfying human wants. This may be viewed either from the perspective of a single firm or of the country as a whole.\\nAccounting and Statistics: The use of statistics in accounting can be appreciated better in the context of the nature of accounting records. Accounting information is very precise; it is exact to the last paisa. But, for decision-making purposes such precision is not necessary and hence, the statistical approximations are sought.\\nAccounting and Mathematics: Double Entry book-keeping can be converted in algebraic form; in fact the first known book on this subject was part of a treatise on algebra. The fundamental accounting equation will be discussed in detail under 'Dual Aspect Concept' of this chapter.\\nAccounting and Law: An economic entity operates within a legal environment. All transactions with suppliers and customers are governed by the Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act, the Negotiable Instruments Act, etc. The entity itself is created and controlled by laws. For example, a company is created by the Companies Act and also controlled by Companies Act.\\nAccounting and Management: Management is a broad occupational field, which comprises many functions and encompasses application of many disciplines including those mentioned above. Accountants are well placed in the management and play a key role in the management team. A large portion of accounting information is prepared for management decision-making. Although management relies on other data sources, accounting data are used as basic source documents. In the management team, an accountant is in a better position to understand and use such data. In other words, since an accountant plays an active role in management, he understands the data requirements. So the accounting system can be moulded to serve the management purpose.\", \"RELATIONSHIP OF ACCOUNTING WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES\\nAccounting is closely related with several other disciplines and thus to acquire a good knowledge in accounting one should be conversant with the relevant portions of such disciplines. In many cases they overlap accounting. The accountant should have a working knowledge of the related disciplines so that he can understand such overlapping areas and apply the knowledge of other disciplines in his own work wherever possible, or he can take the expert advice.\\nRelationship of Accounting and Economics: Economics is viewed as a science of rational decision making about the use of scarce resources. It is concerned with the analysis of efficient use of scarce resources for satisfying human wants. This may be viewed either from the perspective of a single firm or of the country as a whole.\\nAccounting is viewed as a system, which provides data to the users to permit informed judgement and decisions. Some non-accounting data are also relevant for decision making.\\nAccounting overlaps economics in many respects. It contributed a lot in improving the management decision-making process. But, economic theories influenced the development of the decision-making tools used in accounting.\\nHowever, there exists a wide gulf between economists' and accountants' concepts of income and capital. Accountants got the ideas of value, income and capital maintenance from economists, but brushed suitably to make them usable in practical circumstances. Accountants developed the valuation, measurement and decisionmaking techniques which may owe to the economic theorems for origin but these are moulded in the work environment and suitably tempered with reference to relevance, verifiability, freedom from bias, timeliness, comparability, reliability and understandability.\\nAn example may be given to explain the nexus between accounting and economics. Economists think that value of an asset is the present value of all future earnings which can be derived from such assets. Now think about a plant whose working life is more than one hundred years. How can you estimate future stream of earnings? So accountants developed the workable valuation base - the acquisition cost i.e., the price paid to acquire the assets.\\nAt the macro-level, accounting provides the database over which the economic decision models have been developed; micro-level data arranged by the accounting system is summed up to get macro-level database.\\nNon-overlapping zones of accounting are not negligible. Development of the systems of recording, classifying and summarising transactions and events, harmonising the systems by uniform rules and communicating the data is essentially a non-overlapping area of accounting.\", 'Relationship of Accounting and Statistics: The use of statistics in accounting can be appreciated better in the context of the nature of accounting records. Accounting information is very precise; it is exact to the last paisa. But, for decision-making purposes such precision is not necessary and hence, the statistical approximations are sought.\\nIn accounts, all values are important individually because they relate to business transactions. As against this, statistics is concerned with the typical value, behaviour or trend over a period of time or the degree of variation over a series of observations. Therefore, wherever a need arises for only broad generalisations or the average of relationships, statistical methods have to be applied in accounting data.\\nFurther, in accountancy, the classification of assets and liabilities as well as the heads of income and expenditure has been done as per the needs of financial recording to ascertain financial results of various operations. Other types of classification like the geographical and historical ones and ad hoc classification are done depending on the purpose to make such classification meaningful.\\nAccounting records generally take a short-term view of events and are confined to a year while statistical analysis is more useful if a longer view is taken for the purpose. For example, to fit the trend line a longer period will be required. However, statistical methods do use past accounting records maintained on a consistent basis.\\nThe functional relations showing mathematical relations of one variable with one or more other variables are based on statistical work. These relations are used widely in making cost or price estimates for some estimated future values assigned to the given independent variables. For example, given the functional relation of total cost to the price of an input, the effect of changes in future prices on the cost of production can be calculated.\\nIn accountancy, a number of financial and other ratios are based on statistical methods, which help in averaging them over a period of time. Several accounting and financial calculations are based on statistical formulae.\\nStatistical methods are helpful in developing accounting data and in their interpretation. For example, time series and cross-sectional comparison of accounting data is based on statistical techniques. Now- a-days multiple discriminate analysis is popularly used to identify symptoms of sickness of a business firm. Therefore, the study and application of statistical methods would add extra edge to the accounting data.', \"Relationship of Accounting and Mathematics: Double Entry book-keeping can be converted in algebraic form; in fact the first known book on this subject was part of a treatise on algebra. The fundamental accounting equation will be discussed in detail under 'Dual Aspect Concept' of this chapter.\\nKnowledge of arithmetic and algebra is a pre-requisite for accounting computations and measurements. Calculations of interest and annuity are the examples of such fundamental uses. While computing depreciation, finding out installments in hire purchase and instalments payment transactions, calculating amount to be set aside for repayment of loan and replacement of assets and calculating lease rentals, mathematical techniques are frequently used. Accounting data are also presented in ratio form.\\nWith the advent of the computer, mathematics is becoming a vital part of accounting. Instead of writing accounts in traditional fashion, the transactions and events can be recorded in the matrix form and the rules of matrix algebra can be applied for classifying and summarising data.\\nNow-a-days statistics and econometric models are largely used for developing decision models for the users of accounts. Also, Operations Research Techniques provide lot of decision models. Since accounting is meant for providing information to the users, to be effective, accounting data should feed the information requirements of such statistical, econometric and operations research models. Understanding mathematics has become a must to grasp the decision models framed by statisticians, econometricians and the O.R. experts.\\nPresently graphs and charts are being extensively used for communicating accounting information. In addition to statistical knowledge, knowledge in geometry and trigonometry seems to be essential to have a better understanding about the accounting communications system.\", 'Relationship of Accounting and Law: An economic entity operates within a legal environment. All transactions with suppliers and customers are governed by the Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act, the Negotiable Instruments Act, etc. The entity itself is created and controlled by laws. For example, a company is created by the Companies Act and also controlled by Companies Act.\\nSimilarly, every country has a set of economic, fiscal and labour laws. Transactions and events are always guided by laws of the land. Very often the accounting system to be followed has been prescribed by the law. For example, the Companies Act has prescribed the format of financial statements for companies.\\nBanking, insurance and electric supply undertakings may also have to produce financial statements as prescribed by the respective legislations controlling such entities.\\nHowever, legal prescription about the accounting system is the product of developments in accounting knowledge. That is to say, legislation about accounting system cannot be enacted unless there is a corresponding development in the accounting discipline. In that way accounting influences law and is also influenced by law.', 'Relationship of Accounting and Management: Management is a broad occupational field, which comprises many functions and encompasses application of many disciplines including those mentioned above.

In other words, since an accountant plays an active role in management, he understands the data requirements. So the accounting system can be moulded to serve the management purpose.', \"Relationship of Limitations of Accounting\\nThere are certain misconceptions regarding financial statements. A common man presumes that an income statement shows the correct income or loss of the enterprise and that a balance sheet depicts a perfectly true and fair picture of financial standing of that enterprise. It must be recognised that the accounting as a language has its own limitations. The figures of profit or loss generated by the accounting process are subject to various constraints within which the accounting works. The assumptions and conventions, on which the accounting is based, become the limitations of accounting. The financial statements are never free from subjectivity factor as these are largely the outcome of personal judgement of the accountant with regard to the adoption of the accounting policies. Following are certain instances:\\nThe factors which may be relevant in assessing the worth of the enterprise don't find place in the accounts as they cannot be measured in terms of money. The Balance sheet cannot reflect the value of certain factors like loyalty and skill of the personnel which may be the most valuable asset of an enterprise these days.\\nBalance Sheet shows the position of the business on the day of its preparation and not on the future date while the users of the accounts are interested in knowing the position of the business in the near future and also in long run and not for the past date.\\nAccounting ignores changes in some money factors like inflation etc.\\nThere are occasion when accounting principles conflict with each other.\\nCertain accounting estimates depend on the sheer personal judgement of the accountant, e.g., provision for doubtful debts, method of depreciation adopted, recording certain expenditure as revenue expenditure or capital expenditure, selection of method of valuation of inventories and the list is quite long.\\nFinancial statements consider those assets which can be expressed in monetary terms. Human resources although the very important asset of the enterprise are not shown in the balance sheet. There is no generally accepted formula for the valuation of human resources in money terms.\\nDifferent accounting policies for the treatment of same item adds to the probability of manipulations. Though through various laws and Accounting Standards, efforts are made to reduce these options to minimum but certainly could not be reduced to one.\\nIn nutshell, it can be said that the language of accounting has certain practical limitations and, therefore, the financial statements should be interpreted carefully keeping in mind all various factors influencing the true picture.\", 'ROLE OF ACCOUNTANT IN THE SOCIETY\\nThere are only a few types of profession in the world which are held in high esteem in public eyes and there is no denying the fact that the accounting profession is one of them. Goethe had called the accountant’s profession as ‘the fairest invention of the human mind’. At the core of all types of learned profession, there is the desire of public good and of finding the best way to serve society. By the use of the science of accountancy and under the spell of its art, a dynamic pattern which assists business in planning its future is woven by accountants out of the inert mass of non-speaking silent figures. This is what makes their profession an instrument of socio-economic change and welfare of the society.\\nAn accountant with his education, training, analytical mind and experience is best qualified to provide multiple need-based services to the ever growing society. The accountants of today can do full justice not only to matters relating to taxation, costing, management accounting, financial lay-out, company legislation and procedures but they can delve deep into the fields relating to financial policies, budgetary policies and even economic principles. The area of activities which can be undertaken by the accountants is not limited but it can also cover many additional facets.', \"Areas of Service\\nThe practice of accountancy has crossed its usual domain of preparation of financial statements, interpretation of such statements and audit thereof. Accountants are presently taking active role in company laws and other corporate legislation matters, in taxation laws matters (both direct and indirect) and in general management problems. Some of the services rendered by accountants to the society are briefly mentioned hereunder:\\nMaintenance of Books of Accounts: An accountant is able to maintain a systematic record of financial transactions in order to establish the net result of the transactions entered into during a period and to state the financial position of the concern as at a particular date.\\nFor the fulfillment of the twin objective of ascertaining the profit earned or loss suffered and the financial position, it is necessary that all transactions be recorded in a systematic manner, which can be done only by an accountant. Proper maintenance of books of accounts assists management in planning, decision-making, controlling functions.\\nStatutory Audit: Every limited company is required to appoint a chartered accountant or a firm of chartered accountants as their auditor who are statutorily required to report each year whether in their opinion the balance sheet shows a true and fair view of the state of affairs on the balance sheet date, and the profit and loss account shows a true and fair view of the profit or loss for the year.\\nAuditing is not confined to the accounts of companies; other organisations may also have their accounts audited, either because the law so requires (for example, the Co-operative Societies Act, the Income-tax Act, etc.) or because the proprietors wisely decided so (for example, a partnership firm or an individual trader).\\nInternal Audit: It is a management tool whereby an internal auditor thoroughly examines the accounting transactions and also the system, according to which these have been recorded with a view to ensure the management that the accounts are being properly maintained and the system contains adequate safeguards to check any leakage of revenue or misappropriation of property or assets and the operations have been carried out in conformity with the plans of management.\\nNow-a-days internal auditing has developed as a service to management. The internal auditor constructively contributes in improving the operational efficiency of the business through an independent review and appraisal of all business operations.\\nTaxation: An accountant can handle taxation matters of a business or a person and he can represent that business or person before the tax authorities and settle the tax liability\\nunder the statute prevailing. He can also assist in avoiding or reducing tax burden by proper planning of tax affairs.\\nAccountants also have a social obligation to express their views on broad tax policy, on the effect of tax rate on business and the economy in general and on all other aspects of taxation in which they have knowledge superior to that of the general public.\\nManagement Accounting and Consultancy Services: Management accountant performs an advisory function. He is largely responsible for internal reporting to the management for planning and controlling current operations, decision-making on special matters and for formulating long-range plans. His job is to collect, analyse, interpret and present all accounting information which is useful to the management. Accountant provides management consultancy services in the areas of management information system, expenditure control and evaluation of appraisal techniques for new investments and divestments, working capital management, corporate planning etc.\\nFinancial Advice: Many people need help and guidance in planning their personal financial affairs. An accountant who knows about finances, taxation and family problems is well placed to give such advice. Some of the areas in which an accountant can render financial advice are:\\nInvestments: An accountant can explain the significance of the formidable documents which shareholders receive from companies and help in making decisions relating to their investments.\\nInsurance: An accountant can provide information to his clients on various insurance policies and helps in choosing appropriate policy.\\nBusiness Expansion: As businesses grow in size and complexity and mergers are being considered, accountants are in the forefront in interpreting accounts, making suggestions as to the form of schemes and the fairness of proposals considering cost and financial consequences and generally advising their clients. They also advise on how to set about the problem of borrowing money or whether this is an appropriate method of finance. Accountants can render extremely useful service in connection of negotiations with foreign collaborators.\\nInvestigations: Financial investigations are required for a variety of purposes. Examples are:\\nTo ascertain the financial position of a business, for the information of interested parties in connection with an issue of capital, the purchase or sale of the business or a reconstruction or amalgamation.\\nTo help the management to decide whether it is cheaper to manufacture an article or to buy out.\\nTo ascertain why profits have fallen.\\nTo achieve greater efficiency in management.\\nTo ascertain whether fraud has occurred and if so, its nature and extent and to make suggestions which will help to prevent a recurrence.\\nTo value businesses and shares in private companies for purposes such as purchase, sale, estate duty or wealth tax etc.\\nFor such problems requiring financial investigation, you need an accountant. His task as an independent professional is to establish the facts fairly and clearly for the benefit of those who have to make decisions and to give advice in many areas in which he has competence and experience.\\nPension schemes: Specialist advice from actuaries, insurance agents or insurance company is needed before launching or amending a provident fund or pension scheme in a business. But before making a final decision, an accountant has to be consulted. Later on, his help may be needed for managing the scheme or obtaining tax relief.\\nOther Services\\nSecretarial Work: Companies, clubs, and associations indeed, virtually all organisations involve secretarial work. Accountants frequently do this work.\\nShare Registration Work: Accountants are often used by many companies to undertake the work involved in registering share transfers and new issues.\\nCompany Formation: In conjunction with legal advisers, accountants help in the formation of a company or advise against doing so.\\nReceiverships, Liquidations, etc.: An accountant has to sometimes take on the onerous duties of liquidator when a company is being wound up or receiver when a debenture holder exercises a right to recover a loan on which the borrower has defaulted. Accountant is just the man for the job. He is also just the man to help you to keep insolvency away if you consult him in time.\\nArbitrations: At times, accountants are invited by parties to act as arbitrators in a dispute or settle disputes of various kinds.\\nAs regards the Cost Accounts: A cost accountant's job is to continuously report cost data and related information at frequent intervals to the management.\\n(g) Accountant and Information Services: An accountant will be effective in his role if he supplies the information promptly and in an unambiguous language. He should develop a system by which there is a regular flow of information both horizontally and vertically.\\nThe information system should be such that comparability of financial statement is possible both business-wise and year-wise so that it benefits both the management and the investors. Dependence on data from the computerised information system will put new responsibilities on an accountant but his product will command greater attention and respect.\", \"Chartered Accountant in Industry\\nAn accountant, though he is a part of the highest planning team is not a planner in an industry. He works with the functional departments and translates the organisation's aims in terms of financial expectations. Therefore, he has to make a thorough study of the business and of individuals in the functional departments, whether they are engineers or salesmen. A qualified accountant will be able to play an important role in performing important functions of a business relating to accounting, costing and budgetary control, estimating and treasury.\", 'Chartered Accountant in Public Sector Enterprises\\nBoth in the developed and developing countries, public sector enterprises have become a special feature of the national economy. The system of financial and budgetary control and of accounting, auditing and reporting has, therefore, become a matter of interest and concern to the nation, and does not remain confined merely to a limited number of shareholders. The form of accounting followed by these corporations or companies is different from that of ordinary government accounting. It is the duty of the accountants to prepare the accounts and reports of these public corporations in such a way that they enable the general public to know how far the items appearing in the various types of records and financial statements justify their existence.', 'Chartered Accountant in Framing Fiscal Policies\\nAccountants have a positive role to play in the determination of proper fiscal policies and advancement of trade, commerce and industry. They should develop new techniques and prepare themselves for new fields of service towards their commitment to the concept of the public goods and services. A business enterprise can be successful in the commercial sense only if accounting and business knowledge are pooled together. It is a social obligation for both accountants in industry and in practice to disclose greater information regarding the corporate results. The state of affairs of the economy can be ascertained only when such consolidated corporate information is disclosed.', 'Chartered Accountant and Economic Growth\\nIn the present times accountants should conceive their duties as broadly as the conditions might require and do not restrict them to only literal compliance of the law. Their aim should be not to allow any individual to gain at the cost of the nation. Accountants have to accept a positive role and do their best to encourage efficiency in individual business units and encourage those social objectives which form the main foundation of a welfare state.']\n",

These include:\\nEntity Concept: This principle dictates that the business is treated as a separate entity from its owners or other businesses, with its own set of financial records.\\nMoney Measurement Concept: According to this convention, only transactions that can be measured in monetary terms are recorded in the accounting books.\\nPeriodicity Concept: This concept facilitates the division of the continuous life of an enterprise into periodic intervals, usually a year, to produce financial reports.\\nAccrual Concept: This principle states that income and expenses are recognized when they are earned or incurred, not necessarily when the cash is received or paid.\\nMatching Concept: This concept advises that expenses should be matched with revenues in the period in which the revenue was earned, leading to an accurate calculation of profit or loss.\\nGoing Concern Concept: When preparing financial statements, it is assumed that the business will continue to operate and will not be forced to halt operations or liquidate assets.\\nCost Concept: This convention maintains that all assets are recorded in the books of accounts at their purchase price, which includes cost of acquisition, transportation, and installation and not their market price.\\nRealisation Concept: Revenue is recognized at the point when it is earned and is measurable, regardless of when cash is received.\\nDual Aspect Concept: This fundamental principle of accounting states that every transaction has a dual effect on the financial position of the business, represented by the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity.\\nConservatism: This convention suggests a degree of caution in the face of uncertainty, typically by recognizing expenses and liabilities as soon as possible when there is uncertainty about the outcome, but only recognizing revenues and assets when they are assured of being received.\\nConsistency: This principle states that once an accounting method has been chosen, it should be used consistently from one period to another to ensure comparability of financial statements over time.\\nMateriality: This concept implies that all significant items, the knowledge of which might influence the decision of a user of the financial statements, should be properly reported.\\nThese concepts and conventions form the bedrock of financial accounting, ensuring that the financial statements present a true and fair view of the financial performance and position of the business.', \"INTRODUCTION\\nLet us imagine a situation where you are a proprietor and you take copies of your books of account to five different accountants. You ask them to prepare the financial statements on the basis of the above records and to calculate the profits of the business for the year. After few days, they are ready with the financial statements and all the five accountants have calculated five different amounts of profits and that too with very wide variations among them. Guess in such a situation what impact would it leave on you about accounting profession. To avoid this, a generally accepted set of rules have been developed. This generally accepted set of rules provides unity of understanding and unity of approach in the practice of accounting and also in better preparation and presentation of the financial statements.\\nAccounting is a language of the business. Financial statements prepared by the accountant communicate financial information to the various stakeholders for decision-making purpose. Therefore, it is important that financial statements prepared by different organizations should\\nbe prepared on uniform basis. Also, there should be consistency over a period of time in the preparation of these financial statements. If every accountant starts following his own norms and notions for accounting of different items, then there will be an utter confusion.\\nTo avoid confusion and to achieve uniformity, accounting process is applied within the conceptual framework of 'Generally Accepted Accounting Principles'(GAAPs). The term GAAPs is used to describe rules developed for the preparation of the financial statements and are called concepts, conventions, postulates, principles etc. These GAAPs are the backbone of the accounting information system, without which the whole system cannot even stand erectly. These principles are the ground rules, which define the parameters and constraints within which accounting reports are generated. Accounting principles are basic norms and assumptions on which the whole accounting system has been developed and established. Accountant also adheres to various accounting standards issued by the regulatory authority for the standardization of accounting policies to be followed under specific circumstances. These conceptual frameworks, GAAPs and accounting standards are considered as the theory base of accounting. Globally, for achieving the standardization, countries use the framework under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, countries may apply their respective GAAPs and related conceptual frameworks. For example, in India, companies are required to use AS or Ind-AS frameworks as applicable.\", 'ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS\\nAccounting concepts define the assumptions on the basis of which financial statements of a business entity are prepared. Certain concepts are perceived, assumed and accepted in accounting to provide a unifying structure and internal logic to accounting process. The word concept means idea or notion, which has universal application. Financial transactions are interpreted in the light of the concepts, which govern accounting methods. Concepts are those basic assumptions and conditions, which form the basis upon which the accountancy has been laid. Unlike physical science, accounting concepts are only result of broad consensus. These accounting concepts lay the foundation on the basis of which the accounting principles are formulated.', 'ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\\t\\n\"Accounting principles are a body of doctrines commonly associated with the theory and procedures of accounting serving as an explanation of current practices and as a guide for selection of conventions or procedures where alternatives exist.\"\\nAccounting principles must satisfy the following conditions:\\nThey should be based on real assumptions;\\nThey must be simple, understandable and explanatory;\\nThey must be followed consistently;\\nThey should be able to reflect future predictions;\\nThey should be informational for the users.', \"ACCOUNTING CONVENTIONS\\nAccounting conventions emerge out of accounting practices, commonly known as accounting principles, adopted by various organizations over a period of time. These conventions are derived by usage and practice. The accountancy bodies of the world may change any of the convention to improve the quality of accounting information. Accounting conventions need not have universal application.\\nIn the study material, the terms 'accounting concepts', 'accounting principles' and 'accounting conventions' have been used interchangeably to mean those basic points of agreement on which financial accounting theory and practice are founded.\", \"CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES AND CONVENTIONS - AN OVERVIEW\\nNow we shall study in detail the various accounting concepts on which accounting is based. The following are the widely accepted accounting concepts:\\nConcepts, Principles Entity concept: \\nEntity concept states that business enterprise is a separate identity apart from its owner. Accountants should treat a business as distinct from its owner. Business transactions are recorded in the business books of accounts and owner's transactions in his personal books of accounts. The practice of distinguishing the affairs of the business from the personal affairs of the owners originated only in the early days of the doubleentry book-keeping. This concept helps in keeping business affairs free from the influence of the personal affairs of the owner. This basic concept is applied to all the organizations whether sole proprietorship or partnership or corporate entities.\\nEntity concept keeps the business separate from its owner. In a way, the entity concept helps to ascertain how much amount of money is due to the owner in form of his capital and share of profits earned. It also helps to perform accounting from the point of view of the business and not that of the owner. For example, if a person runs a business and pays money from his own pocket for his son's school fee, it will not constitute a transaction in the books of the business. However, if the person withdraws\\nmoney from the business to pay for his son's school fee it will constitute a transaction to be recorded in the books of the business as amount withdrawn by the owner.\\nEntity concept means that the enterprise is liable to the owner for capital investment made by the owner. Since the owner invested capital, which is also called risk capital, he has claim on the profit of the enterprise. A portion of profit which is apportioned to the owner and is immediately payable becomes current liability in the case of corporate entities.\", 'Concepts, Principles Money measurement concept: \\nAs per this concept, only those transactions, which can be measuredin terms of money are recorded. Since money is the medium of exchange and the standard of economic value, this concept requires that those transactions alone that are capable of being measured in terms of money be only to be recorded in the books of accounts. Transactions, even if, they affect the results of the business materially, are not recorded if they are not convertible in monetary terms.\\nFor example, a business owning a factory on a piece of 1 acre of land, with an office building with 2 floors, having 20 computers, and 10 units of machine cannot show these items under different measurement units. These items need to be expressed in monetary terms. The factory price might be , cost of land might be , building\\nwith a cost of , computers at a cost of 10 lac and machines with a cost of  need to be recorded.\\nHowever, the concept has its own limitations. Transactions and events that cannot be expressed in terms of money are not recorded in the business books. For example; employees of the organization are, no doubt, the assets of the organizations but their measurement in monetary terms is not possible therefore, not included in the books of account of the organization. Measuring unit for money is taken as the currency of the ruling country i.e., the ruling currency of a country provides a common denomination for the value of material objects.\\nIt may be mentioned that when transactions occur across the boundary of a country, one may see many currencies. Suppose a businessman sells goods worth ₹ 50 lakhs at home and he also sells goods worth of 1 lakh Euro in the United States. What is his total sales? ₹ 50 lakhs plus 1 lakh Euro.\\nThese are not amenable to even arithmetic treatment. So, transactions are to be recorded at uniform monetary unit i.e. in one currency. Suppose EURO 1 = ₹ 71 .\\nTotal Sales  lakhs plus 71 lakhs  lakhs. Money Measurement Concept imparts the essential flexibility for measurement and interpretation of accounting data.\\nThis concept ignores that money is an inelastic yardstick for measurement as it is based on the implicit assumption that purchasing power of the money is not of sufficient importance as to require adjustment. For example, a unit of land purchased 10 years ago for  and a similar unit of land purchased now for  will still be shown at the respective values, i.e., total of . Though in real world, the true value of the units together might be . Accordingly, accounting does not give a true and fair view of the affairs of the business.\\nAs mentioned earlier, many material transactions and events are not recorded in the books of accounts just because they cannot be measured in monetary terms. Yet it is used for accounting purposes because it is not possible to adopt a better measurement scale.\\nEntity and money measurement are viewed as the basic concepts on which other procedural concepts hinge.', \"Concepts, Principles Periodicity concept: \\nThis is also called the concept of definite accounting period. As per going concern' concept an indefinite life of the entity is assumed. For a business entity it causes inconvenience to measure performance achieved by the entity in the ordinary course of business.\\nIf a textile mill lasts for 100 years, it is not desirable to measure its performance as well as financial position only at the end of its life.\\nSo, a small but workable fraction of time is chosen out of infinite life cycle of the business entity for measuring performance and looking at the financial position. Generally, one year period is taken up for performance measurement and appraisal of financial position. However, it may also be 6 months or 9 months or 15 months.\\nAccording to this concept accounts should be prepared after every period & not at the end of the life of the entity. Usually, this period is one calendar year. We generally follow from 1st April of a year to 31st March of the immediately following year.\\nThus, for performance appraisal it is not necessary to look into the revenue and expenses of an unduly long time-frame. This concept makes the accounting system workable and the term 'accrual' meaningful. If one thinks of indefinite time-frame, nothing will accrue. There cannot be unpaid expenses and non- receipt of revenue. Accrued expenses or accrued revenue is only with reference to a finite time-frame which is called accounting period.\\nThus, the periodicity concept facilitates in:\\nComparing of financial statements of different periods\\nUniform and consistent accounting treatment for ascertaining the profit and assets of the business\\nMatching periodic revenues with expenses for getting correct results of the business operations\\nConcepts, Principles Accrual concept: \\nUnder accrual concept, the effects of transactions and other events are recognised on mercantile basis i.e., when they occur (and not as cash or a cash equivalent is received or paid) and they are recorded in the accounting records and reported in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. Financial statements prepared on the accrual basis inform users not only of past events involving the payment and receipt of cash but also of obligations to pay cash in the future and of resources that represent cash to be received in the future.\\nTo understand accrual assumption knowledge of revenues and expenses is required. Revenue is the gross inflow of cash, receivables and other consideration arising in the course of the ordinary activities of an enterprise from sale of goods, from rendering services and from the use by others of enterprise's resources yielding interest, royalties and dividends. For example, (1) Mr. X started a cloth merchandising. He invested , bought merchandise worth ₹ 50,000 . He sold such merchandise for ₹ 60,000 . Customers paid him ₹ 50,000 cash and assure him to pay ₹ 10,000 shortly. His revenue\\nis ₹ 60,000 . It arose in the ordinary course of cloth business; Mr. X received ₹ 50,000 in cash and  by way of receivables.\\nTake another example; (2) an electricity supply undertaking supplies electricity spending ₹  for fuel and wages and collects electricity bill in one month  by way of electricity charges. This is also revenue which arose from rendering services.\\nLastly, (3) Mr. A invested ₹  in a business. He purchased a machine paying ₹ . He rented it for ₹ 20,000 annually to Mr. B. ₹ 20,000 is the revenue of Mr. A; it arose from the use PG the enterprise's resources.\\nExpense is a cost relating to the operations of an accounting period or to the revenue earned during the period or the benefits of which do not extend beyond that period.\\nIn the first example, Mr. X spent ₹ 50,000 to buy the merchandise; it is the expense of generating revenue of . In the second instance  are the expenses. Also whenever any asset is used it has a finite life to generate benefit. Suppose, the machine purchased by Mr. A in the third example will last for 10 years only. Then  is the expense every year relating to the cost of machinery.\\nAccrual means recognition of revenue and costs as they are earned or incurred and not as money is received or paid. The accrual concept relates to measurement of income, identifying assets and liabilities.\\nExample: Mr. J D buys clothing of ₹ 50,000 paying cash  and sells at  of which customers paid only ₹ 50,000.\\nHis revenue is ₹ 60,000 , not  cash received. Expense (i.e., cost incurred for the revenue) is ₹ 50,000 , not ₹ 20,000 cash paid. So the accrual concept based profit is ₹ 10,000 (Revenue - Expenses).\\nAs per Accrual Concept: Revenue - Expenses  Profit\\nAccrual Concept provides the foundation on which the structure of present-day accounting has been developed.\\nAlternative as per Cash basis\\nCash received in ordinary course of business - Cash paid in ordinary course of business  profit.\\nTiming of revenue and expense booking could be different from cash receipt or paid.\\nwhen cash received before revenue - a liability is created when cash is is booked received in advance\\nwhen cash received after revenue is booked\\nwhen cash paid before expense is booked\\nwhen cash paid after expense is booked an asset called Trade receivables is created\\ncreates an asset called Trade Advance when cash is paid in advance\\ncreates a liability called payables or Trade payables or outstanding liabilities\\nConcepts, Principles Matching concept: \\nIn this concept, all expenses matched with the revenue of that period should only be taken into consideration. In the financial statements of the organization if any revenue is recognized then expenses related to earn that revenue should also be recognized.\\nThis concept is based on accrual concept as it considers the occurrence of expenses and income and do not concentrate on actual inflow or outflow of cash. This leads to adjustment of certain items like prepaid and outstanding expenses, unearned or accrued incomes.\\nIt is not necessary that every expense identify every income. Some expenses are directly related to the revenue and some are time bound. For example:- selling expenses are directly related to sales but rent, salaries etc are recorded on accrual basis for a particular accounting period. In other words periodicity concept has also been followed while applying matching concept.\\nMr. P K started cloth business. He purchased 10,000 pcs. garments @ ₹ 100 per piece and sold 8,000 pcs. @ ₹ 150 per piece during the accounting period of 12 months 1st January to  December, 2022. He paid shop rent @ ₹ 3,000 per month for 11 months and paid  to the suppliers of garments and received ₹  from the customers.\\nLet us see how the accrual and periodicity concepts operate.\\nPeriodicity Concept fixes up the time-frame for which the performance is to be measured and financial position is to be appraised. Here, it is January 2022 - December, 2022. Therefore, revenues and expenses are to be measured for the year 2022 and assets and liabilities are to be ascertained as on  December, 2022.\\nAccrual Concept operates to measure revenue of ₹ 12,00,000 (arising out of sale of garments 8,000 Pcs  ₹ 150) which accrued during 2022, not the cash received  and also the expenses correctly. Shop rent for 12 months is an expense item amounting to ₹ 36,000 , not ₹ 33,000 the cash paid.\\nShould the accountant treat  as expenses for purchase of merchandise? And should he treat ₹ 1,64,000 as profit? (Revenue ₹ 12,00,000-Merchandise ₹ 10,00,000. Shop Rent ₹ 36,000). Obviously, the answer is No. Matching links revenue with expenses.\\nRevenue - Expenses  Profit\\nBut this unqualified equation may create misconception.\\nIt should be defined as: Periodic Profit  Periodic Revenue - Matched Expenses\\nFrom the revenue of an accounting period such expenses are deducted which are expended to generate the revenue to determine profit of that period.\\nIn the given example revenue relates to only sale of 8,000 pcs. of garments. Therefore, the cost of 8,000 pcs of garments should be treated as expenses.\\nThus, Profit = Revenue\\nRevenue: ₹12,00,000\\nLess Expenses:\\nMerchandise: ₹8,00,000\\nShop Rent: ₹36,000\\nTotal Expenses: (₹8,36,000)\\nProfit:\\nNet Profit: ₹3,64,000\\nAssets:\\nInventory: (2,000 pcs x ₹100) = ₹2,00,000\\nTrade Receivables: ₹2,00,000\\nCash: (Cash Receipts ₹10,00,000 - Cash Payments ₹8,33,000) = ₹1,67,000\\nTotal Assets: ₹5,67,000\\nLiabilities:\\nTrade Payables: ₹2,00,000\\nExpenses Payables: ₹3,000\\nCapital (Profit): ₹3,64,000\\nTotal Liabilities: ₹5,67,000\\nThus, accrual, matching and periodicity concepts work together for income measurement and recognition of assets and liabilities.\", 'Concepts, Principles Going Concern concept: \\nThe financial statements are normally prepared on the assumption that an enterprise is a going concern and will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Hence, it is assumed that the enterprise has neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or curtail materially the scale of its operations; if such an\\nintention or need exists, the financial statements may have to be prepared on a different basis and, if so, the basis used needs to be disclosed.\\nThe valuation of assets of a business entity is dependent on this assumption. Traditionally, accountants follow historical cost in majority of the cases.\\nSuppose Mr. X purchased a machine for his business paying  out of  invested by him. He also paid transportation expenses and installation charges amounting to . If he is still willing to continue the business, his financial position will be as follows:\\nBALANCE SHEET\\nThis balance sheet shows that the entity has a total of ₹7,00,000 in capital, which matches the total value of assets. The assets are composed of machinery worth ₹5,70,000 and cash amounting to ₹1,30,000. The total liabilities equal the total assets, ensuring that the balance sheet is balanced.\\nNow if he decides to back out and desires to sell the machine, it may fetch more than or less than . So his financial position should be different. If going concern concept is taken, increase/ decrease in the value of assets in the short-run is ignored. The concept indicates that assets are kept for generating benefit in future, not for immediate sale; current change in the asset value is not realisable and so it should not be counted.\\nThis can be understood differently with some examples we may have come across in real life. Recently during pandemic, many businesses were shutting down due to heavy losses. If the financial statement of these entities does not reveal the fact of winding up due to losses, it will mislead the stakeholders. And, a sudden news of the business shutting down would be a setback to those stakeholders.\\nTherefore, entities need to assess at the time of preparation of financial statements, whether they are likely to continue to operate their business. If the Going Concern assumption is under question, the same information should be communicated to the stakeholders.', 'Concepts, Principles Cost concept: \\nBy this concept, the value of an asset is to be determined on the basis of historical cost, in other words, acquisition cost. Although there are various measurement bases, accountants traditionally prefer this concept in the interests of objectivity. When a machine is acquired by paying ₹ , following cost concept the value of the machine is taken as ₹ 5,00,000. It is highly objective and free from all bias. Other measurement bases are not so objective. Current cost of an asset is not easily determinable. If the asset is purchased on 1.1.1995 and such model is not available in\\nthe market, it becomes difficult to determine which model is the appropriate equivalent to the existing one. Similarly, unless the machine is actually sold, realisable value will give only a hypothetical figure. Lastly, present value base is highly subjective because to know the value of the asset one has to chase the uncertain future.\\nHowever, the cost concept creates a lot of distortion too as outlined below:\\nIn an inflationary situation when prices of all commodities go up on an average, acquisition cost loses its relevance. For example, a piece of land purchased on 1.1.1995 for ₹ 2,000 may cost ₹  as on 1.1.2022. So if the accountant makes valuation of asset at historical cost, the accounts will not reflect the true position.\\nHistorical cost-based accounts may lose comparability. Mr. X invested ₹ 1,00,000 in a machine on 1.1.1995 which produces ₹ 50,000 cash inflow during the year 2022, while Mr. Y invested ₹ 5,00,000 in a machine on 1.1.2005 which produced  cash inflows during the year. Mr. X earned at the rate  while Mr. Y earned at the rate . Who is more efficient? Since the assets are recorded at the historical cost, the results are not comparable. Obviously, it is a corollary to (a).\\nMany assets do not have acquisition costs. Human assets of an enterprise are an example. The cost concept fails to recognise such asset although it is a very important asset of any organization.\\nMany other controversial issues have arisen in financial accounting that revolves around the cost concept which will be discussed at the advanced stage. However, later on we shall see that in many circumstances, the cost convention is not followed. See conservatism concept for an example, which will be discussed later on in this unit.', 'Concepts, Principles Realization concept: \\nIt closely follows the cost concept. Any change in value of an asset is to be recorded only when the business realises it. When an asset is recorded at its historical cost of  and even if its current cost is  such change is not counted unless there is certainty that such change will materialize.\\nHowever, accountants follow a more conservative path. They try to cover all probable losses but do not count any probable gain. That is to say, if accountants anticipate decrease in value they count it, but if there is increase in value they ignore it until it is realized. Economists are highly critical about the realisation concept. According to them, this concept creates value distortion and makes accounting meaningless.\\nThus, the going concern, cost concept and realization concept gives the valuation criteria.\\nDual aspect concept: This concept is the core of double entry book-keeping. Every transaction or event has two aspects:\\nIt increases one Asset and decreases other Asset;\\nIt increases an Asset and simultaneously increases Liability;\\nIt decreases one Asset, increases another Asset;\\nIt decreases one Asset, decreases a Liability.\\nAlternatively:\\nIt increases one Liability, decreases other Liability;\\nIt increases a Liability, increases an Asset;\\nIt decreases Liability, increases other Liability;\\nIt decreases Liability, decreases an Asset.', \"Concepts, Principles Conservatism: \\nConservatism states that the accountant should not anticipate any future income however they should provide for all possible losses. When there are many alternative values of an asset, an accountant should choose the method which leads to the lesser value. Later on, we shall see that the golden rule of current assets valuation - 'cost or market price whichever is lower' originated from this concept.\\nThe Realisation Concept also states that no change should be counted unless it has materialised. The Conservatism Concept puts a further brake on it. It is not prudent to count unrealised gain but it is desirable to guard against all possible losses.\\nFor this concept there should be at least three qualitative characteristics of financial statements, namely,\\nPrudence, i.e., judgement about the possible future losses which are to be guarded, as well as gains which are uncertain.\\nNeutrality, i.e., unbiased outlook is required to identify and record such possible losses, as well as to exclude uncertain gains,\\nFaithful representation of alternative values.\\nThis concept is of wider importance to investors since they would need to take a decision about their money being invested in the business. Recording future profits when these have not been earned would suggest that the business is booming, and the investors would be tempted to put more money into the same. However, eventually if the profit is not earned, the investors are likely to loose their investments. At the same time, if the entity expects to make a loss in future, it is prudent to show that loss in the books in present itself. This acts as a safeguard for the investors as they would be prudent to make the investment decisions. For example: Mr.  runs a business of computers. He purchased 10 computers at a cost of  each and is expecting to be able to sell these computers at the current market price of ₹ 25,000 each. Note that the conservatism principle does not allow to recognise the profit on the computers unless the sale has been made. Since, this is a future profit, Mr. X needs to follow a prudent approach while recording the transactions in his books and ignore the profit until it is earned\\nHowever, before sale, the market price of the computers declines to ₹ 17,000 each. Under the conservatism approach, Mr. X needs to recognise that loss of  per computer, even though the sale has not been made.\\nMany accounting authors, however, are of the view that conservatism essentially leads to understatement of income and wealth and it should not be the basis for the preparation of financial statements.\", \"Concepts, Principles Consistency: \\nIn order to achieve comparability of the financial statements of an enterprise through time, the accounting policies are followed consistently from one period to another; a change in an accounting policy is made only in certain exceptional circumstances.\\nThe concept of consistency is applied particularly when alternative methods of accounting are equally acceptable. For example, a company may adopt any of several methods of depreciation such as written-down-value method, straight-line method, etc. Likewise, there are many methods for valuation of inventories. But following the principle of consistency it is advisable that the company should follow consistently\\nover years the same method of depreciation or the same method of valuation of Inventories which is chosen. However, in some cases though there is no inconsistency, they may seem to be inconsistent apparently. In case of valuation of Inventories if the company applies the principle 'at cost or market price whichever is lower' and if this principle accordingly results in the valuation of Inventories in one year at cost price and the market price in the other year, there is no inconsistency here. It is only an application of the principle.\\nBut the concept of consistency does not imply non-flexibility as not to allow the introduction of improved method of accounting.\\nAn enterprise should change its accounting policy in any of the following circumstances only:\\nTo bring the books of accounts in accordance with the issued Accounting Standards.\\nTo comply with the provision of law.\\nWhen under changed circumstances, it is felt that new method will reflect a true and fair picture in the financial statement.\", \"Concepts, Principles Materiality: \\nMateriality principle permits other concepts to be ignored, if the effect is not considered material. This principle is an exception to full disclosure principle. According to materiality principle, all the items having significant economic effect on the business of the enterprise should be disclosed in the financial statements and any insignificant item which will only increase the work of the accountant but will not be relevant to the users' need should not be disclosed in the financial statements.\\nThe term materiality is the subjective term. It is on the judgement, common sense and discretion of the accountant that which item is material and which is not. For example, stationary purchased by the organization though not used fully in the accounting year purchased still shown as an expense of that year because of the materiality concept. Similarly, depreciation on small items like books, calculators etc. is taken as  in the year of purchase though used by the entity for more than a year. This is because the amount for books or calculator is very small to be shown in the balance sheet though it is the asset of the company.\\nThe materiality depends not only upon the amount of the item but also upon the size of the business, nature and level of information, level of the person making the decision etc. Moreover, an item material to one person may be immaterial to another person. What is important is that omission of any information should not impair the decision-making of various users.\", 'FUNDAMENTAL ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS\\nThere are three fundamental accounting assumptions:\\nGoing Concern\\nConsistency\\nAccrual\\nAll the above three fundamental accounting assumptions have already been explained in para 2.5.\\nIf nothing has been written about the fundamental accounting assumption in the financial statements then it is assumed that they have already been followed in their preparation of financial statements. However, if any of the above-mentioned fundamental accounting assumption is not followed then this fact should be specifically disclosed.', \"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nThe aim of accounting is to keep systematic records to ascertain financial performance and financial position of an entity and to communicate the relevant financial information to the interested user groups. The financial statements are basic means through which the management of an entity makes public communication of the financial information along with selected quantitative details. They are structured financial representations of the financial position and the performance of an enterprise. To have a record of all business transactions and also to determine whether all these transactions resulted in either 'profit or loss' for the period, all the entities will prepare financial statements viz., balance sheet, profit and loss account, cash flow statement etc. by following various accounting concepts, principles, and conventions which have been already discussed in detail.\", 'Qualitative Characteristics of financial Statements\\nQualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information provided in financial statements useful to users. The following are the important qualitative characteristics of the financial statements:\\nUnderstandability: An essential quality of the information provided in financial statements is that it must be readily understandable by users. For this purpose, it is assumed that users have a reasonable knowledge of business, economic activities and accounting and study the information with reasonable diligence. Information about complex matters that should be included in the financial statements because of its relevance to the economic decision-making needs of users should not be excluded merely on the ground that it may be too difficult for certain users to understand.\\nRelevance: To be useful, information must be relevant to the decision-making needs of users. Information has the quality of relevance when it influences the economic decisions of users by helping them evaluate past, present or future events or confirming, or correcting, their past evaluations.\\nReliability: To be useful, information must also be reliable, Information has the quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be depended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.\\nComparability: Users must be able to compare the financial statements of an enterprise through time in order to identify trends in its financial position, performance and cash flows. Users must also be able to compare the financial statements of different enterprises in order to evaluate their relative financial position, performance and cash flows. Hence, the measurement and display of the financial effects of like transactions and other events must be carried out in a consistent way throughout an enterprise and over time for that enterprise and in a consistent way for different enterprises.\\nMateriality: The relevance of information is affected by its materiality. Information is material if its misstatement (i.e., omission or erroneous statement) could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial information. Materiality depends on the size and nature of the item or error, judged in the particular circumstances of its misstatement. Materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point rather than being a primary qualitative characteristic which the information must have if it is to be useful.\\nFaithful Representation: To be reliable, information must represent faithfully the transactions and other events it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. Thus, for example, a balance sheet should represent faithfully the transactions and other events that result in assets, liabilities and equity of the enterprise at the reporting date which meet the recognition criteria.\\nSubstance over Form: If information is to represent faithfully the transactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality and not merely their legal form. The substance of transactions or other events is not always consistent with that which is apparent from their legal or contrived form. For example, where rights and beneficial interest in an immovable property are transferred but the documentations and legal formalities are pending, the recording of acquisition/disposal (by the transferee and transferor respectively) would in substance represent the transaction entered into.\\nNeutrality: To be reliable, the information contained in financial statements must be neutral, that is, free from bias. Financial statements are not neutral if, by the selection or presentation of information, they influence the making of a decision or judgement in order to achieve a predetermined result or outcome.\\nPrudence: The preparers of financial statements have to contend with the uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the collectability of receivables, the probable useful life of plant and machinery, and the warranty claims that may occur. Such uncertainties are recognised by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by the exercise of prudence in the preparation of the financial statements. Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of the judgments needed in making the estimates required under conditions of uncertainty, such that assets or income are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not understated. However, the exercise of prudence does not allow, for example, the creation of hidden reserves or excessive provisions, the deliberate understatement of assets or income, or the deliberate overstatement of liabilities or expenses, because the financial statements would then not be neutral and, therefore, not have the quality of reliability.\\nFull, fair and adequate disclosure: The financial statement must disclose all the reliable and relevant information about the business enterprise to the management and also to their external users for which they are meant, which in turn will help them to take a reasonable and rational decision. For it, it is necessary that financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles i.e the information is accounted for and presented in accordance with its substance and economic reality and not merely with its legal form. The disclosure should be full and final so that users can correctly assess the financial position of the enterprise.\\nCompleteness: To be reliable, the information in financial statements must be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost. An omission can cause information to be false or misleading and thus unreliable and deficient in terms of its relevance.', 'Qualitative Characteristics of financial Statements\\nQualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information provided in financial statements useful to users. The following are the important qualitative characteristics of the financial statements:\\nFinancial Statements of Understandability: An essential quality of the information provided in financial statements is that it must be readily understandable by users. For this purpose, it is assumed that users have a reasonable knowledge of business, economic activities and accounting and study the information with reasonable diligence. Information about complex matters that should be included in the financial statements because of its relevance to the economic decision-making needs of users should not be excluded merely on the ground that it may be too difficult for certain users to understand.', 'Financial Statements of Relevance: To be useful, information must be relevant to the decision-making needs of users. Information has the quality of relevance when it influences the economic decisions of users by helping them evaluate past, present or future events or confirming, or correcting, their past evaluations.\\nThe predictive and confirmatory roles of information are interrelated. For example, information about the current level and structure of asset holdings has value to users when they endeavour to predict the ability of the enterprise to take advantage of opportunities and its ability to react to adverse situations. The same information plays a confirmatory role in respect of past predictions about, for example, the way in which the enterprise would be structured or the outcome of planned operations.\\nInformation about financial position and past performance is frequently used as the basis for predicting future financial position and performance and other matters in which users are directly interested, such as dividend and wage payments, share price movements and the ability of the enterprise to meet its commitments as they fall due. To have predictive value, information need not be in the form of an explicit forecast. The ability to make predictions from financial statements is enhanced, however, by the manner in which information on past transactions and events is displayed. For example, the predictive value of the statement of profit and loss is enhanced if unusual, abnormal and infrequent items of income and expense are separately disclosed.', 'Financial Statements of Reliability: To be useful, information must also be reliable, Information has the quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be depended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.\\nInformation may be relevant but so unreliable in nature or representation that its recognition may be potentially misleading. For example, if the validity and amount of a claim for damages under a legal action against the enterprise are highly uncertain, it may be inappropriate for the enterprise to recognise the amount of the claim in the balance sheet, although it may be appropriate to disclose the amount and circumstances of the claim.', 'Financial Statements of Comparability: Users must be able to compare the financial statements of an enterprise through time in order to identify trends in its financial position, performance and cash flows. Users must also be able to compare the financial statements of different enterprises in order to evaluate their relative financial position, performance and cash flows. Hence, the measurement and display of the financial effects of like transactions and other events must be carried out in a consistent way throughout an enterprise and over time for that enterprise and in a consistent way for different enterprises.\\nAn important implication of the qualitative characteristic of comparability is that users be informed of the accounting policies employed in the preparation of the financial statements, any changes in those polices and the effects of such changes. Users need to be able to identify differences between the accounting policies for like transactions and other events used by the same enterprise from period to period and by different enterprises. Compliance with Accounting Standards, including the disclosure of the accounting policies used by the enterprise, helps to achieve comparability.\\nThe need for comparability should not be confused with mere uniformity and should not be allowed to become an impediment to the introduction of improved accounting standards. It is not appropriate for an enterprise to continue accounting in the same manner for a transaction or other event if the policy adopted is not in keeping with the qualitative characteristics of relevance and reliability. It is also inappropriate for an enterprise to leave its accounting policies unchanged when more relevant and reliable alternatives exist.\\nUsers wish to compare the financial position, performance and cash flows of an enterprise over time. Hence, it is important that the financial statements show corresponding information for the preceding period(s).\\nThe four principal qualitative characteristics are understandability, relevance,reliability and comparability.', 'Financial Statements of Materiality: The relevance of information is affected by its materiality. Information is material if its misstatement (i.e., omission or erroneous statement) could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial information. Materiality depends on the size and nature of the item or error, judged in the particular circumstances of its misstatement. Materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point rather than being a primary qualitative characteristic which the information must have if it is to be useful.', 'Financial Statement of Faithful Representation: To be reliable, information must represent faithfully the transactions and other events it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. Thus, for example, a balance sheet should represent faithfully the transactions and other events that result in assets, liabilities and equity of the enterprise at the reporting date which meet the recognition criteria.\\nMost financial information is subject to some risk of being less than a faithful representation of that which it purports to portray. This is not due to bias, but rather to inherent difficulties either in identifying the transactions and other events to be measured or in devising and applying measurement and presentation techniques that can convey messages that correspond with those transactions and events. In certain\\ncases, the measurement of the financial effects of items could be so uncertain that enterprises generally would not recognise them in the financial statements; for example, although most enterprises generate goodwill internally over time, it is usually difficult to identify or measure that goodwill reliably. In other cases, however, it may be relevant to recognise items and to disclose the risk of error surrounding their recognition and measurement.', 'Financial Statements of Substance over Form: If information is to represent faithfully the transactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality and not merely their legal form. The substance of transactions or other events is not always consistent with that which is apparent from their legal or contrived form. For example, where rights and beneficial interest in an immovable property are transferred but the documentations and legal formalities are pending, the recording of acquisition/disposal (by the transferee and transferor respectively) would in substance represent the transaction entered into.', 'Financial Statements of Neutrality: To be reliable, the information contained in financial statements must be neutral, that is, free from bias. Financial statements are not neutral if, by the selection or presentation of information, they influence the making of a decision or judgement in order to achieve a predetermined result or outcome.', 'Financial Statements of Prudence: The preparers of financial statements have to contend with the uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the collectability of receivables, the probable useful life of plant and machinery, and the warranty claims that may occur. Such uncertainties are recognised by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by the exercise of prudence in the preparation of the financial statements. Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of the judgments needed in making the estimates required under conditions of uncertainty, such that assets or income are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not understated. However, the exercise of prudence does not allow, for example, the creation of hidden reserves or excessive provisions, the deliberate understatement of assets or income, or the deliberate overstatement of liabilities or expenses, because the financial statements would then not be neutral and, therefore, not have the quality of reliability.', 'Financial Statements of Full, fair and adequate disclosure: The financial statement must disclose all the reliable and relevant information about the business enterprise to the management and also to their external users for which they are meant, which in turn will help them to take a reasonable and rational decision. For it, it is necessary that financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles i.e the information is accounted for and presented in accordance with its substance and economic reality and not merely with its legal form. The disclosure should be full and final so that users can correctly assess the financial position of the enterprise.\\nThe principle of full disclosure implies that nothing should be omitted while principle of fair disclosure implies that all the transactions recorded should be accounted in a manner that financial statement purports true and fair view of the results of the business of the enterprise and adequate disclosure implies that the information influencing the decision of the users should be disclosed in detail and should make sense.\\nThis principle is widely used in corporate organizations because of separation in management and ownership. The Companies Act in pursuant of this principle came out with the format of balance sheet and profit and loss account. The disclosures of all the major accounting policies and other information are to be provided in the form of footnotes, annexures etc. The practice of appending notes to the financial statements is the outcome of this principle.', 'Financial Statements of Completeness: To be reliable, the information in financial statements must be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost. An omission can cause information to be false or misleading and thus unreliable and deficient in terms of its relevance.\\nThus, if accounting information is to present faithfully the transactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality, not by their legal form. For example, if a business enterprise sells its assets to others but still uses the assets as usual for the purpose of the business by making some arrangement with the seller, it simply becomes a legal transaction. The economic reality is that the business is using the assets as usual for deriving the benefit. Financial statement information should contain the substance of this transaction and should not only record going by legality. In order to be reliable, the financial statements information should be neutral i.e., free from bias. The prepares of financial statements however, have to contend with the uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the collectability of doubtful receivables, the probable useful life of plant and equipment and the number of warranty claims that many occur. Such uncertainties are recognised by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by exercise of prudence in the preparation of financial statements. Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of judgement needed in making the estimates required under condition of uncertainty such that assets and income are not overstated and loss and liability are not understated.']\n",

If the financial accounting process is not properly regulated, there is possibility of financial statements being misleading, tendentious and providing a distorted picture of the business, rather than the true. To ensure transparency, consistency, comparability, adequacy and reliability of financial reporting, it is essential to standardize the accounting principles and policies. Accounting Standards (ASs) provide framework and standard accounting policies for treatment of transactions and events so that the financial statements of different enterprises become comparable.\\nAccounting standards are written policy documents issued by the expert accounting body or by the government or other regulatory body covering the aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of accounting transactions and events in the financial statements. The ostensible purpose of the standard setting bodies is to promote the dissemination of timely and useful financial information to investors and certain other parties having an interest in the company's economic performance. The accounting standards deal with the issues of -\\nrecognition of events and transactions in the financial statements;\\nmeasurement of these transactions and events;\\npresentation of these transactions and events in the financial statements in a manner that is meaningful and understandable to the reader; and\\nthe disclosure requirements which should be there to enable the public at large and the stakeholders and the potential investors in particular, to get an insight into what these financial statements are trying to reflect and thereby facilitating them to take prudent and informed business decisions.\", 'OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nThe whole idea of accounting standards is centered around harmonisation of accounting policies and practices followed by different business entities so that the diverse accounting practices adopted for various aspects of accounting can be standardised. Accounting Standards standardise diverse accounting policies with a view to:\\neliminate the non-comparability of financial statements and thereby improving the reliability of financial statements; and\\nprovide a set of standard accounting policies, valuation norms and disclosure requirements.\\nAccounting standards reduce the accounting alternatives in the preparation of financial statements within the bounds of rationality, thereby ensuring comparability of financial statements of different enterprises.', 'BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nAccounting standards seek to describe the accounting principles, the valuation techniques and the methods of applying the accounting principles in the preparation and presentation of financial statements so that they may give a true and fair view. By setting the accounting standards, the accountant has following benefits:\\nStandards reduce to a reasonable extent or eliminate altogether confusing variations in the accounting treatments used to prepare financial statements.\\nThere are certain areas where important information are not statutorily required to be disclosed. Standards may call for disclosure beyond that required by law.\\nThe application of accounting standards would, to a limited extent, facilitate comparison of financial statements of companies situated in different parts of the world and also of different companies situated in the same country. However, it should be noted in this respect that differences in the institutions, traditions and legal systems from one country to another give rise to differences in accounting standards adopted in different countries.\\nBenefits of Accounting Standards\\nAccounting standards provide several key advantages that are crucial for the uniformity and transparency of financial reporting:\\nStandardisation of Alternative Accounting Treatments: Accounting standards mitigate inconsistencies by standardizing various methods available for accounting treatments. This eliminates the discrepancies that can arise when different practices are applied to similar transactions.\\nRequirements for Additional Disclosures: They necessitate comprehensive disclosures that give users of financial statements a more complete understanding of the financial information presented. These disclosures are integral to ensuring that all relevant financial data is communicated effectively.\\nComparability of Financial Statements: One of the most significant benefits of accounting standards is the comparability they afford. By providing a consistent framework for financial reporting, these standards make it possible to compare financial statements across different periods and entities, enhancing the decision-making process for investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.\\nHowever, there are some limitations of accounting standards:\\nDifficulties in making choice between different treatments: Alternative solutions to certain accounting problems may each have arguments to recommend them. Therefore, the choice between different alternative accounting treatments may become difficult.\\nRestricted scope: Accounting standards cannot override the statute. The standards are required to be framed within the ambit of prevailing statutes.', 'PROCESS OF FORMULATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN INDIA\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), being a premier accounting body in the country, took upon itself the leadership role by constituting the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in 1977. The ICAI has taken significant initiatives in the setting and issuing procedure of Accounting Standards to ensure that the standard-setting process is fully consultative and transparent. The ASB considers International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) while framing Indian Accounting Standards (ASs) in India and try to integrate them, in the light of the applicable laws, customs, usages and business environment in the country. The composition of ASB includes, representatives of industries (namely, ASSOCHAM, CII, FICCI), regulators, academicians, government departments etc. Although ASB is a body constituted by the Council of the ICAI, it (ASB) is independent in the formulation of accounting standards and Council of the ICAI is not empowered to make any modifications in the draft accounting standards formulated by ASB without consulting with the ASB.\\nThe standard-setting procedure of Accounting Standards Board (ASB) can be briefly outlined as follows:\\nIdentification of broad areas by ASB for formulation of AS.\\nConstitution of study groups by ASB to consider specific projects and to prepare preliminary drafts of the proposed accounting standards. The draft normally includes objective and scope of the standard, definitions of the terms used in the standard, recognition and measurement principles wherever applicable and presentation and disclosure requirements.\\nConsideration of the preliminary draft prepared by the study group of ASB and revision, if any, of the draft on the basis of deliberations.\\nCirculation of draft of accounting standard (after revision by ASB) to the Council members of the ICAI and specified outside bodies such as Department of Company Affairs (DCA), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C&AG), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE), etc. for comments.\\nMeeting with the representatives of the specified outside bodies to ascertain their views on the draft of the proposed accounting standard.\\nFinalisation of the exposure draft of the proposed accounting standard and its issuance inviting public comments.\\nConsideration of comments received on the exposure draft and finalisation of the draft accounting standard by the ASB for submission to the Council of the ICAI for its consideration and approval for issuance.\\nConsideration of the final draft of the proposed standard and by the Council of the ICAI, and if found necessary, modification of the draft in consultation with the ASB is done.\\nThe accounting standard on the relevant subject (for non-corporate entities) is then issued by the ICAI. For corporate entities the accounting standards are issued by The Central Government of India.', \"LIST OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN INDIA\\nThe 'Accounting Standards' issued by the Accounting Standards Board establish standards which have to be complied by the business entities so that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\\nFollowing is the list of applicable Accounting Standards:\\nList of Accounting Standards\\nAS 1 detail the Disclosure of Accounting Policies.\\nAS 2 (Revised) pertains to the Valuation of Inventories.\\nAS 3 (Revised) is about Cash Flow Statements.\\nAS 4 (Revised) addresses Contingencies and Events Occurring after the Balance Sheet Date.\\nAS 5 (Revised) covers Net Profit or Loss for the Period, Prior Period Items, and Changes in Accounting Policies.\\nAS 7 (Revised) relates to Accounting for Construction Contracts.\\nAS 9 deals with Revenue Recognition.\\nAS 10 concerns Property, Plant and Equipment.\\nAS 11 (Revised) explains The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.\\nAS 12 involves Accounting for Government Grants.\\nAS 13 is related to Accounting for Investments.\\nAS 14 discusses Accounting for Amalgamations.\\nAS 15 (Revised) elaborates on Employee Benefits.\\nAS 16 is about Borrowing Costs.\\nAS 17 covers Segment Reporting.\\nAS 18 is concerned with Related Party Disclosures.\\nAS 19 pertains to Leases.\\nAS 20 deals with Earnings Per Share.\\nAS 21 involves Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAS 22 is related to Accounting for Taxes on Income.\\nAS 23 concerns Accounting for Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAS 24 addresses Discontinuing Operations.\\nAS 25 elaborates on Interim Financial Reporting.\\nAS 26 is about Intangible Assets.\\nAS 27 covers Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures.\\nAS 28 discusses Impairment of Assets.\\nAS 29 pertains to Provisions, Contingent Liabilities & Contingent Assets. \\u200b\\u200b\", 'Indian Accounting Standards (IND AS)\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) being the accounting standards-setting body in India, way back in 2006, initiated the process of moving towards the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) with a view to enhance acceptability and transparency of the financial information communicated by the Indian corporates through their financial statements. This move towards IFRS was subsequently accepted by the Government of India. The Government of India in consultation with the ICAI decided to converge and not to adopt IFRSs issued by the IASB. The decision of convergence rather than adoption was taken after the detailed analysis of IFRS requirements and extensive discussion with various stakeholders. Accordingly, while formulating IFRS- converged Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), efforts have been made to keep these Standards, as far as possible, in line with the corresponding IFRS and departures have been made where considered absolutely essential.

Policies are based on various accounting concepts, principles and conventions that have already been explained in Unit 2 of Chapter 1. There is no single list of accounting policies, which are applicable to all enterprises in all circumstances. Enterprises operate in diverse and complex environmental situations and so they have to adopt various policies. The choice of specific accounting policy appropriate to the specific circumstances in which the enterprise is operating, calls for considerate judgement by the management. ICAI has been trying to reduce the number of acceptable accounting policies through Guidance Notes and Accounting Standards in its combined efforts with the government, other regulatory agencies and progressive managements. Already it has achieved some progress in this respect.\\nThe areas wherein different accounting policies are frequently encountered can be given as follows:\\nValuation of Inventories;\\nValuation of Investments.\\nThis list should not be taken as exhaustive but is only illustrative. As the course will progress, students will see the intricacies of the various accounting policies.\\nSuppose an enterprise holds some investments in the form of shares of a company at the end of an accounting period. For valuation of shares, the enterprise may adopt FIFO, average method etc. The method selected by that enterprise for valuation is called an accounting policy.', 'SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nChoice of accounting policy is an important policy decision which affects the performance measurement as well as financial position of the business entity. Selection of inappropriate accounting policy may lead to understatement or overstatement of performance and financial position. Thus, accounting policy should be selected with due care after considering its effect on the financial performance of the business enterprise from the angle of various users of accounts.\\nIt is believed that no unified and exhaustive list of accounting policies can be suggested which has universal application. Three major characteristics which should be considered for the purpose of selection and application of accounting policies. viz., Prudence, Substance over form, and Materiality. The financial statements should be prepared on the basis of such accounting policies, which exhibit true and fair view of state of affairs of Balance Sheet and the Profit & Loss Account.\\nExamples wherein selection from a set of accounting policies is made, can be given as follows:-\\nInventories are valued at cost except for finished goods and by-products. Finished goods are valued at lower of cost or market value and by-products are valued at net realizable value.\\nInvestments (long term) are valued at their acquisition cost. Provision for permanent diminution in value has been made wherever necessary.\\nSometimes a wrong or inappropriate treatment is adopted for items in Balance Sheet, or Profit & Loss Account, or other statement. Disclosure of the treatment adopted is necessary in any case, but disclosure cannot rectify a wrong or inappropriate treatment.', 'CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nA change in accounting policies should be made in the following conditions:\\nIt is required by some statute or for compliance with an Accounting Standard\\nChange would result in more appropriate presentation of financial statement\\nChange in accounting policy may have a material effect on the items of financial statements. For example, if cost formula used for inventory valuation is changed from weighted average to FIFO, or if interest is capitalized which was earlier not in practice, or if proportionate amount of interest is changed to inventory which was earlier not the practice, all these may increase or decrease the net profit. Unless the effect of such change in accounting policy is quantified, the financial statements may not help the users of accounts. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the effect of change on financial statement items like assets, liabilities, profit/loss.\\nFor example, Omega Enterprises revised its accounting policy relating to valuation of inventories to include applicable production overheads. It intends to do as it believes that such change would result in a more appropriate presentation of its financial statements.']\n",

Primarily transactions and events are measured in terms of money. Any measurement discipline deals with three basic elements of measurement viz., identification of objects and events to be measured, selection of standard or scale to be used, and evaluation of dimension of measurement standards or scale.\\nProf. R. J. Chambers defined \\'measurement\\' as \"assignment of numbers to objects and events according to rules specifying the property to be measured, the scale to be used and the dimension of the unit\". (R.J. Chambers, Accounting Evaluation and Economic Behaviour, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 1966, P.10).\\nKohler defined measurement as the assignment of a system of ordinal or cardinal numbers to the results of a scheme of inquiry or apparatus of observations in accordance with logical or mathematical rules - [A Dictionary of Accountant].\\nOrdinal numbers, or ordinals, are numbers used to denote the position in an ordered sequence: first, second, third, fourth, etc., whereas a cardinal number says \\'how many there are\\': one, two, three, four, etc.\\nChambers\\' definition has been widely used to judge how far accounting can be treated as a measurement discipline.\\nAccording to this definition, the three elements of measurement are:\\nIdentification of objects and events to be measured;\\nSelection of standard or scale to be used;\\nEvaluation of dimension of measurement standard or scale.', \"OBJECTS OR EVENTS TO BE MEASURED\\nWe have earlier defined Accounting as the process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decisions by the users of the information. So accounting essentially includes measurement of 'information'.\\nDecision makers need past, present and future information. For external users, generally the past information is communicated.\\nThere is no uniform set of events and transactions in accounting which are required for decision making. For example, in cash management, various cash receipts and expenses are the necessary objects and events. Obviously, the decision makers need past cash receipts and expenses data along with projected receipts and expenses. For giving loan to a business one needs information regarding the repayment ability (popularly called debt servicing) of principal and interest. This also includes past information, current state of affairs as well as future projections. It may be mentioned that past and present objects and events can be measured with some degree of accuracy but future events and objects are only predicted, not measured. Prediction is an essential part of accounting information. Decision makers have to take decisions about the unseen future for which they need suitable information.\", 'STANDARD OR SCALE OF MEASUREMENT\\nIn accounting, money is the scale of measurement (see money measurement concept), although now-a- days quantitative information is also communicated along with monetary information.\\nMoney as a measurement scale has no universal denomination. It takes the shape of currency ruling in a country. For example, in India the scale of measurement is Rupee, in the U.K. Pound Sterling (  ), in Germany Deutschmark (DM), in the United States Dollar ($) and so on. Also there is no constant exchange relationship among the currencies.\\nIf one businessman in India took loan  from a businessman of the U.S.A., he would enter the transaction in his books in terms of ₹ Suppose at the time of loan agreement exchange rate was US . Then loan amounted to ₹ . Afterwards the exchange rate has been changed to . At the changed exchange rate the loan amount becomes₹ . So money as a unit of measurement lacks universal applicability across the boundary of a country unless a common currency is in vogue. Since the rate of exchange fluctuates between two currencies over the time, money as a measurement scale also becomes volatile.', 'DIMENSION OF MEASUREMENT SCALE\\nAn ideal measurement scale should be stable over time. For example, if one buys . cabbage today, the quantity he receives will be the same if he will buy . cabbage one year later. Similarly, length of 1 metre cloth will not change if it is bought a few days later. That is to say a measurement scale should be stable in dimension. Money as a scale of measurement is not stable. There occurs continuous change in the input output prices. The same quantity of money may not have the ability to buy same quantity of identical goods at different dates. Thus information of one year measured in money terms may not be comparable with that of another year. Suppose production and sales of a company in two different years are as follows:\\nIn Year 1, 5,000 pieces were valued at ₹5,00,000, while in Year 2, 4,500 pieces were valued at ₹5,40,000\\nLooking at the monetary figures one may be glad for  sales growth. In fact there was  production and sales decline. The growth envisaged through monetary figures is only due to price change. Let us suppose further that the cost of production for the above mentioned two years is as follows:\\nIn Year 1, the quantity was 5,000 pieces valued at ₹4,00,000; in Year 2, it was 4,500 pieces valued at ₹4,50,000.\\nTake Gross profit  Sales - Cost of Production. Then in the first year profit was ₹ 1,00,000 while in the second year the profit was ₹ 90,000 . There was  decline in gross profit.\\nSo, money as a unit of measurement is not stable in the dimension.\\nThus, Accounting measures information mostly in money terms which is not a stable scale having universal applicability and also not stable in dimension for comparison over the time. So it is not an exact measurement discipline.', \"ACCOUNTING AS A MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE\\nHow do you measure a transaction or an event? Unless the measurement base is settled we cannot progress to the record keeping function of book-keeping. It has been explained that accounting is meant for generating information suitable for users' judgments and decisions. But generation of such information is preceded by recording, classifying and summarising data. By that process it measures performance of the business entity by way of profit or loss and shows its financial position. Thus, measurement is an important part of accounting discipline. But a set of theorems governs the whole measurement sub- system. These theorems should be carefully understood to know how the cogs of the 'accounting-wheel' work. Now-a-days accounting profession earmarked three theorems namely going concern, consistency and accrual as fundamental accounting assumptions, i.e., these assumptions are taken for granted. Also while measuring, classifying, summarising and also presenting, various policies are adopted. Recording, classifying summarising and communication of information are also important part of accounting, which do not fall within the purview of measurement discipline. Therefore, we cannot simply say that accounting is a measurement discipline.\\nBut in accounting money is the unit of measurement. So, let us take one thing for granted that all transactions and events are to be recorded in terms of money only. Quantitative information is also required in many cases but such information is only supplementary to monetary information.\", 'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are:\\nHistorical Cost;\\nCurrent Cost:\\nRealizable Value;\\nPresent Value.\\nLet us discuss these principles in detail.\\nValuation Principles of Historical Cost: \\nIt means acquisition price. For example, the businessman paid  to purchase the machine and spend  on its installation, its acquisition price including installation charges is . The historical cost of machine would be ₹8,00,000.\\nAccording to this base, assets are recorded at an amount of cash or cash equivalent paid at the time of acquisition. Liabilities are recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business.\\nValuation Principles of Current Cost: \\nTake that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 at . As per historical cost base he has to record it at  i.e. the acquisition price. As on 1.1.2022, Mr. X found that it would cost ₹  to purchase that machine. Take also that Mr. X took loan from a bank as on 1.1.2011 ₹ 5,00,000 @ 18% p.a. repayable at the end of 15 th year together with interest. As on 1.1.2022 the bank announces  prepayment penalty on the loan amount if it is paid within 15 days starting from that day. As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000.\\nValuation Principles of Realisable Value: \\nSuppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently. Take also that Mr. X found that he had no money to pay off the bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 currently.\\nValuation Principles of Present Value: \\nSuppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference. Now think the machine purchased by Mr. X can work for another 10 years and is supposed to generate cash @ ₹ 1,00,000 p.a. Also take that bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 taken by Mr.  is to be repaid as on 31.12.2028. Annual interest is .', 'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles.

For example, the businessman paid  to purchase the machine and spend  on its installation, its acquisition price including installation charges is . The historical cost of machine would be ₹8,00,000.\\nAccording to this base, assets are recorded at an amount of cash or cash equivalent paid at the time of acquisition. Liabilities are recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business.\\nWhen a businessman, takes ₹ 5,00,000 loan from a bank @ 10% interest p.a., it is to be recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. Here the obligation is the repayment of loan as well as payment of interest at an agreed rate i.e. . Proceeds received are  - it is historical cost of the transactions.\\nTake another case regarding payment of income tax liability. You know every individual has to pay income tax on his income if it exceeds certain minimum limit. But the income tax liability is not settled immediately when one earns his income. The income tax authority settles it some time later, which is technically called assessment year. Then how does he record this liability? As per historical cost base it is to be recorded at an amount expected to be paid to discharge the liability.\\nCompanies usually apply historical cost method in case of long-term assets like machinery, furniture, licenses etc.', 'Valuation Principles of Current Cost: \\nTake that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 at . As per historical cost base he has to record it at  i.e. the acquisition price. As on 1.1.2022, Mr. X found that it would cost ₹  to purchase that machine. Take also that Mr. X took loan from a bank as on 1.1.2011 ₹ 5,00,000 @ 18% p.a. repayable at the end of 15 th year together with interest. As on 1.1.2022 the bank announces  prepayment penalty on the loan amount if it is paid within 15 days starting from that day. As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000.\\nCurrent cost gives an alternative measurement base. Assets are carried out at the amount of cash or cash equivalent that would have to be paid if the same or an equivalent asset was acquired currently. Liabilities are carried at the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents that would be required to settle the obligation currently.\\nSo as per current cost base, the machine value is  while the value of bank loan is ₹ 5,05,000.', 'Valuation Principles of Realisable Value: \\nSuppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently. Take also that Mr. X found that he had no money to pay off the bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 currently.\\nAs per realisable value, assets are carried at the amount of cash or cash equivalents that could currently be obtained by selling the assets in an orderly disposal. Haphazard disposal may yield something less. Liabilities are carried at their settlement values; i.e. the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents expressed to be paid to satisfy the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nSo, the machine should be recorded at ₹  the realisable value in an orderly sale while the bank loan should be recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 the settlement value in the normal course of business.\\nRealisable value concept is commonly applied in case of inventories. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.', \"Valuation Principles of Present Value: \\nSuppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference. Now think the machine purchased by Mr. X can work for another 10 years and is supposed to generate cash @ ₹ 1,00,000 p.a. Also take that bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 taken by Mr.  is to be repaid as on 31.12.2028. Annual interest is .\\nAs per present value, an asset is carried at the present discounted value of the future net cash inflows that the item is expected to generate in the normal course of business. Liabilities are carried at the present discounted value of future net cash outflows that are expected to be required to settle the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nThe concept of Present Value is common in case of accounting for investments and loans.\\nThe term 'discount', 'cash inflow' and 'cash outflow' need a little elaboration. ₹ 100 in hand as on 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 in hand as on 31.12.2022. There is a time gap of one year. If Mr. X had ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 he could use it at that time. If he received it only on 31.12.2022, he had to sacrifice his use for a year. The value of this sacrifice is called 'time value of money'. Mr.  would sacrifice i.e. he would agree to take money on 31.12.2022 if he had been compensated for the sacrifice. So a rational man will never exchange ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 with ₹ 100 to be received on 31.12.2022. Then ₹ 100 of 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 of 31.12.2022. To make the money receivable at a future date equal with the money of the present date it is to be devalued. Such devaluation is called discounting of future money.\\nPerhaps you know the compound interest rule: \\n Amount\\n Principal\\n interest \\n Time\\nThis equation gives the relationship between present money, principal and the future money amount. If  and  are given, to find out , the equation is to be changed slightly.\\n\\nUsing the equation one can find out the present value if he knows the values of  and .\\nSuppose , now what is the present value of  to be received as on 31.12.2022 (Take 1.1.2022 as the time of reference).\\n\\nSimilarly,\\nOn 31.12.2023, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹69,444.\\nOn 31.12.2024, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹57,870.\\nOn 31.12.2025, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹48,225.\\nOn 31.12.2026, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹40,188.\\nOn 31.12.2027, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹33,490.\\nOn 31.12.2028, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹27,908.\\nOn 31.12.2029, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹23,257.\\nOn 31.12.2030, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹19,381.\\nOn 31.12.2031, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹16,150. \\u200b\\nTotal of all these present values is ₹ 4,19,246. Since the machine purchased by Mr. X will produce cash equivalent to ₹ 4,19,246 in terms of present value, it is to be valued at such amount as per present value measurement basis.\\nHere, Mr.  will receive  at different points of time-these are cash inflows. In the other example, he has to pay interest and principal of bank loan-these are cash outflows.\\nPerhaps you also know the annuity rule:\\nPresent value of an Annuity or Re. A for  periods is\\nA = Annuity\\n interest\\n time , n.\\n\\nApplying this rule one can derive the present value of ₹ 1,00,000 for 10 years @ 20% p.a.\\n\\nSimilarly, the present value of bank loan is\\n\\n\\nThus, we get the four measurements as on 1.1.2022:\\nThe machine asset has a historical cost of ₹7,00,000, a current cost of ₹25,00,000, a realisable value of ₹20,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,19,246. The bank loan liability has a historical cost of ₹5,00,000, a current cost of ₹5,05,000, a realisable value of ₹5,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,70,094. \\u200b\\u200b\\nThe accounting system which we shall discuss in the remaining chapters is also called historical cost accounting. However, this need not mean that one shall follow only historical cost basis of accounting. In the later stages of the CA course, we shall see that the accounting system uses all types of measurement bases although under the traditional system most of the transactions and events are measured in terms of historical cost.\", 'MEASUREMENT AND VALUATION\\nValue relates to the benefits to be derived from objects, abilities or ideas. To the economist, value is the utility (i.e.; satisfaction) of an economic resource to the person contemplating or enjoying its use. In accounting, to mean value of an object, abilities or ideas, a monetary surrogate is used. That is to say, value is measured in terms of money. Suppose, an individual purchased a car paying . Its value lies in the satisfaction to be derived by that individual using the car in future. Economists often use ordinal scale to indicate the level of satisfaction. But accountants use only cardinal scales. If the value of car is taken as ₹ 2,50,000 it is only one type of value called acquisition cost or historical cost. So value is indicated by measurement. In accounting the value is always measured in terms of money.', 'ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\\nEarlier in this unit we have learned how to measure a transaction, which had already taken place and for which either some value/money has been paid or some valuation principles are to be adopted for their measurement. But there are certain items, which have not occurred therefore cannot be measured using valuation principles still they are necessary to record in the books of account, for example, provision for doubtful debts. For such items, we need some value. In such a situation reasonable estimates based on the existing situation and past experiences are made.\\nThe measurement of certain assets and liabilities is based on estimates of uncertain future events. As a result of the uncertainties inherent in business activities, many financial statement items cannot be measured with precision but can only be estimated. Therefore, the management makes various estimates and assumptions of assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses as on the date of preparation of financial statements. Such estimates are made in connection with the computation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses as well as, accruals, provisions and employee benefit obligations. Also estimates may be required in determining the bad debts, useful life and residual value of an item of plant and machinery and inventory obsolescence. The process of estimation involves judgements based on the latest information available.\\nAn estimate may require revision if changes occur regarding circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of new information, more experience or subsequent developments. Change in accounting estimate means difference arises between certain parameters estimated earlier and re-estimated during the current period or actual result achieved during the current period.\\nFew examples of situations wherein accounting estimates are needed can be given as follows:\\nA company incurs expenditure of  on development of patent. Now the company has to estimate that for how many years the patent would benefit the company. This estimation should be based on the latest information and logical judgement.\\nA company dealing in long-term construction contracts, uses percentage of completion method for recognizing the revenue at the end of the accounting year. Under this method the company has to make adequate provisions for unseen contingencies, which can take place while executing the remaining portion of the contract. Since provisioning for unseen contingencies requires estimation, there may be excess or short provisioning, which is to be adjusted in the period when it is recognised.\\nA company has to provide for taxes which is also based on estimation as there can be some interpretational differences on account of which tax authorities may either accept the expenditure or refuse it. This will ultimately lead to different tax liability.\\nCompany XY Ltd purchases a machine for ₹ 10 lac in 2021. The procurement head suggested that the machine is expected to offer benefits up to next 10 years. After 3 years of its use, the machine has become obsolete as new technologies are now available providing better productivity than the existing machine. Hence, it is now expected that the machine can only offer benefits for further 3 years. This is a change in estimate in the useful life of the machine.']), ('CA-FO-P1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1-U3-Capital and Revenue Expenditures and Receipts', ['Introduction of Capital and Revenue Expenditures and Receipts\\nAccounting aims in ascertaining and presenting the results of the business for an accounting period. For ascertaining the periodical business results, the nature of transactions should be analyzed whether they are of capital or revenue nature. Revenue Expense relates to the operations of the business of an accounting period or to the revenue earned during the period or the items of expenditure, benefits of which do not extend beyond that period. Capital Expenditure, on the other hand, generates enduring benefits and helps in revenue generation over more than one accounting period. Revenue Expenses must be associated with a physical activity of the entity. Therefore, whereas production and sales generate revenue in the earning process, use of goods and services in support of those functions causes expenses to occur.\\nExpenses are recognised in the Profit & Loss Account through matching principal which tells us when and how much of the expenses to be charged against revenue. A part of the expenditure can be capitalised only when these can be traced directly to definable streams of future benefits.\\nThe distinction of transaction into revenue and capital is done for the purpose of placing them in Profit and Loss account or in the Balance Sheet. For example: revenue expenditures are shown in the profit and loss account as their benefits are for one accounting period i.e., in which they are incurred while capital expenditures are placed on the asset side of the balance sheet as they will generate benefits for more than one accounting period and will be transferred to profit and loss account of the year on the basis of utilisation of that benefit in particular accounting year. Hence, both capital and revenue expenditures are ultimately transferred to profit and loss account.\\nRevenue expenditures are transferred to profit and loss account in the year of spending while capital expenditures are transferred to profit and loss account of the year in which their benefits are utilised. Therefore, we can conclude that it is the time factor, which is the main determinant for transferring the expenditure to profit and loss account. Also, expenses are recognized in profit and loss account through matching concept which tells us when and how much of the expenses to be charged against revenue. However, distinction between capital and revenue creates a considerable difficulty. In many cases borderline between the two is very thin.', 'CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINING CAPITAL AND REVENUE EXPENDITURES\\nThe basic considerations in distinction between capital and revenue expenditures are:\\nNature of business: For a trader dealing in furniture, purchase of furniture is revenue expenditure but for any other trade, the purchase of furniture should be treated as capital expenditure and shown in the balance sheet as asset. Therefore, the nature of business is a very important criteria in separating an expenditure between capital and revenue.\\nRecurring nature of expenditure: If the frequency of an expense is quite often in an accounting year then it is said to be an expenditure of revenue nature while nonrecurring expenditure is infrequent in nature and do not occur often in an accounting year. Monthly salary or rent is the example of revenue expenditure as they are incurred every month while purchase of assets is not the transaction done regularly therefore, classified as capital expenditure unless materiality criteria defines it as revenue expenditure.\\nPurpose of expenses: Expenses for repairs of machine may be incurred in course of normal maintenance of the asset. Such expenses are revenue in nature. On the other hand, expenditure incurred for major repair of the asset so as to increase its productive capacity is capital in nature. However, determination of the cost of maintenance and ordinary repairs which should be expensed, as opposed to a cost which ought to be capitalised, is not always simple.\\nEffect on revenue generating capacity of business: The expenses which help to generate income/ revenue in the current period are revenue in nature and should be matched against the revenue earned in the current period. On the other hand, if expenditure helps to generate revenue over more than one accounting period, it is generally called capital expenditure.\\nWhen expenditure on improvements and repair of a fixed asset is done, it has to be charged to Profit and Loss Account if the expected future benefits from fixed assets do not change, and it will be included in book value of fixed asset, where the expected future benefits from assets increase.\\nMateriality of the amount involved: Relative proportion of the amount involved is another important consideration in distinction between revenue and capital.', 'CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND REVENUE EXPENDITURES\\nAs we have already discussed, capital expenditure contributes to the revenue earning capacity of a business over more than one accounting period whereas revenue expense is incurred to generate revenue for a particular accounting period. The revenue expenses either occur in direct relation with the revenue or in relation with accounting periods, for example cost of goods sold, salaries, rent, etc. Cost of goods sold is directly related to sales revenue whereas rent is related to the particular accounting period. Capital expenditure may represent acquisition of any tangible or intangible fixed assets for enduring future benefits. Therefore, the benefits arising out of capital expenditure last for more than one accounting period whereas those arising out of revenue expenses expire in the same accounting period.', 'Key differences between Capital and Revenue Expenditures\\nPeriod of benefit: Capital expenditure is any expenditure incurred to provide a benefit over a long-term period. Revenue expenditure is any expenditure incurred to provide a benefit during the current period.\\nEnhancement vs Maintenance: Capital expenditure is incurred for the purpose of increasing the capacity of the business or to reduce the costs of the business. Revenue expenditure is incurred to maintain the earning capacity of the business.\\nExamples: Capital expenditure includes purchases of machines, cars, furniture, etc. Revenue expenditure includes repairs and maintenance, salaries of accounting staff, etc.', \"CAPITAL RECEIPTS AND REVENUE RECEIPTS\\nJust as a clear distinction between Capital and Revenue expenditure is necessary, in the same manner capital receipts must be distinguished from revenue receipts.\\nReceipts which are obtained in course of normal business activities are revenue receipts (e.g., receipts from sale of goods or services, interest income etc.). On the other hand, receipts which are not revenue in nature are capital receipts (e.g., receipts from sale of fixed assets or investments, secured or unsecured loans, owners' contributions etc.). Revenue and capital receipts are recognised on accrual basis as soon as the right of receipt is established. Revenue receipts should not be equated with the actual cash receipts. Revenue receipts are credited to the Profit and Loss Account.\\nOn the other hand, Capital receipts are not directly credited to Profit and Loss Account. For example, when a fixed asset is sold for ₹ 92,000 (cost ₹ 90,000), the capital receipts ₹ 92,000 is not credited to Profit and Loss Account. Profit or Loss on sale of fixed assets is calculated and credited to Profit and Loss Account,\\nSale Proceeds                                    ₹ 92,000\\nCost                                                   (₹ 90,000)\\nProfit                                                   ₹ 2,000\"]), ('CA-FO-P1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1-U4-Contingents Assets and Contingent Liabilities', ['CONTINGENT ASSETS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITES\\nCONTINGENT ASSET\\nA contingent asset may be defined as a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only after occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise. It usually arises from unplanned or unexpected events that give rise to the possibility of an inflow of economic benefits to the business entity. For example, a claim that an enterprise is pursuing through legal process, where the outcome is uncertain, is a contingent asset.\\nAs per the concept of prudence as well as the present accounting standards, an enterprise should not recognise a contingent asset. These assets are uncertain and may arise from a claim which an enterprise pursues through a legal proceeding. There is uncertainty in realisation of claim. It is possible that recognition of contingent assets may result in recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset no longer remains as contingent asset.\\nA contingent asset need not be disclosed in the financial statements. A contingent asset is usually disclosed in the report of the approving authority (Board of Directors in the case of a company, and the corresponding approving authority in the case of any other enterprise), if an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and if it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change occurs.', 'CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\\nThe term \\'Contingent liability\\' can be defined as\\na possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise; or\\na present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:\\nit is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or\\na reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made.\"\\nFor example- Mr. X sells a machine to Mr. Y. Any damages incurred by Mr. Y while using the machine need to be compensated by Mr. X. A few days later from the date of sale of machine, Mr.  received a notice from Mr. Y who is claiming damages of ₹ 20 lac. The notice mentioned that a worker met with an accident during the use of the machine and is required to be compensated.\\nThe receipt of this notice does not suggest that Mr. X is liable to pay the amount, although this needs to be investigated and confirmed, as whether the damage arose due to any defect in the machine or it is due to negligence while operating the machine. Although, the receipt of the notice results into an event which requires recognition of a contingent liability since there is a possible obligation, and that can only be confirmed in future.\\nTaking another example let us assume Mr. AB sells cars to its customers. One of the cars caught fire due to malfunctioning of a faulty part during the test drive by one of the customers. The customer has filed a court case seeking a claim of ₹ 50 lac due to the incidence.\\nWhile Mr. AB acknowledges that there is a present obligation, it is not certain that whether he is expected to pay for any damages. The final outcome will only be known during the court proceedings.\\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and may arise in future depending on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events [part (a) of the definition]. A contingent liability may also be a present obligation that arises from past events [(part (b) of the definition)].\\nAn enterprise should not recognise a contingent liability in balance sheet, however it is required to be disclosed in the notes to accounts, unless possibility of outflow of a resource embodying economic benefits is remote. These liabilities are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits has become probable.\\nIf it becomes probable that an outflow or future economic benefits will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognised in financial statements of the period in which the change in probability occurs except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made.', 'DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND LIABILITIES\\nThe distinction between a liability and a contingent liability is generally based on the judgement of the management. A liability is defined as the present financial obligation of an enterprise, which arises from past events. The settlement of a liability results in an outflow from the enterprises of resources embodying economic benefits. On the other hand, in the case of contingent liability, either outflow of resources to settle the obligation is not probable or the amount expected to be paid to settle the liability cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\\nExamples of contingent liabilities are claims against the enterprise not acknowledged as debts, guarantees given in respect of third parties, liability in respect of bills discounted and statutory liabilities under dispute etc. In addition to present obligations that are recognized as liabilities in the balance sheet, enterprises are required to disclose contingent liability in their balance sheets by way of notes.', 'DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS\\nProvision means \"any amount written off or retained by way of providing for depreciation, renewal or diminution in the value of assets or retained by way of providing for any known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with substantial accuracy\".\\nIt is important to know the difference between provisions and contingent liabilities. The distinction between both of them can be explained as follows:\\nProvision is a present liability of uncertain amount that can be reliably measured using substantial estimation, whereas a contingent liability is a potential obligation dependent on uncertain future events.\\nA provision satisfies the recognition criteria, while a contingent liability does not meet these criteria.\\nProvision is acknowledged when there is a current obligation from past events likely to result in an economic benefit outflow, and the amount can be reliably estimated; in contrast, a contingent liability includes obligations not recognized due to uncertainty in benefit outflow or amount estimation.\\nManagement recognizes a provision in the balance sheet if it is probable that fulfilling an obligation will result in economic benefits outflow; conversely, if economic benefits outflow is unlikely, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability. \\u200b\\nLet us take an example to understand the distinction between provisions and contingent liabilities. The Central Excise Officer imposes a penalty on Alpha Ltd. for violation of a provision in the Central Excise Act. The company goes on an appeal. If the management of the company estimates that it is probable that the company will have to pay the penalty, it recognises a provision for the liability. On the other hand, if the management anticipates that the judgement of the appellate authority will be in its favour and it is less likely that the company will have to pay the penalty, it will disclose the obligation as a contingent liability instead of recognising a provision for the same.']), ('CA-FO-P1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1-U1- Meaning and Scope of Accounting', [\"Introduction of Meaning and Scope of Accounting\\nEvery individual performs some kind of economic activity. A salaried person gets salary and spends to buy provisions and clothing, for children's education, construction of house, etc. A sports club formed by a group of individuals, a business run by an individual or a group of individuals, a company running a business in telecom sector, a local authority like Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Delhi Development Authority, Governments, either Central or State, all are carrying some kind of economic activities. Not necessarily all the economic activities are run for any individual benefit; such economic activities may create social benefit i.e. benefit for the public, at large. Anyway, such economic activities are performed through 'transactions and events'. Transaction is used to mean 'a business, performance of an act, an agreement' while event is used to mean 'a happening, as a consequence of transaction(s), a result.'\", 'MEANING OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe Committee on Terminology set up by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants formulated the following definition of accounting in 1961:\\n\"Accounting is the art of recording, classifying, and summarising in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of a financial character, and interpreting the result thereof.\"\\nAs per this definition, accounting is simply an art of record keeping. The process of accounting starts by first identifying the events and transactions which are of financial character and then be recorded in the books of account. Continuing with the same example of the telecom company, which needs to capture all transactions (transactions made by the user, raising invoice to the customer, receipt of money, payment towards salaries, marketing etc.). Likewise, the individual running the stationery business, would need to record all business transactions.\\nThis recording is done in Journal or subsidiary books, also known as primary books. Every good record keeping system includes suitable classification of transactions and events as well as their summarisation for ready reference. For example, the telecom company performing thousands of transactions on a daily basis, is not expected to publish all those transactions for the users to be able to make a decision. Surely, those transactions need to be summarized appropriately.\\nAfter the transactions and events are recorded, they are transferred to secondary books, i.e., Ledger. In ledger, transactions and events are classified in terms of income, expense, assets and liabilities according to their characteristics and summarised in profit and loss account and balance sheet.\\nEssentially the transactions and events are to be measured in terms of money. Measurement in terms of money means measuring at the ruling currency of a country, for example, rupee in India, dollar in U.S.A. and like. The transactions and events must have at least in part, financial characteristics. The inauguration of a new branch of a bank is an event without having financial character, while the business disposed of by the branch is an event having financial character. Accounting also interprets the recorded, classified and summarized transactions and events. However, the above-mentioned definition does not reflect the present day accounting function. According to the above definition, accounting ends with interpretation of the results of the financial transactions and events but in the modern world with the diversification of management and ownership, globalization of business and society gaining more interest in the functioning of the enterprises, the importance of communicating the accounting results has increased.\\nTherefore, this requirement of communicating and motivating informed judgement has also become the part of accounting as defined in the widely accepted definition of accounting, given by the American Accounting Association in 1966 which treated accounting as:\\n\"The process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgments and decisions by the users of accounts.\"\\nIn 1970, the Accounting Principles Board (APB) of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) enumerated the functions of accounting as follows:\\n\"The function of accounting is to provide quantitative information, primarily of financial nature, about economic entities, that is needed to be useful in making economic decisions.\"\\nThus, accounting may be defined as the process of recording, classifying, summarising, analysing and interpreting the financial transactions and communicating the results thereof to the persons interested in such information.\\nThe above definition requires accountants to assume a bigger responsibility than to merely do book-keeping. Accountants need to be ready to provide the information ready for the intended users to be able to make economic decisions.', 'Procedural aspects of Accounting\\nOn the basis of the above definitions, procedure of accounting can be basically divided into two parts:\\nGenerating financial information and\\nUsing the financial information.\\nGenerating Financial Information\\nRecording - This is the basic function of accounting. All business transactions of a financial character, as evidenced by some documents such as sales bill, pass book, salary slip etc. are recorded in the books of account. Recording is done in a book called \"Journal.\" This book may further be divided into several subsidiary books according to the nature and size of the business. Students will learn how to prepare journal and various subsidiary books in chapter 2.\\nClassifying - Classification is concerned with the systematic analysis of the recorded data, with a view to group transactions or entries of one nature at one place so as to put information in compact and usable form. The book containing classified information is called \"Ledger\". This book contains on different pages, individual account heads under which, all financial transactions of similar nature are collected. For example, there may be separate account heads for Salaries, Rent, Printing and Stationeries, Advertisement etc. All expenses under these heads, after being recorded in the Journal, will be classified under separate heads in the Ledger. This will help in finding out the total expenditure incurred under each of the above heads. Students will learn how to prepare ledger books in chapter 2.\\nSummarising - It is concerned with the preparation and presentation of the classified data in a manner useful to the internal as well as the external users of financial statements. This process leads to the preparation of the financial statements.\\nAnalysing - The term \\'Analysis\\' means methodical classification of the data given in the financial statements. The figures given in the financial statements will not help anyone unless they are in a simplified form. For example, all items relating to fixed assets are put at one place while all items relating to current assets are put at another place. It is concerned with the establishment of relationship between the items of the Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet i.e. it provides the basis for interpretation. Students will learn this aspect of financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course.\\nInterpreting - This is the final function of accounting. It is concerned with explaining the meaning and significance of the relationship as established by the analysis of accounting data. The recorded financial data is analysed and interpreted in a manner that will\\nenable the end-users to make a meaningful judgement about the financial condition and profitability of the business operations. The financial statement should explain not only what had happened but also why it happened and what is likely to happen under specified conditions.\\nCommunicating - It is concerned with the transmission of summarised, analysed and interpreted information to the end-users to enable them to make rational decisions. This is done through preparation and distribution of accounting reports, which include besides the usual profit and loss account and the balance sheet, additional information in the form of accounting ratios, graphs, diagrams, fund flow statements etc. Students will learn this aspect of financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course.\\nThe first two procedural stages of the process of generating financial information along with the preparation of trial balance are covered under book-keeping while the preparation of financial statements and its analysis, interpretation and also its communication to the various users are considered as accounting stages. Students will learn the term book-keeping and its distinction with accounting, in the coming topics of this unit.', \"Using the Financial Information\\nThere are certain users of accounts. Earlier it was viewed that accounting is meant for the proprietor or owner of the business, but changing social relationships diluted the earlier thinking. Since earlier businesses were simple and not scaled, probably that view could hold true for those.\\nIt is now believed that besides the owner or the management of the business enterprise, users of accounts include the investors, employees, lenders, suppliers, customers, government and other agencies and the public at large. For example, if an airlines company borrows money from a bank, buys oil from oil companies, sells tickets to the customers, has staff to be paid salaries to, all these group of people and entities are key stakeholders in that airlines business. They would like to know and understand whether the business of the company is going well or there are challenges for the company to run the business. Accounting provides the art of presenting information systematically to the users of accounts.\\nAccounting data is more useful if it stresses economic substance rather than technical form. Information is useless and meaningless unless it is relevant and material to a user's decision. The information should also be free of any biases. The users should understand not only the financial results depicted by the accounting figures, but also should be able to assess its reliability and compare it with information about alternative opportunities and the past experience. The owners or the management of the enterprise, commonly known as internal users, use the accounting information in an analytical manner to take the valuable decisions for\\nthe business. So the information served to them is presented in a manner different to the information presented to the external users. Even the small details which can affect the internal working of the business are given in the management report while financial statements presented to the external users contains key information regarding assets, liabilities and capital which are summarised in a logical manner that helps them in their respective decision-making.\", \"EVOLUTION OF ACCOUNTING AS A SOCIAL SCIENCE\\nHistory & Development of Accounting\\nAccounting finds its roots as early as around 4000 BC, where Egyptians used some form of accounting for their treasuries. The in-charge of treasuries had to send day wise reports to their superiors known as Wazirs and monthly reports were sent to kings. Babylonia, known as the city of commerce, used accounting for business to identify the losses that took place due to frauds and lack of efficiency. Greece used accounting to divide the revenues received among treasuries, maintaining receipts, payments and balance of government financial transactions. Romans used memorandum or daybook where in receipts and payments were recorded. (700 B.C to 400 A.D).\\nChina used sophisticated form of government accounting as early as 2000 B.C. Accounting practices in India could be traced back to a period where, Kautilya, a minister in Chandragupta's kingdom wrote a book named Arthashasthra, which also described how accounting records had to be maintained.\\nLuca Pacioli's, a Franciscan friar (merchant class), book Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportion at Proportionality (Review of Arithmetic and Geometric proportions) in Venice (1494) is considered as the first book on double entry bookkeeping. A portion of this book contains knowledge of business and book-keeping. He used the terms Debit (Dr.) and Credit (Cr.) in his books. These were the concepts used in Italian terminology. Debit comes from the Italian debito which comes from the Latin debita and debeo which means owed to the proprietor. Credit comes from the Italian credito which comes from the Latin 'credo' which means trust or belief (in the proprietor or owed by the proprietor.\\nIn explaining double entry system, Pacioli wrote that 'All entries... have to be double entries, that is if you make one creditor, you must make some debtor'. He also mentioned that a merchant's responsibility is to give glory to God in their enterprises, to be ethical in all business activities and to earn a profit. He discussed the details of memorandum, journal, ledger and specialised accounting procedures.\\nIn its oldest form, accounting aided the stewards to discharge their stewardship function. The wealthy men employed stewards to manage their property; the stewards in turn rendered an account periodically of their stewardship. This 'Stewardship Accounting' was the root of financial accounting system. Although double-entry system was followed, 'stewardship accounting' served the purpose of businessmen and wealthy persons at that time. In most of the countries, stewardship accounting was prevalent till the emergence of large-scale enterprises in the form of public limited companies.\\nIn the second phase, the idea of financial accounting emerged with the concept of joint stock company and divorce of ownership from the management. To safeguard the interest of the shareholders and investors, disclosure of financial statements (mainly, profit and loss account and balance sheet) and other accounting information was moulded by law. Financial statements give periodic performance report by way of profit and loss account and financial position at the end of the period by way of Balance Sheet. It got the legal status due to changing relationships between the owners, economic entity and the managers. With the democratisation of society, the relationships between the enterprise on the one hand, the investors, employees, managers and governments on the other, have also undergone a seachange. Also, the prospective investors and other business contact groups want to know a lot about the business before entering into transactions. Thus, financial accounting emerged as an information system to identify, measure and communicate useful information for informed judgements and decisions by a broad group of users. In the third phase, accounting information was generated to aid management decision- making in particular. It contributed a lot to improve the quality of management decisions. This new dimension of accounting is called Management Accounting and it is the development of 20th Century only. It is pervasive enough to cover all spheres of management decisions.\\nLastly, Social Responsibility Accounting is in the formative process, which aims at accounting for the social cost incurred by business as well as the social benefit, created by it. It emerges from the growing social awareness about the undesirable by-products of economic activities. While earning profit, an enterprise incurs numerous social costs like pollution, using the resources of society like materials, land, labour etc. To compensate for this social cost, in today's world, an enterprise is expected to generate some social benefits also like employment opportunities, recreation activities, more choice to customers at reasonable price, better quality products etc. Therefore, it is demanded that the accounting system should produce a report measuring the social cost incurred and social benefits generated.\\nSocial Science study man as a member of society; they concern about social processes and the results and consequences of social relationships. The usefulness of accounting to society as a whole is the fundamental criterion to treat it as a social science. Although individuals may benefit from the availability of accounting information, the accounting system generates information for social good. It serves social purpose, it contributes for social progress; also it is being adapted to keep pace with social progress. So, accounting is treated as a social science.\", \"OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe objectives of accounting can be given as follows:\\nSystematic recording of transactions - Basic objective of accounting is to systematically record the financial aspects of business transactions, i.e., book-keeping. These recorded transactions are later on classified and summarized logically for the preparation of financial statements and for their analysis and interpretation.\\nAscertainment of results of above recorded transactions - Accountant prepares profit and loss account to know the results of business operations for a particular period of time. If revenue (Sales) exceeds expenses then it is said that business is running profitably but if expenses exceed revenue, then it can be said that business is running under loss. The profit and loss account helps the management and different stakeholders in taking rational decisions. For example, if business is not proved to be remunerative or profitable, the cause of such a state of affair can be investigated by the management for taking remedial steps.\\nAscertainment of the financial position of the business - A businessman is not only interested in knowing the results of the business in terms of profits or loss for a particular period but is also anxious to know that what he owes (liability) to the outsiders and what he owns (assets) on a certain date. To know this, accountant prepares a financial position statement popularly known as Balance Sheet. The balance sheet is a statement of assets and liabilities of the business at a particular point of time and helps in ascertaining the financial health of the business.\\nProviding information to the users for rational decision-making - Accounting as a 'language of business' communicates the financial results of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. Accounting aims to meet the information needs of the decision-makers and helps them in rational decision-making.\\nTo know the solvency position - By preparing the balance sheet, management not only reveals what is owned and owed by the enterprise, but also it gives the information regarding concern's ability to meet its liabilities in the short run (liquidity position) and also in the long-run (solvency position) as and when they fall due.\", 'An overview of objectives of accounting is depicted  below:\\nObjectives of Accounting\\nAccounting aims to fulfill several key objectives, which are essential for the proper management and financial transparency of a business or organization:\\nSystematic Recording of Transactions: The foundation of accounting is the methodical recording of all business transactions. This is achieved through the process of bookkeeping, which utilizes tools such as:\\nJournal: A chronological record of all transactions.\\nLedger: A set of accounts where transactions are categorized.\\nTrial Balance: A statement that ensures that the sum of debits equals the sum of credits, verifying the mathematical accuracy of the bookkeeping.\\nAscertainment of Results: Accounting helps in determining the operational outcome of a business over a period, usually in terms of profit or loss. This is done through:\\nManufacturing Account: A statement showing the cost of production.\\nTrading Account: A summary of the trading activities, showing the gross profit or loss.\\nProfit and Loss Account: An account that details the expenses and revenues, culminating in the net profit or loss.\\nAscertainment of Financial Position: Through accounting, a business can determine its financial standing at a specific point in time. This objective is primarily achieved by preparing:\\nBalance Sheet: A financial statement that lists assets, liabilities, and equity, depicting the financial position of the business.\\nCommunicating Information to Various Users: Accounting serves to communicate financial information to a diverse set of users, which is crucial for decision-making. The information is disseminated through:\\nFinancial Reports: Documents such as income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and equity statements that provide detailed financial information to stakeholders.\\nThese objectives are integral to the discipline of accounting, ensuring that all financial information is recorded accurately, results are clearly ascertained, financial positions are transparent, and information is effectively communicated to all relevant stakeholders.', 'Top of Form\\nFUNCTIONS OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe main functions of accounting are as follows:\\nMeasurement: Accounting measures past performance of the business entity and depicts its current financial position.\\nForecasting: Accounting helps in forecasting future performance and financial position of the enterprise using past data and analysing trends.\\nDecision-making: Accounting provides relevant information to the users of accounts to aid rational decision-making.\\nComparison & Evaluation: Accounting assesses performance achieved in relation to targets and discloses information regarding accounting policies and contingent liabilities which play an important role in predicting, comparing and evaluating the financial results.\\nControl: Accounting also identifies weaknesses of the operational system and provides feedbacks regarding effectiveness of measures adopted to check such weaknesses.\\nGovernment Regulation and Taxation: Accounting provides necessary information to the government to exercise control on the entity as well as in collection of tax revenues.', \"BOOK-KEEPING\\nBook-keeping is an activity concerned with the recording of financial data relating to business operations in a significant and orderly manner. It covers procedural aspects of accounting work and embraces record keeping function. Obviously, book-keeping procedures are governed by the end product, the financial statements. The term 'financial statements' means Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet and cash flow statements including Schedules and Notes forming part of Accounts.\\nBook-keeping also requires suitable classification of transactions and events. This is also determined with reference to the requirement of financial statements. A book-keeper may be responsible for keeping all the records of a business or only of a minor segment, such as position of the customers' accounts in a departmental store. Accounting is based on a careful and efficient book-keeping system.\\nThe essential idea behind maintaining book-keeping records is to show correct position regarding each head of income and expenditure. A business may purchase goods on credit as well as in cash. When the goods are bought on credit, a record must be kept of the person to whom money is owed. The proprietor of the business may like to know, from time to time, what amount is due on credit purchase and to whom. If proper record is not maintained, it is not possible to get details of the transactions in regard to the income and expenses. At the end of the accounting period, the proprietor wants to know how much profit has been earned or loss has been incurred during the course of the period. For this lot of information is needed which can be gathered from a proper record of the transactions. Therefore, in book-keeping, the proper maintenance of books of account is indispensable for any business.\\nAt this level, the major concern of the curriculum is with book-keeping and preparation of financial statements. It seems important to mention at this point that book-keeping and preparation of financial statements have legal implications also. Maintenance of books of accounts and the preparation of financial statements of a company are guided by the Companies Act, banks and insurance companies by special Acts governing these institutions and so on. However, for sole-proprietorship and partnership business, there is no specific legislation regarding maintenance of books of accounts and preparation of financial statements.\", 'Objectives of Book-keeping\\nComplete Recording of Transactions - It is concerned with complete and permanent record of all transactions in a systematic and logical manner to show its financial effect on the business.\\nAscertainment of financial Effect on the Business - It is concerned with the combined effect of all the transactions made during the accounting period upon the financial position of the business as a whole.', 'DISTINCTION BETWEEN BOOK-KEEPING AND ACCOUNTING\\nSome people mistake book-keeping and accounting to be synonymous terms, but in fact they are different from each other. Accounting is a broad subject. It calls for a greater understanding of records obtained from book-keeping and an ability to analyse and interpret the information provided by book-keeping records. Book-keeping is the recording phase while accounting is\\nconcerned with the summarising phase of an accounting system. Book-keeping provides necessary data for accounting and accounting starts where book-keeping ends.\\nTop of Form\\nBook-keeping: This is a process primarily concerned with the systematic recording of financial transactions.\\nAccounting: This process entails summarizing and interpreting the transactions that have been recorded during book-keeping.\\nBook-keeping: It lays the foundation for the accounting process.\\nAccounting: It acts as a comprehensive language that communicates the financial health and performance of a business.\\nBook-keeping: The creation of financial statements is not a function of book-keeping.\\nAccounting: Financial statements are generated within this process, utilizing the initial records from book-keeping.\\nBook-keeping: It does not provide the necessary information for managerial decision-making.\\nAccounting: It enables management to make informed decisions based on the analysis of book-keeping records.\\nBook-keeping: This field does not extend into specialized sub-categories.\\nAccounting: It encompasses various sub-disciplines, such as financial accounting and management accounting.\\nBook-keeping: The financial position of a business cannot be deduced solely from book-keeping records.\\nAccounting: It allows for the determination of the financial position through detailed accounting reports derived from book-keeping data.\\nThis comparative outline clarifies the distinct roles and contributions of book-keeping and accounting within the financial recording and reporting processes of a business.', \"Relationship of Accounting and Book-keeping can be depicted in the following chart as\\nThe Hierarchy of Financial Recording and Reporting\\nThe field of financial management is structured into distinct yet interrelated layers, each building upon the foundational practices of the previous one. This hierarchy can be visualized as:\\nAccountancy: This is the broadest category within this financial hierarchy. It encompasses all the activities related to the management of financial information, including the processes of accounting and bookkeeping, along with the analytical tasks that inform strategic decision-making.\\nAccounting: Nested within accountancy, accounting refers to the systematic process of recording, summarizing, and reporting the financial transactions of a business. It provides a comprehensive view of the financial activities through the creation of various financial statements and reports.\\nBookkeeping: At the core of this hierarchy lies bookkeeping, which is a subset of accounting. It is the initial phase of the accounting process, focusing on the meticulous and detailed recording of each financial transaction in chronological order. Bookkeeping is essential for providing the raw financial data that will be further analyzed and interpreted in the accounting process.\\nIn essence, bookkeeping serves as the groundwork for accounting, which in turn is a critical component of the broader discipline of accountancy. Each level in this hierarchy is crucial for the accurate and effective management of a business's financial information.\", 'SUB-FIELDS OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe various sub-fields of accounting are:\\nFinancial Accounting - It covers the preparation and interpretation of financial statements and communication to the users of accounts. It is historical in nature as it records transactions which had already been occurred. The final step of financial accounting is the preparation of Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet. It primarily helps in determination of the net result for an accounting period and the financial position as on the given date.\\nManagement Accounting - It is concerned with internal reporting to the managers of a business unit. To discharge the functions of stewardship, planning, control and decision- making, the management needs variety of information. The different ways of grouping information and preparing reports as desired by managers for discharging their functions are referred to as management accounting. A very important component of the management accounting is cost accounting which deals with cost ascertainment and cost control. Management Accounting will be dealt with at higher levels of the Chartered Accountancy Course.\\nCost Accounting - The terminology of Cost Accounting published by the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of England defines cost accounting as:\\n\"the process of accounting for cost which begins with the recording of income and expenditure or the bases on which they are calculated and ends with the preparation of periodical statements and reports for ascertaining and controlling costs.\"\\nSocial Responsibility Accounting - The demand for social responsibility accounting stems from increasing social awareness about the undesirable by-products of economic activities. As already discussed earlier, social responsibility accounting is concerned with accounting for social costs incurred by the enterprise and social benefits created.\\nHuman Resource Accounting - Human resource accounting is an attempt to identify, quantify and report investments made in human resources of an organisation that are not presently accounted for under conventional accounting practice.', \"USERS OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\\nGenerally users of accounts are classified into two categories, (a) internal users and (b) external users. Management accounting is concerned with identifying information requirements as well as methods of providing such information to management while information requirements of the outside users are generally served by financial statements. Following are the various users of accounting information:\\nInvestors: They provide risk capital to the business. They need information to assess whether to buy, hold or sell their investment. Also they are interested to know the ability of the business to survive, prosper and to pay dividend. In non-corporate sector, where ownership and management are not essentially separated, the owners still need information about performance of the business and its financial position to decide whether to continue or shut down.\\nEmployees: Growth of the employees is directly related to the growth of the organisation and therefore, they are interested to know the stability, continuity and growth of the enterprise and its ability to provide remuneration, retirement and other benefits and to enhance employment opportunities.\\nLenders: They are interested to know whether their loan-principal and interest will be paid back when due.\\nSuppliers and Creditors: They are also interested to know the ability of the enterprise to pay their dues, that helps them to decide the credit policy for the relevant concern, rates to be charged and so on. Sometimes, they also become interested in long-term continuation of the enterprise if their existence becomes dependent on the survival of that business.\\nCustomers: Customers are also concerned with the stability and profitability of the enterprise because their functioning is more or less dependent on the supply of goods, suppose, a company produces some chemicals used by pharmaceutical companies and supplies chemicals on three month's credit. If all of a sudden it faces some trouble and is unable to supply the chemical, the customers will also be in trouble.\\nGovernment and their agencies: They regulate the functioning of business enterprises for public good, allocate scarce resources among competing enterprises, control prices, charge excise duties and taxes, and so they have continued interest in the business enterprise.\\nPublic: The public at large is interested in the functioning of the enterprise because it may make a substantial contribution to the local economy in many ways including the number of people employed and their patronage to local suppliers.\\nManagement: Management as whole is also interested in the accounts for various managerial decisions. On the basis of the accounts, management determines the effects of their various decisions on the functioning of the organisation. This helps them to make further managerial decisions.\", \"RELATIONSHIP OF ACCOUNTING WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES\\nAccounting is closely related with several other disciplines and thus to acquire a good knowledge in accounting one should be conversant with the relevant portions of such disciplines. In many cases they overlap accounting. The accountant should have a working knowledge of the related disciplines so that he can understand such overlapping areas and apply the knowledge of other disciplines in his own work wherever possible, or he can take the expert advice.\\nAccounting and Economics: Economics is viewed as a science of rational decisionmaking about the use of scarce resources. It is concerned with the analysis of efficient use of scarce resources for satisfying human wants. This may be viewed either from the perspective of a single firm or of the country as a whole.\\nAccounting and Statistics: The use of statistics in accounting can be appreciated better in the context of the nature of accounting records. Accounting information is very precise; it is exact to the last paisa. But, for decision-making purposes such precision is not necessary and hence, the statistical approximations are sought.\\nAccounting and Mathematics: Double Entry book-keeping can be converted in algebraic form; in fact the first known book on this subject was part of a treatise on algebra. The fundamental accounting equation will be discussed in detail under 'Dual Aspect Concept' of this chapter.\\nAccounting and Law: An economic entity operates within a legal environment. All transactions with suppliers and customers are governed by the Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act, the Negotiable Instruments Act, etc. The entity itself is created and controlled by laws. For example, a company is created by the Companies Act and also controlled by Companies Act.\\nAccounting and Management: Management is a broad occupational field, which comprises many functions and encompasses application of many disciplines including those mentioned above. Accountants are well placed in the management and play a key role in the management team. A large portion of accounting information is prepared for management decision-making. Although management relies on other data sources, accounting data are used as basic source documents. In the management team, an accountant is in a better position to understand and use such data. In other words, since an accountant plays an active role in management, he understands the data requirements. So the accounting system can be moulded to serve the management purpose.\", \"RELATIONSHIP OF ACCOUNTING WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES\\nAccounting is closely related with several other disciplines and thus to acquire a good knowledge in accounting one should be conversant with the relevant portions of such disciplines.

It is concerned with the analysis of efficient use of scarce resources for satisfying human wants. This may be viewed either from the perspective of a single firm or of the country as a whole.\\nAccounting is viewed as a system, which provides data to the users to permit informed judgement and decisions. Some non-accounting data are also relevant for decision making.\\nAccounting overlaps economics in many respects. It contributed a lot in improving the management decision-making process. But, economic theories influenced the development of the decision-making tools used in accounting.\\nHowever, there exists a wide gulf between economists' and accountants' concepts of income and capital. Accountants got the ideas of value, income and capital maintenance from economists, but brushed suitably to make them usable in practical circumstances. Accountants developed the valuation, measurement and decisionmaking techniques which may owe to the economic theorems for origin but these are moulded in the work environment and suitably tempered with reference to relevance, verifiability, freedom from bias, timeliness, comparability, reliability and understandability.\\nAn example may be given to explain the nexus between accounting and economics. Economists think that value of an asset is the present value of all future earnings which can be derived from such assets. Now think about a plant whose working life is more than one hundred years. How can you estimate future stream of earnings? So accountants developed the workable valuation base - the acquisition cost i.e., the price paid to acquire the assets.\\nAt the macro-level, accounting provides the database over which the economic decision models have been developed; micro-level data arranged by the accounting system is summed up to get macro-level database.\\nNon-overlapping zones of accounting are not negligible. Development of the systems of recording, classifying and summarising transactions and events, harmonising the systems by uniform rules and communicating the data is essentially a non-overlapping area of accounting.\", 'Relationship of Accounting and Statistics: The use of statistics in accounting can be appreciated better in the context of the nature of accounting records. Accounting information is very precise; it is exact to the last paisa. But, for decision-making purposes such precision is not necessary and hence, the statistical approximations are sought.\\nIn accounts, all values are important individually because they relate to business transactions. As against this, statistics is concerned with the typical value, behaviour or trend over a period of time or the degree of variation over a series of observations. Therefore, wherever a need arises for only broad generalisations or the average of relationships, statistical methods have to be applied in accounting data.\\nFurther, in accountancy, the classification of assets and liabilities as well as the heads of income and expenditure has been done as per the needs of financial recording to ascertain financial results of various operations. Other types of classification like the geographical and historical ones and ad hoc classification are done depending on the purpose to make such classification meaningful.\\nAccounting records generally take a short-term view of events and are confined to a year while statistical analysis is more useful if a longer view is taken for the purpose. For example, to fit the trend line a longer period will be required. However, statistical methods do use past accounting records maintained on a consistent basis.\\nThe functional relations showing mathematical relations of one variable with one or more other variables are based on statistical work. These relations are used widely in making cost or price estimates for some estimated future values assigned to the given independent variables. For example, given the functional relation of total cost to the price of an input, the effect of changes in future prices on the cost of production can be calculated.\\nIn accountancy, a number of financial and other ratios are based on statistical methods, which help in averaging them over a period of time. Several accounting and financial calculations are based on statistical formulae.\\nStatistical methods are helpful in developing accounting data and in their interpretation. For example, time series and cross-sectional comparison of accounting data is based on statistical techniques. Now- a-days multiple discriminate analysis is popularly used to identify symptoms of sickness of a business firm. Therefore, the study and application of statistical methods would add extra edge to the accounting data.', \"Relationship of Accounting and Mathematics: Double Entry book-keeping can be converted in algebraic form; in fact the first known book on this subject was part of a treatise on algebra. The fundamental accounting equation will be discussed in detail under 'Dual Aspect Concept' of this chapter.\\nKnowledge of arithmetic and algebra is a pre-requisite for accounting computations and measurements. Calculations of interest and annuity are the examples of such fundamental uses. While computing depreciation, finding out installments in hire purchase and instalments payment transactions, calculating amount to be set aside for repayment of loan and replacement of assets and calculating lease rentals, mathematical techniques are frequently used. Accounting data are also presented in ratio form.\\nWith the advent of the computer, mathematics is becoming a vital part of accounting. Instead of writing accounts in traditional fashion, the transactions and events can be recorded in the matrix form and the rules of matrix algebra can be applied for classifying and summarising data.\\nNow-a-days statistics and econometric models are largely used for developing decision models for the users of accounts. Also, Operations Research Techniques provide lot of decision models. Since accounting is meant for providing information to the users, to be effective, accounting data should feed the information requirements of such statistical, econometric and operations research models. Understanding mathematics has become a must to grasp the decision models framed by statisticians, econometricians and the O.R. experts.\\nPresently graphs and charts are being extensively used for communicating accounting information. In addition to statistical knowledge, knowledge in geometry and trigonometry seems to be essential to have a better understanding about the accounting communications system.\", 'Relationship of Accounting and Law: An economic entity operates within a legal environment. All transactions with suppliers and customers are governed by the Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act, the Negotiable Instruments Act, etc. The entity itself is created and controlled by laws. For example, a company is created by the Companies Act and also controlled by Companies Act.\\nSimilarly, every country has a set of economic, fiscal and labour laws. Transactions and events are always guided by laws of the land. Very often the accounting system to be followed has been prescribed by the law. For example, the Companies Act has prescribed the format of financial statements for companies.\\nBanking, insurance and electric supply undertakings may also have to produce financial statements as prescribed by the respective legislations controlling such entities.\\nHowever, legal prescription about the accounting system is the product of developments in accounting knowledge. That is to say, legislation about accounting system cannot be enacted unless there is a corresponding development in the accounting discipline. In that way accounting influences law and is also influenced by law.', 'Relationship of Accounting and Management: Management is a broad occupational field, which comprises many functions and encompasses application of many disciplines including those mentioned above.

In other words, since an accountant plays an active role in management, he understands the data requirements. So the accounting system can be moulded to serve the management purpose.', \"Relationship of Limitations of Accounting\\nThere are certain misconceptions regarding financial statements. A common man presumes that an income statement shows the correct income or loss of the enterprise and that a balance sheet depicts a perfectly true and fair picture of financial standing of that enterprise. It must be recognised that the accounting as a language has its own limitations. The figures of profit or loss generated by the accounting process are subject to various constraints within which the accounting works. The assumptions and conventions, on which the accounting is based, become the limitations of accounting. The financial statements are never free from subjectivity factor as these are largely the outcome of personal judgement of the accountant with regard to the adoption of the accounting policies. Following are certain instances:\\nThe factors which may be relevant in assessing the worth of the enterprise don't find place in the accounts as they cannot be measured in terms of money. The Balance sheet cannot reflect the value of certain factors like loyalty and skill of the personnel which may be the most valuable asset of an enterprise these days.\\nBalance Sheet shows the position of the business on the day of its preparation and not on the future date while the users of the accounts are interested in knowing the position of the business in the near future and also in long run and not for the past date.\\nAccounting ignores changes in some money factors like inflation etc.\\nThere are occasion when accounting principles conflict with each other.\\nCertain accounting estimates depend on the sheer personal judgement of the accountant, e.g., provision for doubtful debts, method of depreciation adopted, recording certain expenditure as revenue expenditure or capital expenditure, selection of method of valuation of inventories and the list is quite long.\\nFinancial statements consider those assets which can be expressed in monetary terms. Human resources although the very important asset of the enterprise are not shown in the balance sheet. There is no generally accepted formula for the valuation of human resources in money terms.\\nDifferent accounting policies for the treatment of same item adds to the probability of manipulations. Though through various laws and Accounting Standards, efforts are made to reduce these options to minimum but certainly could not be reduced to one.\\nIn nutshell, it can be said that the language of accounting has certain practical limitations and, therefore, the financial statements should be interpreted carefully keeping in mind all various factors influencing the true picture.\", 'ROLE OF ACCOUNTANT IN THE SOCIETY\\nThere are only a few types of profession in the world which are held in high esteem in public eyes and there is no denying the fact that the accounting profession is one of them. Goethe had called the accountant’s profession as ‘the fairest invention of the human mind’. At the core of all types of learned profession, there is the desire of public good and of finding the best way to serve society. By the use of the science of accountancy and under the spell of its art, a dynamic pattern which assists business in planning its future is woven by accountants out of the inert mass of non-speaking silent figures. This is what makes their profession an instrument of socio-economic change and welfare of the society.\\nAn accountant with his education, training, analytical mind and experience is best qualified to provide multiple need-based services to the ever growing society. The accountants of today can do full justice not only to matters relating to taxation, costing, management accounting, financial lay-out, company legislation and procedures but they can delve deep into the fields relating to financial policies, budgetary policies and even economic principles. The area of activities which can be undertaken by the accountants is not limited but it can also cover many additional facets.', \"Areas of Service\\nThe practice of accountancy has crossed its usual domain of preparation of financial statements, interpretation of such statements and audit thereof. Accountants are presently taking active role in company laws and other corporate legislation matters, in taxation laws matters (both direct and indirect) and in general management problems. Some of the services rendered by accountants to the society are briefly mentioned hereunder:\\nMaintenance of Books of Accounts: An accountant is able to maintain a systematic record of financial transactions in order to establish the net result of the transactions entered into during a period and to state the financial position of the concern as at a particular date.\\nFor the fulfillment of the twin objective of ascertaining the profit earned or loss suffered and the financial position, it is necessary that all transactions be recorded in a systematic manner, which can be done only by an accountant. Proper maintenance of books of accounts assists management in planning, decision-making, controlling functions.\\nStatutory Audit: Every limited company is required to appoint a chartered accountant or a firm of chartered accountants as their auditor who are statutorily required to report each year whether in their opinion the balance sheet shows a true and fair view of the state of affairs on the balance sheet date, and the profit and loss account shows a true and fair view of the profit or loss for the year.\\nAuditing is not confined to the accounts of companies; other organisations may also have their accounts audited, either because the law so requires (for example, the Co-operative Societies Act, the Income-tax Act, etc.) or because the proprietors wisely decided so (for example, a partnership firm or an individual trader).\\nInternal Audit: It is a management tool whereby an internal auditor thoroughly examines the accounting transactions and also the system, according to which these have been recorded with a view to ensure the management that the accounts are being properly maintained and the system contains adequate safeguards to check any leakage of revenue or misappropriation of property or assets and the operations have been carried out in conformity with the plans of management.\\nNow-a-days internal auditing has developed as a service to management. The internal auditor constructively contributes in improving the operational efficiency of the business through an independent review and appraisal of all business operations.\\nTaxation: An accountant can handle taxation matters of a business or a person and he can represent that business or person before the tax authorities and settle the tax liability\\nunder the statute prevailing. He can also assist in avoiding or reducing tax burden by proper planning of tax affairs.\\nAccountants also have a social obligation to express their views on broad tax policy, on the effect of tax rate on business and the economy in general and on all other aspects of taxation in which they have knowledge superior to that of the general public.\\nManagement Accounting and Consultancy Services: Management accountant performs an advisory function. He is largely responsible for internal reporting to the management for planning and controlling current operations, decision-making on special matters and for formulating long-range plans. His job is to collect, analyse, interpret and present all accounting information which is useful to the management. Accountant provides management consultancy services in the areas of management information system, expenditure control and evaluation of appraisal techniques for new investments and divestments, working capital management, corporate planning etc.\\nFinancial Advice: Many people need help and guidance in planning their personal financial affairs. An accountant who knows about finances, taxation and family problems is well placed to give such advice. Some of the areas in which an accountant can render financial advice are:\\nInvestments: An accountant can explain the significance of the formidable documents which shareholders receive from companies and help in making decisions relating to their investments.\\nInsurance: An accountant can provide information to his clients on various insurance policies and helps in choosing appropriate policy.\\nBusiness Expansion: As businesses grow in size and complexity and mergers are being considered, accountants are in the forefront in interpreting accounts, making suggestions as to the form of schemes and the fairness of proposals considering cost and financial consequences and generally advising their clients. They also advise on how to set about the problem of borrowing money or whether this is an appropriate method of finance. Accountants can render extremely useful service in connection of negotiations with foreign collaborators.\\nInvestigations: Financial investigations are required for a variety of purposes. Examples are:\\nTo ascertain the financial position of a business, for the information of interested parties in connection with an issue of capital, the purchase or sale of the business or a reconstruction or amalgamation.\\nTo help the management to decide whether it is cheaper to manufacture an article or to buy out.\\nTo ascertain why profits have fallen.\\nTo achieve greater efficiency in management.\\nTo ascertain whether fraud has occurred and if so, its nature and extent and to make suggestions which will help to prevent a recurrence.\\nTo value businesses and shares in private companies for purposes such as purchase, sale, estate duty or wealth tax etc.\\nFor such problems requiring financial investigation, you need an accountant. His task as an independent professional is to establish the facts fairly and clearly for the benefit of those who have to make decisions and to give advice in many areas in which he has competence and experience.\\nPension schemes: Specialist advice from actuaries, insurance agents or insurance company is needed before launching or amending a provident fund or pension scheme in a business. But before making a final decision, an accountant has to be consulted. Later on, his help may be needed for managing the scheme or obtaining tax relief.\\nOther Services\\nSecretarial Work: Companies, clubs, and associations indeed, virtually all organisations involve secretarial work. Accountants frequently do this work.\\nShare Registration Work: Accountants are often used by many companies to undertake the work involved in registering share transfers and new issues.\\nCompany Formation: In conjunction with legal advisers, accountants help in the formation of a company or advise against doing so.\\nReceiverships, Liquidations, etc.: An accountant has to sometimes take on the onerous duties of liquidator when a company is being wound up or receiver when a debenture holder exercises a right to recover a loan on which the borrower has defaulted. Accountant is just the man for the job. He is also just the man to help you to keep insolvency away if you consult him in time.\\nArbitrations: At times, accountants are invited by parties to act as arbitrators in a dispute or settle disputes of various kinds.\\nAs regards the Cost Accounts: A cost accountant's job is to continuously report cost data and related information at frequent intervals to the management.\\n(g) Accountant and Information Services: An accountant will be effective in his role if he supplies the information promptly and in an unambiguous language. He should develop a system by which there is a regular flow of information both horizontally and vertically.\\nThe information system should be such that comparability of financial statement is possible both business-wise and year-wise so that it benefits both the management and the investors. Dependence on data from the computerised information system will put new responsibilities on an accountant but his product will command greater attention and respect.\", \"Chartered Accountant in Industry\\nAn accountant, though he is a part of the highest planning team is not a planner in an industry. He works with the functional departments and translates the organisation's aims in terms of financial expectations. Therefore, he has to make a thorough study of the business and of individuals in the functional departments, whether they are engineers or salesmen. A qualified accountant will be able to play an important role in performing important functions of a business relating to accounting, costing and budgetary control, estimating and treasury.\", 'Chartered Accountant in Public Sector Enterprises\\nBoth in the developed and developing countries, public sector enterprises have become a special feature of the national economy. The system of financial and budgetary control and of accounting, auditing and reporting has, therefore, become a matter of interest and concern to the nation, and does not remain confined merely to a limited number of shareholders. The form of accounting followed by these corporations or companies is different from that of ordinary government accounting. It is the duty of the accountants to prepare the accounts and reports of these public corporations in such a way that they enable the general public to know how far the items appearing in the various types of records and financial statements justify their existence.', 'Chartered Accountant in Framing Fiscal Policies\\nAccountants have a positive role to play in the determination of proper fiscal policies and advancement of trade, commerce and industry. They should develop new techniques and prepare themselves for new fields of service towards their commitment to the concept of the public goods and services. A business enterprise can be successful in the commercial sense only if accounting and business knowledge are pooled together. It is a social obligation for both accountants in industry and in practice to disclose greater information regarding the corporate results. The state of affairs of the economy can be ascertained only when such consolidated corporate information is disclosed.', 'Chartered Accountant and Economic Growth\\nIn the present times accountants should conceive their duties as broadly as the conditions might require and do not restrict them to only literal compliance of the law. Their aim should be not to allow any individual to gain at the cost of the nation. Accountants have to accept a positive role and do their best to encourage efficiency in individual business units and encourage those social objectives which form the main foundation of a welfare state.']), ('CA-FO-P1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1-U2-Accounting Concepts, Principles and Conventions', ['ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES AND CONVENTIONS\\nTop of Form\\nFundamental Accounting Concepts and Conventions\\nAccounting is governed by a set of underlying principles and conventions that ensure uniformity, reliability, and comparability of financial statements. These include:\\nEntity Concept: This principle dictates that the business is treated as a separate entity from its owners or other businesses, with its own set of financial records.\\nMoney Measurement Concept: According to this convention, only transactions that can be measured in monetary terms are recorded in the accounting books.\\nPeriodicity Concept: This concept facilitates the division of the continuous life of an enterprise into periodic intervals, usually a year, to produce financial reports.\\nAccrual Concept: This principle states that income and expenses are recognized when they are earned or incurred, not necessarily when the cash is received or paid.\\nMatching Concept: This concept advises that expenses should be matched with revenues in the period in which the revenue was earned, leading to an accurate calculation of profit or loss.\\nGoing Concern Concept: When preparing financial statements, it is assumed that the business will continue to operate and will not be forced to halt operations or liquidate assets.\\nCost Concept: This convention maintains that all assets are recorded in the books of accounts at their purchase price, which includes cost of acquisition, transportation, and installation and not their market price.\\nRealisation Concept: Revenue is recognized at the point when it is earned and is measurable, regardless of when cash is received.\\nDual Aspect Concept: This fundamental principle of accounting states that every transaction has a dual effect on the financial position of the business, represented by the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity.\\nConservatism: This convention suggests a degree of caution in the face of uncertainty, typically by recognizing expenses and liabilities as soon as possible when there is uncertainty about the outcome, but only recognizing revenues and assets when they are assured of being received.\\nConsistency: This principle states that once an accounting method has been chosen, it should be used consistently from one period to another to ensure comparability of financial statements over time.\\nMateriality: This concept implies that all significant items, the knowledge of which might influence the decision of a user of the financial statements, should be properly reported.\\nThese concepts and conventions form the bedrock of financial accounting, ensuring that the financial statements present a true and fair view of the financial performance and position of the business.', \"INTRODUCTION\\nLet us imagine a situation where you are a proprietor and you take copies of your books of account to five different accountants. You ask them to prepare the financial statements on the basis of the above records and to calculate the profits of the business for the year. After few days, they are ready with the financial statements and all the five accountants have calculated five different amounts of profits and that too with very wide variations among them. Guess in such a situation what impact would it leave on you about accounting profession. To avoid this, a generally accepted set of rules have been developed. This generally accepted set of rules provides unity of understanding and unity of approach in the practice of accounting and also in better preparation and presentation of the financial statements.\\nAccounting is a language of the business. Financial statements prepared by the accountant communicate financial information to the various stakeholders for decision-making purpose. Therefore, it is important that financial statements prepared by different organizations should\\nbe prepared on uniform basis. Also, there should be consistency over a period of time in the preparation of these financial statements. If every accountant starts following his own norms and notions for accounting of different items, then there will be an utter confusion.\\nTo avoid confusion and to achieve uniformity, accounting process is applied within the conceptual framework of 'Generally Accepted Accounting Principles'(GAAPs). The term GAAPs is used to describe rules developed for the preparation of the financial statements and are called concepts, conventions, postulates, principles etc. These GAAPs are the backbone of the accounting information system, without which the whole system cannot even stand erectly. These principles are the ground rules, which define the parameters and constraints within which accounting reports are generated. Accounting principles are basic norms and assumptions on which the whole accounting system has been developed and established. Accountant also adheres to various accounting standards issued by the regulatory authority for the standardization of accounting policies to be followed under specific circumstances. These conceptual frameworks, GAAPs and accounting standards are considered as the theory base of accounting. Globally, for achieving the standardization, countries use the framework under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, countries may apply their respective GAAPs and related conceptual frameworks. For example, in India, companies are required to use AS or Ind-AS frameworks as applicable.\", 'ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS\\nAccounting concepts define the assumptions on the basis of which financial statements of a business entity are prepared. Certain concepts are perceived, assumed and accepted in accounting to provide a unifying structure and internal logic to accounting process. The word concept means idea or notion, which has universal application. Financial transactions are interpreted in the light of the concepts, which govern accounting methods. Concepts are those basic assumptions and conditions, which form the basis upon which the accountancy has been laid. Unlike physical science, accounting concepts are only result of broad consensus. These accounting concepts lay the foundation on the basis of which the accounting principles are formulated.', 'ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\\t\\n\"Accounting principles are a body of doctrines commonly associated with the theory and procedures of accounting serving as an explanation of current practices and as a guide for selection of conventions or procedures where alternatives exist.\"\\nAccounting principles must satisfy the following conditions:\\nThey should be based on real assumptions;\\nThey must be simple, understandable and explanatory;\\nThey must be followed consistently;\\nThey should be able to reflect future predictions;\\nThey should be informational for the users.', \"ACCOUNTING CONVENTIONS\\nAccounting conventions emerge out of accounting practices, commonly known as accounting principles, adopted by various organizations over a period of time. These conventions are derived by usage and practice. The accountancy bodies of the world may change any of the convention to improve the quality of accounting information. Accounting conventions need not have universal application.\\nIn the study material, the terms 'accounting concepts', 'accounting principles' and 'accounting conventions' have been used interchangeably to mean those basic points of agreement on which financial accounting theory and practice are founded.\", \"CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES AND CONVENTIONS - AN OVERVIEW\\nNow we shall study in detail the various accounting concepts on which accounting is based. The following are the widely accepted accounting concepts:\\nConcepts, Principles Entity concept: \\nEntity concept states that business enterprise is a separate identity apart from its owner. Accountants should treat a business as distinct from its owner. Business transactions are recorded in the business books of accounts and owner's transactions in his personal books of accounts. The practice of distinguishing the affairs of the business from the personal affairs of the owners originated only in the early days of the doubleentry book-keeping. This concept helps in keeping business affairs free from the influence of the personal affairs of the owner. This basic concept is applied to all the organizations whether sole proprietorship or partnership or corporate entities.\\nEntity concept keeps the business separate from its owner. In a way, the entity concept helps to ascertain how much amount of money is due to the owner in form of his capital and share of profits earned. It also helps to perform accounting from the point of view of the business and not that of the owner. For example, if a person runs a business and pays money from his own pocket for his son's school fee, it will not constitute a transaction in the books of the business. However, if the person withdraws\\nmoney from the business to pay for his son's school fee it will constitute a transaction to be recorded in the books of the business as amount withdrawn by the owner.\\nEntity concept means that the enterprise is liable to the owner for capital investment made by the owner. Since the owner invested capital, which is also called risk capital, he has claim on the profit of the enterprise. A portion of profit which is apportioned to the owner and is immediately payable becomes current liability in the case of corporate entities.\", 'Concepts, Principles Money measurement concept: \\nAs per this concept, only those transactions, which can be measuredin terms of money are recorded. Since money is the medium of exchange and the standard of economic value, this concept requires that those transactions alone that are capable of being measured in terms of money be only to be recorded in the books of accounts. Transactions, even if, they affect the results of the business materially, are not recorded if they are not convertible in monetary terms.\\nFor example, a business owning a factory on a piece of 1 acre of land, with an office building with 2 floors, having 20 computers, and 10 units of machine cannot show these items under different measurement units. These items need to be expressed in monetary terms. The factory price might be , cost of land might be , building\\nwith a cost of , computers at a cost of 10 lac and machines with a cost of  need to be recorded.\\nHowever, the concept has its own limitations. Transactions and events that cannot be expressed in terms of money are not recorded in the business books. For example; employees of the organization are, no doubt, the assets of the organizations but their measurement in monetary terms is not possible therefore, not included in the books of account of the organization. Measuring unit for money is taken as the currency of the ruling country i.e., the ruling currency of a country provides a common denomination for the value of material objects.\\nIt may be mentioned that when transactions occur across the boundary of a country, one may see many currencies. Suppose a businessman sells goods worth ₹ 50 lakhs at home and he also sells goods worth of 1 lakh Euro in the United States. What is his total sales? ₹ 50 lakhs plus 1 lakh Euro.\\nThese are not amenable to even arithmetic treatment. So, transactions are to be recorded at uniform monetary unit i.e. in one currency. Suppose EURO 1 = ₹ 71 .\\nTotal Sales  lakhs plus 71 lakhs  lakhs. Money Measurement Concept imparts the essential flexibility for measurement and interpretation of accounting data.\\nThis concept ignores that money is an inelastic yardstick for measurement as it is based on the implicit assumption that purchasing power of the money is not of sufficient importance as to require adjustment. For example, a unit of land purchased 10 years ago for  and a similar unit of land purchased now for  will still be shown at the respective values, i.e., total of . Though in real world, the true value of the units together might be . Accordingly, accounting does not give a true and fair view of the affairs of the business.\\nAs mentioned earlier, many material transactions and events are not recorded in the books of accounts just because they cannot be measured in monetary terms. Yet it is used for accounting purposes because it is not possible to adopt a better measurement scale.\\nEntity and money measurement are viewed as the basic concepts on which other procedural concepts hinge.', \"Concepts, Principles Periodicity concept: \\nThis is also called the concept of definite accounting period. As per going concern' concept an indefinite life of the entity is assumed. For a business entity it causes inconvenience to measure performance achieved by the entity in the ordinary course of business.\\nIf a textile mill lasts for 100 years, it is not desirable to measure its performance as well as financial position only at the end of its life.\\nSo, a small but workable fraction of time is chosen out of infinite life cycle of the business entity for measuring performance and looking at the financial position. Generally, one year period is taken up for performance measurement and appraisal of financial position. However, it may also be 6 months or 9 months or 15 months.\\nAccording to this concept accounts should be prepared after every period & not at the end of the life of the entity. Usually, this period is one calendar year. We generally follow from 1st April of a year to 31st March of the immediately following year.\\nThus, for performance appraisal it is not necessary to look into the revenue and expenses of an unduly long time-frame. This concept makes the accounting system workable and the term 'accrual' meaningful. If one thinks of indefinite time-frame, nothing will accrue. There cannot be unpaid expenses and non- receipt of revenue. Accrued expenses or accrued revenue is only with reference to a finite time-frame which is called accounting period.\\nThus, the periodicity concept facilitates in:\\nComparing of financial statements of different periods\\nUniform and consistent accounting treatment for ascertaining the profit and assets of the business\\nMatching periodic revenues with expenses for getting correct results of the business operations\\nConcepts, Principles Accrual concept: \\nUnder accrual concept, the effects of transactions and other events are recognised on mercantile basis i.e., when they occur (and not as cash or a cash equivalent is received or paid) and they are recorded in the accounting records and reported in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. Financial statements prepared on the accrual basis inform users not only of past events involving the payment and receipt of cash but also of obligations to pay cash in the future and of resources that represent cash to be received in the future.\\nTo understand accrual assumption knowledge of revenues and expenses is required. Revenue is the gross inflow of cash, receivables and other consideration arising in the course of the ordinary activities of an enterprise from sale of goods, from rendering services and from the use by others of enterprise's resources yielding interest, royalties and dividends. For example, (1) Mr. X started a cloth merchandising. He invested , bought merchandise worth ₹ 50,000 . He sold such merchandise for ₹ 60,000 . Customers paid him ₹ 50,000 cash and assure him to pay ₹ 10,000 shortly. His revenue\\nis ₹ 60,000 . It arose in the ordinary course of cloth business; Mr. X received ₹ 50,000 in cash and  by way of receivables.\\nTake another example; (2) an electricity supply undertaking supplies electricity spending ₹  for fuel and wages and collects electricity bill in one month  by way of electricity charges. This is also revenue which arose from rendering services.\\nLastly, (3) Mr. A invested ₹  in a business. He purchased a machine paying ₹ . He rented it for ₹ 20,000 annually to Mr. B. ₹ 20,000 is the revenue of Mr. A; it arose from the use PG the enterprise's resources.\\nExpense is a cost relating to the operations of an accounting period or to the revenue earned during the period or the benefits of which do not extend beyond that period.\\nIn the first example, Mr. X spent ₹ 50,000 to buy the merchandise; it is the expense of generating revenue of . In the second instance  are the expenses. Also whenever any asset is used it has a finite life to generate benefit. Suppose, the machine purchased by Mr. A in the third example will last for 10 years only. Then  is the expense every year relating to the cost of machinery.\\nAccrual means recognition of revenue and costs as they are earned or incurred and not as money is received or paid. The accrual concept relates to measurement of income, identifying assets and liabilities.\\nExample: Mr. J D buys clothing of ₹ 50,000 paying cash  and sells at  of which customers paid only ₹ 50,000.\\nHis revenue is ₹ 60,000 , not  cash received. Expense (i.e., cost incurred for the revenue) is ₹ 50,000 , not ₹ 20,000 cash paid. So the accrual concept based profit is ₹ 10,000 (Revenue - Expenses).\\nAs per Accrual Concept: Revenue - Expenses  Profit\\nAccrual Concept provides the foundation on which the structure of present-day accounting has been developed.\\nAlternative as per Cash basis\\nCash received in ordinary course of business - Cash paid in ordinary course of business  profit.\\nTiming of revenue and expense booking could be different from cash receipt or paid.\\nwhen cash received before revenue - a liability is created when cash is is booked received in advance\\nwhen cash received after revenue is booked\\nwhen cash paid before expense is booked\\nwhen cash paid after expense is booked an asset called Trade receivables is created\\ncreates an asset called Trade Advance when cash is paid in advance\\ncreates a liability called payables or Trade payables or outstanding liabilities\\nConcepts, Principles Matching concept: \\nIn this concept, all expenses matched with the revenue of that period should only be taken into consideration. In the financial statements of the organization if any revenue is recognized then expenses related to earn that revenue should also be recognized.\\nThis concept is based on accrual concept as it considers the occurrence of expenses and income and do not concentrate on actual inflow or outflow of cash. This leads to adjustment of certain items like prepaid and outstanding expenses, unearned or accrued incomes.\\nIt is not necessary that every expense identify every income. Some expenses are directly related to the revenue and some are time bound. For example:- selling expenses are directly related to sales but rent, salaries etc are recorded on accrual basis for a particular accounting period. In other words periodicity concept has also been followed while applying matching concept.\\nMr. P K started cloth business. He purchased 10,000 pcs. garments @ ₹ 100 per piece and sold 8,000 pcs. @ ₹ 150 per piece during the accounting period of 12 months 1st January to  December, 2022. He paid shop rent @ ₹ 3,000 per month for 11 months and paid  to the suppliers of garments and received ₹  from the customers.\\nLet us see how the accrual and periodicity concepts operate.\\nPeriodicity Concept fixes up the time-frame for which the performance is to be measured and financial position is to be appraised. Here, it is January 2022 - December, 2022. Therefore, revenues and expenses are to be measured for the year 2022 and assets and liabilities are to be ascertained as on  December, 2022.\\nAccrual Concept operates to measure revenue of ₹ 12,00,000 (arising out of sale of garments 8,000 Pcs  ₹ 150) which accrued during 2022, not the cash received  and also the expenses correctly. Shop rent for 12 months is an expense item amounting to ₹ 36,000 , not ₹ 33,000 the cash paid.\\nShould the accountant treat  as expenses for purchase of merchandise? And should he treat ₹ 1,64,000 as profit? (Revenue ₹ 12,00,000-Merchandise ₹ 10,00,000. Shop Rent ₹ 36,000). Obviously, the answer is No. Matching links revenue with expenses.\\nRevenue - Expenses  Profit\\nBut this unqualified equation may create misconception.\\nIt should be defined as: Periodic Profit  Periodic Revenue - Matched Expenses\\nFrom the revenue of an accounting period such expenses are deducted which are expended to generate the revenue to determine profit of that period.\\nIn the given example revenue relates to only sale of 8,000 pcs. of garments. Therefore, the cost of 8,000 pcs of garments should be treated as expenses.\\nThus, Profit = Revenue\\nRevenue: ₹12,00,000\\nLess Expenses:\\nMerchandise: ₹8,00,000\\nShop Rent: ₹36,000\\nTotal Expenses: (₹8,36,000)\\nProfit:\\nNet Profit: ₹3,64,000\\nAssets:\\nInventory: (2,000 pcs x ₹100) = ₹2,00,000\\nTrade Receivables: ₹2,00,000\\nCash: (Cash Receipts ₹10,00,000 - Cash Payments ₹8,33,000) = ₹1,67,000\\nTotal Assets: ₹5,67,000\\nLiabilities:\\nTrade Payables: ₹2,00,000\\nExpenses Payables: ₹3,000\\nCapital (Profit): ₹3,64,000\\nTotal Liabilities: ₹5,67,000\\nThus, accrual, matching and periodicity concepts work together for income measurement and recognition of assets and liabilities.\", 'Concepts, Principles Going Concern concept: \\nThe financial statements are normally prepared on the assumption that an enterprise is a going concern and will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Hence, it is assumed that the enterprise has neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or curtail materially the scale of its operations; if such an\\nintention or need exists, the financial statements may have to be prepared on a different basis and, if so, the basis used needs to be disclosed.\\nThe valuation of assets of a business entity is dependent on this assumption. Traditionally, accountants follow historical cost in majority of the cases.\\nSuppose Mr. X purchased a machine for his business paying  out of  invested by him. He also paid transportation expenses and installation charges amounting to . If he is still willing to continue the business, his financial position will be as follows:\\nBALANCE SHEET\\nThis balance sheet shows that the entity has a total of ₹7,00,000 in capital, which matches the total value of assets. The assets are composed of machinery worth ₹5,70,000 and cash amounting to ₹1,30,000. The total liabilities equal the total assets, ensuring that the balance sheet is balanced.\\nNow if he decides to back out and desires to sell the machine, it may fetch more than or less than . So his financial position should be different. If going concern concept is taken, increase/ decrease in the value of assets in the short-run is ignored. The concept indicates that assets are kept for generating benefit in future, not for immediate sale; current change in the asset value is not realisable and so it should not be counted.\\nThis can be understood differently with some examples we may have come across in real life. Recently during pandemic, many businesses were shutting down due to heavy losses. If the financial statement of these entities does not reveal the fact of winding up due to losses, it will mislead the stakeholders. And, a sudden news of the business shutting down would be a setback to those stakeholders.\\nTherefore, entities need to assess at the time of preparation of financial statements, whether they are likely to continue to operate their business. If the Going Concern assumption is under question, the same information should be communicated to the stakeholders.', 'Concepts, Principles Cost concept: \\nBy this concept, the value of an asset is to be determined on the basis of historical cost, in other words, acquisition cost. Although there are various measurement bases, accountants traditionally prefer this concept in the interests of objectivity. When a machine is acquired by paying ₹ , following cost concept the value of the machine is taken as ₹ 5,00,000. It is highly objective and free from all bias. Other measurement bases are not so objective. Current cost of an asset is not easily determinable. If the asset is purchased on 1.1.1995 and such model is not available in\\nthe market, it becomes difficult to determine which model is the appropriate equivalent to the existing one. Similarly, unless the machine is actually sold, realisable value will give only a hypothetical figure. Lastly, present value base is highly subjective because to know the value of the asset one has to chase the uncertain future.\\nHowever, the cost concept creates a lot of distortion too as outlined below:\\nIn an inflationary situation when prices of all commodities go up on an average, acquisition cost loses its relevance. For example, a piece of land purchased on 1.1.1995 for ₹ 2,000 may cost ₹  as on 1.1.2022. So if the accountant makes valuation of asset at historical cost, the accounts will not reflect the true position.\\nHistorical cost-based accounts may lose comparability. Mr. X invested ₹ 1,00,000 in a machine on 1.1.1995 which produces ₹ 50,000 cash inflow during the year 2022, while Mr. Y invested ₹ 5,00,000 in a machine on 1.1.2005 which produced  cash inflows during the year. Mr. X earned at the rate  while Mr. Y earned at the rate . Who is more efficient? Since the assets are recorded at the historical cost, the results are not comparable. Obviously, it is a corollary to (a).\\nMany assets do not have acquisition costs. Human assets of an enterprise are an example. The cost concept fails to recognise such asset although it is a very important asset of any organization.\\nMany other controversial issues have arisen in financial accounting that revolves around the cost concept which will be discussed at the advanced stage. However, later on we shall see that in many circumstances, the cost convention is not followed. See conservatism concept for an example, which will be discussed later on in this unit.', 'Concepts, Principles Realization concept: \\nIt closely follows the cost concept. Any change in value of an asset is to be recorded only when the business realises it. When an asset is recorded at its historical cost of  and even if its current cost is  such change is not counted unless there is certainty that such change will materialize.\\nHowever, accountants follow a more conservative path. They try to cover all probable losses but do not count any probable gain. That is to say, if accountants anticipate decrease in value they count it, but if there is increase in value they ignore it until it is realized. Economists are highly critical about the realisation concept. According to them, this concept creates value distortion and makes accounting meaningless.\\nThus, the going concern, cost concept and realization concept gives the valuation criteria.\\nDual aspect concept: This concept is the core of double entry book-keeping. Every transaction or event has two aspects:\\nIt increases one Asset and decreases other Asset;\\nIt increases an Asset and simultaneously increases Liability;\\nIt decreases one Asset, increases another Asset;\\nIt decreases one Asset, decreases a Liability.\\nAlternatively:\\nIt increases one Liability, decreases other Liability;\\nIt increases a Liability, increases an Asset;\\nIt decreases Liability, increases other Liability;\\nIt decreases Liability, decreases an Asset.', \"Concepts, Principles Conservatism: \\nConservatism states that the accountant should not anticipate any future income however they should provide for all possible losses. When there are many alternative values of an asset, an accountant should choose the method which leads to the lesser value. Later on, we shall see that the golden rule of current assets valuation - 'cost or market price whichever is lower' originated from this concept.\\nThe Realisation Concept also states that no change should be counted unless it has materialised. The Conservatism Concept puts a further brake on it. It is not prudent to count unrealised gain but it is desirable to guard against all possible losses.\\nFor this concept there should be at least three qualitative characteristics of financial statements, namely,\\nPrudence, i.e., judgement about the possible future losses which are to be guarded, as well as gains which are uncertain.\\nNeutrality, i.e., unbiased outlook is required to identify and record such possible losses, as well as to exclude uncertain gains,\\nFaithful representation of alternative values.\\nThis concept is of wider importance to investors since they would need to take a decision about their money being invested in the business. Recording future profits when these have not been earned would suggest that the business is booming, and the investors would be tempted to put more money into the same. However, eventually if the profit is not earned, the investors are likely to loose their investments. At the same time, if the entity expects to make a loss in future, it is prudent to show that loss in the books in present itself. This acts as a safeguard for the investors as they would be prudent to make the investment decisions. For example: Mr.  runs a business of computers. He purchased 10 computers at a cost of  each and is expecting to be able to sell these computers at the current market price of ₹ 25,000 each. Note that the conservatism principle does not allow to recognise the profit on the computers unless the sale has been made. Since, this is a future profit, Mr. X needs to follow a prudent approach while recording the transactions in his books and ignore the profit until it is earned\\nHowever, before sale, the market price of the computers declines to ₹ 17,000 each. Under the conservatism approach, Mr. X needs to recognise that loss of  per computer, even though the sale has not been made.\\nMany accounting authors, however, are of the view that conservatism essentially leads to understatement of income and wealth and it should not be the basis for the preparation of financial statements.\", \"Concepts, Principles Consistency: \\nIn order to achieve comparability of the financial statements of an enterprise through time, the accounting policies are followed consistently from one period to another; a change in an accounting policy is made only in certain exceptional circumstances.\\nThe concept of consistency is applied particularly when alternative methods of accounting are equally acceptable. For example, a company may adopt any of several methods of depreciation such as written-down-value method, straight-line method, etc. Likewise, there are many methods for valuation of inventories. But following the principle of consistency it is advisable that the company should follow consistently\\nover years the same method of depreciation or the same method of valuation of Inventories which is chosen. However, in some cases though there is no inconsistency, they may seem to be inconsistent apparently. In case of valuation of Inventories if the company applies the principle 'at cost or market price whichever is lower' and if this principle accordingly results in the valuation of Inventories in one year at cost price and the market price in the other year, there is no inconsistency here. It is only an application of the principle.\\nBut the concept of consistency does not imply non-flexibility as not to allow the introduction of improved method of accounting.\\nAn enterprise should change its accounting policy in any of the following circumstances only:\\nTo bring the books of accounts in accordance with the issued Accounting Standards.\\nTo comply with the provision of law.\\nWhen under changed circumstances, it is felt that new method will reflect a true and fair picture in the financial statement.\", \"Concepts, Principles Materiality: \\nMateriality principle permits other concepts to be ignored, if the effect is not considered material. This principle is an exception to full disclosure principle. According to materiality principle, all the items having significant economic effect on the business of the enterprise should be disclosed in the financial statements and any insignificant item which will only increase the work of the accountant but will not be relevant to the users' need should not be disclosed in the financial statements.\\nThe term materiality is the subjective term. It is on the judgement, common sense and discretion of the accountant that which item is material and which is not. For example, stationary purchased by the organization though not used fully in the accounting year purchased still shown as an expense of that year because of the materiality concept. Similarly, depreciation on small items like books, calculators etc. is taken as  in the year of purchase though used by the entity for more than a year. This is because the amount for books or calculator is very small to be shown in the balance sheet though it is the asset of the company.\\nThe materiality depends not only upon the amount of the item but also upon the size of the business, nature and level of information, level of the person making the decision etc. Moreover, an item material to one person may be immaterial to another person. What is important is that omission of any information should not impair the decision-making of various users.\", 'FUNDAMENTAL ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS\\nThere are three fundamental accounting assumptions:\\nGoing Concern\\nConsistency\\nAccrual\\nAll the above three fundamental accounting assumptions have already been explained in para 2.5.\\nIf nothing has been written about the fundamental accounting assumption in the financial statements then it is assumed that they have already been followed in their preparation of financial statements. However, if any of the above-mentioned fundamental accounting assumption is not followed then this fact should be specifically disclosed.', \"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nThe aim of accounting is to keep systematic records to ascertain financial performance and financial position of an entity and to communicate the relevant financial information to the interested user groups. The financial statements are basic means through which the management of an entity makes public communication of the financial information along with selected quantitative details. They are structured financial representations of the financial position and the performance of an enterprise. To have a record of all business transactions and also to determine whether all these transactions resulted in either 'profit or loss' for the period, all the entities will prepare financial statements viz., balance sheet, profit and loss account, cash flow statement etc. by following various accounting concepts, principles, and conventions which have been already discussed in detail.\", 'Qualitative Characteristics of financial Statements\\nQualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information provided in financial statements useful to users. The following are the important qualitative characteristics of the financial statements:\\nUnderstandability: An essential quality of the information provided in financial statements is that it must be readily understandable by users. For this purpose, it is assumed that users have a reasonable knowledge of business, economic activities and accounting and study the information with reasonable diligence. Information about complex matters that should be included in the financial statements because of its relevance to the economic decision-making needs of users should not be excluded merely on the ground that it may be too difficult for certain users to understand.\\nRelevance: To be useful, information must be relevant to the decision-making needs of users. Information has the quality of relevance when it influences the economic decisions of users by helping them evaluate past, present or future events or confirming, or correcting, their past evaluations.\\nReliability: To be useful, information must also be reliable, Information has the quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be depended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.\\nComparability: Users must be able to compare the financial statements of an enterprise through time in order to identify trends in its financial position, performance and cash flows. Users must also be able to compare the financial statements of different enterprises in order to evaluate their relative financial position, performance and cash flows. Hence, the measurement and display of the financial effects of like transactions and other events must be carried out in a consistent way throughout an enterprise and over time for that enterprise and in a consistent way for different enterprises.\\nMateriality: The relevance of information is affected by its materiality. Information is material if its misstatement (i.e., omission or erroneous statement) could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial information. Materiality depends on the size and nature of the item or error, judged in the particular circumstances of its misstatement. Materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point rather than being a primary qualitative characteristic which the information must have if it is to be useful.\\nFaithful Representation: To be reliable, information must represent faithfully the transactions and other events it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. Thus, for example, a balance sheet should represent faithfully the transactions and other events that result in assets, liabilities and equity of the enterprise at the reporting date which meet the recognition criteria.\\nSubstance over Form: If information is to represent faithfully the transactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality and not merely their legal form. The substance of transactions or other events is not always consistent with that which is apparent from their legal or contrived form. For example, where rights and beneficial interest in an immovable property are transferred but the documentations and legal formalities are pending, the recording of acquisition/disposal (by the transferee and transferor respectively) would in substance represent the transaction entered into.\\nNeutrality: To be reliable, the information contained in financial statements must be neutral, that is, free from bias. Financial statements are not neutral if, by the selection or presentation of information, they influence the making of a decision or judgement in order to achieve a predetermined result or outcome.\\nPrudence: The preparers of financial statements have to contend with the uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the collectability of receivables, the probable useful life of plant and machinery, and the warranty claims that may occur. Such uncertainties are recognised by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by the exercise of prudence in the preparation of the financial statements. Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of the judgments needed in making the estimates required under conditions of uncertainty, such that assets or income are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not understated. However, the exercise of prudence does not allow, for example, the creation of hidden reserves or excessive provisions, the deliberate understatement of assets or income, or the deliberate overstatement of liabilities or expenses, because the financial statements would then not be neutral and, therefore, not have the quality of reliability.\\nFull, fair and adequate disclosure: The financial statement must disclose all the reliable and relevant information about the business enterprise to the management and also to their external users for which they are meant, which in turn will help them to take a reasonable and rational decision. For it, it is necessary that financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles i.e the information is accounted for and presented in accordance with its substance and economic reality and not merely with its legal form. The disclosure should be full and final so that users can correctly assess the financial position of the enterprise.\\nCompleteness: To be reliable, the information in financial statements must be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost. An omission can cause information to be false or misleading and thus unreliable and deficient in terms of its relevance.', 'Qualitative Characteristics of financial Statements\\nQualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information provided in financial statements useful to users. The following are the important qualitative characteristics of the financial statements:\\nFinancial Statements of Understandability: An essential quality of the information provided in financial statements is that it must be readily understandable by users. For this purpose, it is assumed that users have a reasonable knowledge of business, economic activities and accounting and study the information with reasonable diligence. Information about complex matters that should be included in the financial statements because of its relevance to the economic decision-making needs of users should not be excluded merely on the ground that it may be too difficult for certain users to understand.', 'Financial Statements of Relevance: To be useful, information must be relevant to the decision-making needs of users. Information has the quality of relevance when it influences the economic decisions of users by helping them evaluate past, present or future events or confirming, or correcting, their past evaluations.\\nThe predictive and confirmatory roles of information are interrelated. For example, information about the current level and structure of asset holdings has value to users when they endeavour to predict the ability of the enterprise to take advantage of opportunities and its ability to react to adverse situations. The same information plays a confirmatory role in respect of past predictions about, for example, the way in which the enterprise would be structured or the outcome of planned operations.\\nInformation about financial position and past performance is frequently used as the basis for predicting future financial position and performance and other matters in which users are directly interested, such as dividend and wage payments, share price movements and the ability of the enterprise to meet its commitments as they fall due. To have predictive value, information need not be in the form of an explicit forecast. The ability to make predictions from financial statements is enhanced, however, by the manner in which information on past transactions and events is displayed. For example, the predictive value of the statement of profit and loss is enhanced if unusual, abnormal and infrequent items of income and expense are separately disclosed.', 'Financial Statements of Reliability: To be useful, information must also be reliable, Information has the quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be depended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.\\nInformation may be relevant but so unreliable in nature or representation that its recognition may be potentially misleading. For example, if the validity and amount of a claim for damages under a legal action against the enterprise are highly uncertain, it may be inappropriate for the enterprise to recognise the amount of the claim in the balance sheet, although it may be appropriate to disclose the amount and circumstances of the claim.', 'Financial Statements of Comparability: Users must be able to compare the financial statements of an enterprise through time in order to identify trends in its financial position, performance and cash flows. Users must also be able to compare the financial statements of different enterprises in order to evaluate their relative financial position, performance and cash flows. Hence, the measurement and display of the financial effects of like transactions and other events must be carried out in a consistent way throughout an enterprise and over time for that enterprise and in a consistent way for different enterprises.\\nAn important implication of the qualitative characteristic of comparability is that users be informed of the accounting policies employed in the preparation of the financial statements, any changes in those polices and the effects of such changes. Users need to be able to identify differences between the accounting policies for like transactions and other events used by the same enterprise from period to period and by different enterprises. Compliance with Accounting Standards, including the disclosure of the accounting policies used by the enterprise, helps to achieve comparability.\\nThe need for comparability should not be confused with mere uniformity and should not be allowed to become an impediment to the introduction of improved accounting standards. It is not appropriate for an enterprise to continue accounting in the same manner for a transaction or other event if the policy adopted is not in keeping with the qualitative characteristics of relevance and reliability. It is also inappropriate for an enterprise to leave its accounting policies unchanged when more relevant and reliable alternatives exist.\\nUsers wish to compare the financial position, performance and cash flows of an enterprise over time. Hence, it is important that the financial statements show corresponding information for the preceding period(s).\\nThe four principal qualitative characteristics are understandability, relevance,reliability and comparability.', 'Financial Statements of Materiality: The relevance of information is affected by its materiality. Information is material if its misstatement (i.e., omission or erroneous statement) could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial information. Materiality depends on the size and nature of the item or error, judged in the particular circumstances of its misstatement. Materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point rather than being a primary qualitative characteristic which the information must have if it is to be useful.', 'Financial Statement of Faithful Representation: To be reliable, information must represent faithfully the transactions and other events it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. Thus, for example, a balance sheet should represent faithfully the transactions and other events that result in assets, liabilities and equity of the enterprise at the reporting date which meet the recognition criteria.\\nMost financial information is subject to some risk of being less than a faithful representation of that which it purports to portray. This is not due to bias, but rather to inherent difficulties either in identifying the transactions and other events to be measured or in devising and applying measurement and presentation techniques that can convey messages that correspond with those transactions and events. In certain\\ncases, the measurement of the financial effects of items could be so uncertain that enterprises generally would not recognise them in the financial statements; for example, although most enterprises generate goodwill internally over time, it is usually difficult to identify or measure that goodwill reliably. In other cases, however, it may be relevant to recognise items and to disclose the risk of error surrounding their recognition and measurement.', 'Financial Statements of Substance over Form: If information is to represent faithfully the transactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality and not merely their legal form. The substance of transactions or other events is not always consistent with that which is apparent from their legal or contrived form.

The disclosure should be full and final so that users can correctly assess the financial position of the enterprise.\\nThe principle of full disclosure implies that nothing should be omitted while principle of fair disclosure implies that all the transactions recorded should be accounted in a manner that financial statement purports true and fair view of the results of the business of the enterprise and adequate disclosure implies that the information influencing the decision of the users should be disclosed in detail and should make sense.\\nThis principle is widely used in corporate organizations because of separation in management and ownership. The Companies Act in pursuant of this principle came out with the format of balance sheet and profit and loss account. The disclosures of all the major accounting policies and other information are to be provided in the form of footnotes, annexures etc. The practice of appending notes to the financial statements is the outcome of this principle.', 'Financial Statements of Completeness: To be reliable, the information in financial statements must be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost. An omission can cause information to be false or misleading and thus unreliable and deficient in terms of its relevance.\\nThus, if accounting information is to present faithfully the transactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality, not by their legal form. For example, if a business enterprise sells its assets to others but still uses the assets as usual for the purpose of the business by making some arrangement with the seller, it simply becomes a legal transaction. The economic reality is that the business is using the assets as usual for deriving the benefit. Financial statement information should contain the substance of this transaction and should not only record going by legality. In order to be reliable, the financial statements information should be neutral i.e., free from bias. The prepares of financial statements however, have to contend with the uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the collectability of doubtful receivables, the probable useful life of plant and equipment and the number of warranty claims that many occur. Such uncertainties are recognised by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by exercise of prudence in the preparation of financial statements. Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of judgement needed in making the estimates required under condition of uncertainty such that assets and income are not overstated and loss and liability are not understated.']), ('CA-FO-P1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1-U7-Accounting Standards', [\"INTRODUCTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nAccounting as a 'language of business' communicates the financial results of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. If the financial accounting process is not properly regulated, there is possibility of financial statements being misleading, tendentious and providing a distorted picture of the business, rather than the true. To ensure transparency, consistency, comparability, adequacy and reliability of financial reporting, it is essential to standardize the accounting principles and policies. Accounting Standards (ASs) provide framework and standard accounting policies for treatment of transactions and events so that the financial statements of different enterprises become comparable.\\nAccounting standards are written policy documents issued by the expert accounting body or by the government or other regulatory body covering the aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of accounting transactions and events in the financial statements. The ostensible purpose of the standard setting bodies is to promote the dissemination of timely and useful financial information to investors and certain other parties having an interest in the company's economic performance. The accounting standards deal with the issues of -\\nrecognition of events and transactions in the financial statements;\\nmeasurement of these transactions and events;\\npresentation of these transactions and events in the financial statements in a manner that is meaningful and understandable to the reader; and\\nthe disclosure requirements which should be there to enable the public at large and the stakeholders and the potential investors in particular, to get an insight into what these financial statements are trying to reflect and thereby facilitating them to take prudent and informed business decisions.\", 'OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nThe whole idea of accounting standards is centered around harmonisation of accounting policies and practices followed by different business entities so that the diverse accounting practices adopted for various aspects of accounting can be standardised. Accounting Standards standardise diverse accounting policies with a view to:\\neliminate the non-comparability of financial statements and thereby improving the reliability of financial statements; and\\nprovide a set of standard accounting policies, valuation norms and disclosure requirements.\\nAccounting standards reduce the accounting alternatives in the preparation of financial statements within the bounds of rationality, thereby ensuring comparability of financial statements of different enterprises.', 'BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nAccounting standards seek to describe the accounting principles, the valuation techniques and the methods of applying the accounting principles in the preparation and presentation of financial statements so that they may give a true and fair view. By setting the accounting standards, the accountant has following benefits:\\nStandards reduce to a reasonable extent or eliminate altogether confusing variations in the accounting treatments used to prepare financial statements.\\nThere are certain areas where important information are not statutorily required to be disclosed. Standards may call for disclosure beyond that required by law.\\nThe application of accounting standards would, to a limited extent, facilitate comparison of financial statements of companies situated in different parts of the world and also of different companies situated in the same country. However, it should be noted in this respect that differences in the institutions, traditions and legal systems from one country to another give rise to differences in accounting standards adopted in different countries.\\nBenefits of Accounting Standards\\nAccounting standards provide several key advantages that are crucial for the uniformity and transparency of financial reporting:\\nStandardisation of Alternative Accounting Treatments: Accounting standards mitigate inconsistencies by standardizing various methods available for accounting treatments. This eliminates the discrepancies that can arise when different practices are applied to similar transactions.\\nRequirements for Additional Disclosures: They necessitate comprehensive disclosures that give users of financial statements a more complete understanding of the financial information presented. These disclosures are integral to ensuring that all relevant financial data is communicated effectively.\\nComparability of Financial Statements: One of the most significant benefits of accounting standards is the comparability they afford. By providing a consistent framework for financial reporting, these standards make it possible to compare financial statements across different periods and entities, enhancing the decision-making process for investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.\\nHowever, there are some limitations of accounting standards:\\nDifficulties in making choice between different treatments: Alternative solutions to certain accounting problems may each have arguments to recommend them. Therefore, the choice between different alternative accounting treatments may become difficult.\\nRestricted scope: Accounting standards cannot override the statute. The standards are required to be framed within the ambit of prevailing statutes.', 'PROCESS OF FORMULATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN INDIA\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), being a premier accounting body in the country, took upon itself the leadership role by constituting the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in 1977. The ICAI has taken significant initiatives in the setting and issuing procedure of Accounting Standards to ensure that the standard-setting process is fully consultative and transparent. The ASB considers International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) while framing Indian Accounting Standards (ASs) in India and try to integrate them, in the light of the applicable laws, customs, usages and business environment in the country. The composition of ASB includes, representatives of industries (namely, ASSOCHAM, CII, FICCI), regulators, academicians, government departments etc. Although ASB is a body constituted by the Council of the ICAI, it (ASB) is independent in the formulation of accounting standards and Council of the ICAI is not empowered to make any modifications in the draft accounting standards formulated by ASB without consulting with the ASB.\\nThe standard-setting procedure of Accounting Standards Board (ASB) can be briefly outlined as follows:\\nIdentification of broad areas by ASB for formulation of AS.\\nConstitution of study groups by ASB to consider specific projects and to prepare preliminary drafts of the proposed accounting standards. The draft normally includes objective and scope of the standard, definitions of the terms used in the standard, recognition and measurement principles wherever applicable and presentation and disclosure requirements.\\nConsideration of the preliminary draft prepared by the study group of ASB and revision, if any, of the draft on the basis of deliberations.\\nCirculation of draft of accounting standard (after revision by ASB) to the Council members of the ICAI and specified outside bodies such as Department of Company Affairs (DCA), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C&AG), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE), etc. for comments.\\nMeeting with the representatives of the specified outside bodies to ascertain their views on the draft of the proposed accounting standard.\\nFinalisation of the exposure draft of the proposed accounting standard and its issuance inviting public comments.\\nConsideration of comments received on the exposure draft and finalisation of the draft accounting standard by the ASB for submission to the Council of the ICAI for its consideration and approval for issuance.\\nConsideration of the final draft of the proposed standard and by the Council of the ICAI, and if found necessary, modification of the draft in consultation with the ASB is done.\\nThe accounting standard on the relevant subject (for non-corporate entities) is then issued by the ICAI. For corporate entities the accounting standards are issued by The Central Government of India.', \"LIST OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN INDIA\\nThe 'Accounting Standards' issued by the Accounting Standards Board establish standards which have to be complied by the business entities so that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\\nFollowing is the list of applicable Accounting Standards:\\nList of Accounting Standards\\nAS 1 detail the Disclosure of Accounting Policies.\\nAS 2 (Revised) pertains to the Valuation of Inventories.\\nAS 3 (Revised) is about Cash Flow Statements.\\nAS 4 (Revised) addresses Contingencies and Events Occurring after the Balance Sheet Date.\\nAS 5 (Revised) covers Net Profit or Loss for the Period, Prior Period Items, and Changes in Accounting Policies.\\nAS 7 (Revised) relates to Accounting for Construction Contracts.\\nAS 9 deals with Revenue Recognition.\\nAS 10 concerns Property, Plant and Equipment.\\nAS 11 (Revised) explains The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.\\nAS 12 involves Accounting for Government Grants.\\nAS 13 is related to Accounting for Investments.\\nAS 14 discusses Accounting for Amalgamations.\\nAS 15 (Revised) elaborates on Employee Benefits.\\nAS 16 is about Borrowing Costs.\\nAS 17 covers Segment Reporting.\\nAS 18 is concerned with Related Party Disclosures.\\nAS 19 pertains to Leases.\\nAS 20 deals with Earnings Per Share.\\nAS 21 involves Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAS 22 is related to Accounting for Taxes on Income.\\nAS 23 concerns Accounting for Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAS 24 addresses Discontinuing Operations.\\nAS 25 elaborates on Interim Financial Reporting.\\nAS 26 is about Intangible Assets.\\nAS 27 covers Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures.\\nAS 28 discusses Impairment of Assets.\\nAS 29 pertains to Provisions, Contingent Liabilities & Contingent Assets. \\u200b\\u200b\", 'Indian Accounting Standards (IND AS)\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) being the accounting standards-setting body in India, way back in 2006, initiated the process of moving towards the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) with a view to enhance acceptability and transparency of the financial information communicated by the Indian corporates through their financial statements. This move towards IFRS was subsequently accepted by the Government of India. The Government of India in consultation with the ICAI decided to converge and not to adopt IFRSs issued by the IASB. The decision of convergence rather than adoption was taken after the detailed analysis of IFRS requirements and extensive discussion with various stakeholders. Accordingly, while formulating IFRS- converged Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), efforts have been made to keep these Standards, as far as possible, in line with the corresponding IFRS and departures have been made where considered absolutely essential.

Policies are based on various accounting concepts, principles and conventions that have already been explained in Unit 2 of Chapter 1. There is no single list of accounting policies, which are applicable to all enterprises in all circumstances. Enterprises operate in diverse and complex environmental situations and so they have to adopt various policies. The choice of specific accounting policy appropriate to the specific circumstances in which the enterprise is operating, calls for considerate judgement by the management. ICAI has been trying to reduce the number of acceptable accounting policies through Guidance Notes and Accounting Standards in its combined efforts with the government, other regulatory agencies and progressive managements. Already it has achieved some progress in this respect.\\nThe areas wherein different accounting policies are frequently encountered can be given as follows:\\nValuation of Inventories;\\nValuation of Investments.\\nThis list should not be taken as exhaustive but is only illustrative. As the course will progress, students will see the intricacies of the various accounting policies.\\nSuppose an enterprise holds some investments in the form of shares of a company at the end of an accounting period. For valuation of shares, the enterprise may adopt FIFO, average method etc. The method selected by that enterprise for valuation is called an accounting policy.', 'SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nChoice of accounting policy is an important policy decision which affects the performance measurement as well as financial position of the business entity. Selection of inappropriate accounting policy may lead to understatement or overstatement of performance and financial position. Thus, accounting policy should be selected with due care after considering its effect on the financial performance of the business enterprise from the angle of various users of accounts.\\nIt is believed that no unified and exhaustive list of accounting policies can be suggested which has universal application. Three major characteristics which should be considered for the purpose of selection and application of accounting policies. viz., Prudence, Substance over form, and Materiality. The financial statements should be prepared on the basis of such accounting policies, which exhibit true and fair view of state of affairs of Balance Sheet and the Profit & Loss Account.\\nExamples wherein selection from a set of accounting policies is made, can be given as follows:-\\nInventories are valued at cost except for finished goods and by-products. Finished goods are valued at lower of cost or market value and by-products are valued at net realizable value.\\nInvestments (long term) are valued at their acquisition cost. Provision for permanent diminution in value has been made wherever necessary.\\nSometimes a wrong or inappropriate treatment is adopted for items in Balance Sheet, or Profit & Loss Account, or other statement. Disclosure of the treatment adopted is necessary in any case, but disclosure cannot rectify a wrong or inappropriate treatment.', 'CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nA change in accounting policies should be made in the following conditions:\\nIt is required by some statute or for compliance with an Accounting Standard\\nChange would result in more appropriate presentation of financial statement\\nChange in accounting policy may have a material effect on the items of financial statements. For example, if cost formula used for inventory valuation is changed from weighted average to FIFO, or if interest is capitalized which was earlier not in practice, or if proportionate amount of interest is changed to inventory which was earlier not the practice, all these may increase or decrease the net profit. Unless the effect of such change in accounting policy is quantified, the financial statements may not help the users of accounts. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the effect of change on financial statement items like assets, liabilities, profit/loss.\\nFor example, Omega Enterprises revised its accounting policy relating to valuation of inventories to include applicable production overheads. It intends to do as it believes that such change would result in a more appropriate presentation of its financial statements.'])]\n"

Primarily transactions and events are measured in terms of money. Any measurement discipline deals with three basic elements of measurement viz., identification of objects and events to be measured, selection of standard or scale to be used, and evaluation of dimension of measurement standards or scale.\\nProf. R. J. Chambers defined \\'measurement\\' as \"assignment of numbers to objects and events according to rules specifying the property to be measured, the scale to be used and the dimension of the unit\". (R.J. Chambers, Accounting Evaluation and Economic Behaviour, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 1966, P.10).\\nKohler defined measurement as the assignment of a system of ordinal or cardinal numbers to the results of a scheme of inquiry or apparatus of observations in accordance with logical or mathematical rules - [A Dictionary of Accountant].\\nOrdinal numbers, or ordinals, are numbers used to denote the position in an ordered sequence: first, second, third, fourth, etc., whereas a cardinal number says \\'how many there are\\': one, two, three, four, etc.\\nChambers\\' definition has been widely used to judge how far accounting can be treated as a measurement discipline.\\nAccording to this definition, the three elements of measurement are:\\nIdentification of objects and events to be measured;\\nSelection of standard or scale to be used;\\nEvaluation of dimension of measurement standard or scale.', \"OBJECTS OR EVENTS TO BE MEASURED\\nWe have earlier defined Accounting as the process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decisions by the users of the information. So accounting essentially includes measurement of 'information'.\\nDecision makers need past, present and future information. For external users, generally the past information is communicated.\\nThere is no uniform set of events and transactions in accounting which are required for decision making. For example, in cash management, various cash receipts and expenses are the necessary objects and events. Obviously, the decision makers need past cash receipts and expenses data along with projected receipts and expenses. For giving loan to a business one needs information regarding the repayment ability (popularly called debt servicing) of principal and interest. This also includes past information, current state of affairs as well as future projections. It may be mentioned that past and present objects and events can be measured with some degree of accuracy but future events and objects are only predicted, not measured. Prediction is an essential part of accounting information. Decision makers have to take decisions about the unseen future for which they need suitable information.\", 'STANDARD OR SCALE OF MEASUREMENT\\nIn accounting, money is the scale of measurement (see money measurement concept), although now-a- days quantitative information is also communicated along with monetary information.\\nMoney as a measurement scale has no universal denomination. It takes the shape of currency ruling in a country. For example, in India the scale of measurement is Rupee, in the U.K. Pound Sterling (  ), in Germany Deutschmark (DM), in the United States Dollar ($) and so on. Also there is no constant exchange relationship among the currencies.\\nIf one businessman in India took loan  from a businessman of the U.S.A., he would enter the transaction in his books in terms of ₹ Suppose at the time of loan agreement exchange rate was US . Then loan amounted to ₹ . Afterwards the exchange rate has been changed to . At the changed exchange rate the loan amount becomes₹ . So money as a unit of measurement lacks universal applicability across the boundary of a country unless a common currency is in vogue. Since the rate of exchange fluctuates between two currencies over the time, money as a measurement scale also becomes volatile.', 'DIMENSION OF MEASUREMENT SCALE\\nAn ideal measurement scale should be stable over time. For example, if one buys . cabbage today, the quantity he receives will be the same if he will buy . cabbage one year later. Similarly, length of 1 metre cloth will not change if it is bought a few days later. That is to say a measurement scale should be stable in dimension. Money as a scale of measurement is not stable. There occurs continuous change in the input output prices. The same quantity of money may not have the ability to buy same quantity of identical goods at different dates. Thus information of one year measured in money terms may not be comparable with that of another year. Suppose production and sales of a company in two different years are as follows:\\nIn Year 1, 5,000 pieces were valued at ₹5,00,000, while in Year 2, 4,500 pieces were valued at ₹5,40,000\\nLooking at the monetary figures one may be glad for  sales growth. In fact there was  production and sales decline. The growth envisaged through monetary figures is only due to price change. Let us suppose further that the cost of production for the above mentioned two years is as follows:\\nIn Year 1, the quantity was 5,000 pieces valued at ₹4,00,000; in Year 2, it was 4,500 pieces valued at ₹4,50,000.\\nTake Gross profit  Sales - Cost of Production. Then in the first year profit was ₹ 1,00,000 while in the second year the profit was ₹ 90,000 . There was  decline in gross profit.\\nSo, money as a unit of measurement is not stable in the dimension.\\nThus, Accounting measures information mostly in money terms which is not a stable scale having universal applicability and also not stable in dimension for comparison over the time. So it is not an exact measurement discipline.', \"ACCOUNTING AS A MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE\\nHow do you measure a transaction or an event? Unless the measurement base is settled we cannot progress to the record keeping function of book-keeping. It has been explained that accounting is meant for generating information suitable for users' judgments and decisions. But generation of such information is preceded by recording, classifying and summarising data. By that process it measures performance of the business entity by way of profit or loss and shows its financial position. Thus, measurement is an important part of accounting discipline. But a set of theorems governs the whole measurement sub- system. These theorems should be carefully understood to know how the cogs of the 'accounting-wheel' work. Now-a-days accounting profession earmarked three theorems namely going concern, consistency and accrual as fundamental accounting assumptions, i.e., these assumptions are taken for granted. Also while measuring, classifying, summarising and also presenting, various policies are adopted. Recording, classifying summarising and communication of information are also important part of accounting, which do not fall within the purview of measurement discipline. Therefore, we cannot simply say that accounting is a measurement discipline.\\nBut in accounting money is the unit of measurement. So, let us take one thing for granted that all transactions and events are to be recorded in terms of money only. Quantitative information is also required in many cases but such information is only supplementary to monetary information.\", 'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are:\\nHistorical Cost;\\nCurrent Cost:\\nRealizable Value;\\nPresent Value.\\nLet us discuss these principles in detail.\\nValuation Principles of Historical Cost: \\nIt means acquisition price. For example, the businessman paid  to purchase the machine and spend  on its installation, its acquisition price including installation charges is . The historical cost of machine would be ₹8,00,000.\\nAccording to this base, assets are recorded at an amount of cash or cash equivalent paid at the time of acquisition. Liabilities are recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business.\\nValuation Principles of Current Cost: \\nTake that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 at . As per historical cost base he has to record it at  i.e. the acquisition price. As on 1.1.2022, Mr. X found that it would cost ₹  to purchase that machine. Take also that Mr. X took loan from a bank as on 1.1.2011 ₹ 5,00,000 @ 18% p.a. repayable at the end of 15 th year together with interest. As on 1.1.2022 the bank announces  prepayment penalty on the loan amount if it is paid within 15 days starting from that day. As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000.\\nValuation Principles of Realisable Value: \\nSuppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently. Take also that Mr. X found that he had no money to pay off the bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 currently.\\nValuation Principles of Present Value: \\nSuppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference. Now think the machine purchased by Mr. X can work for another 10 years and is supposed to generate cash @ ₹ 1,00,000 p.a. Also take that bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 taken by Mr.  is to be repaid as on 31.12.2028. Annual interest is .', 'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are:\\nHistorical Cost;\\nCurrent Cost:\\nRealizable Value;\\nPresent Value.\\nLet us discuss these principles in detail.', 'Valuation Principles of Historical Cost: \\nIt means acquisition price.

Liabilities are recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business.\\nWhen a businessman, takes ₹ 5,00,000 loan from a bank @ 10% interest p.a., it is to be recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. Here the obligation is the repayment of loan as well as payment of interest at an agreed rate i.e. . Proceeds received are  - it is historical cost of the transactions.\\nTake another case regarding payment of income tax liability. You know every individual has to pay income tax on his income if it exceeds certain minimum limit. But the income tax liability is not settled immediately when one earns his income. The income tax authority settles it some time later, which is technically called assessment year. Then how does he record this liability? As per historical cost base it is to be recorded at an amount expected to be paid to discharge the liability.\\nCompanies usually apply historical cost method in case of long-term assets like machinery, furniture, licenses etc.', 'Valuation Principles of Current Cost: \\nTake that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 at . As per historical cost base he has to record it at  i.e. the acquisition price. As on 1.1.2022, Mr. X found that it would cost ₹  to purchase that machine. Take also that Mr. X took loan from a bank as on 1.1.2011 ₹ 5,00,000 @ 18% p.a. repayable at the end of 15 th year together with interest. As on 1.1.2022 the bank announces  prepayment penalty on the loan amount if it is paid within 15 days starting from that day. As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000.\\nCurrent cost gives an alternative measurement base. Assets are carried out at the amount of cash or cash equivalent that would have to be paid if the same or an equivalent asset was acquired currently. Liabilities are carried at the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents that would be required to settle the obligation currently.\\nSo as per current cost base, the machine value is  while the value of bank loan is ₹ 5,05,000.', 'Valuation Principles of Realisable Value: \\nSuppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently. Take also that Mr. X found that he had no money to pay off the bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 currently.\\nAs per realisable value, assets are carried at the amount of cash or cash equivalents that could currently be obtained by selling the assets in an orderly disposal. Haphazard disposal may yield something less. Liabilities are carried at their settlement values; i.e. the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents expressed to be paid to satisfy the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nSo, the machine should be recorded at ₹  the realisable value in an orderly sale while the bank loan should be recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 the settlement value in the normal course of business.\\nRealisable value concept is commonly applied in case of inventories. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.', \"Valuation Principles of Present Value: \\nSuppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference. Now think the machine purchased by Mr. X can work for another 10 years and is supposed to generate cash @ ₹ 1,00,000 p.a. Also take that bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 taken by Mr.  is to be repaid as on 31.12.2028. Annual interest is .\\nAs per present value, an asset is carried at the present discounted value of the future net cash inflows that the item is expected to generate in the normal course of business. Liabilities are carried at the present discounted value of future net cash outflows that are expected to be required to settle the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nThe concept of Present Value is common in case of accounting for investments and loans.\\nThe term 'discount', 'cash inflow' and 'cash outflow' need a little elaboration. ₹ 100 in hand as on 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 in hand as on 31.12.2022. There is a time gap of one year. If Mr. X had ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 he could use it at that time. If he received it only on 31.12.2022, he had to sacrifice his use for a year. The value of this sacrifice is called 'time value of money'. Mr.  would sacrifice i.e. he would agree to take money on 31.12.2022 if he had been compensated for the sacrifice. So a rational man will never exchange ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 with ₹ 100 to be received on 31.12.2022. Then ₹ 100 of 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 of 31.12.2022. To make the money receivable at a future date equal with the money of the present date it is to be devalued. Such devaluation is called discounting of future money.\\nPerhaps you know the compound interest rule: \\n Amount\\n Principal\\n interest \\n Time\\nThis equation gives the relationship between present money, principal and the future money amount. If  and  are given, to find out , the equation is to be changed slightly.\\n\\nUsing the equation one can find out the present value if he knows the values of  and .\\nSuppose , now what is the present value of  to be received as on 31.12.2022 (Take 1.1.2022 as the time of reference).\\n\\nSimilarly,\\nOn 31.12.2023, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹69,444.\\nOn 31.12.2024, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹57,870.\\nOn 31.12.2025, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹48,225.\\nOn 31.12.2026, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹40,188.\\nOn 31.12.2027, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹33,490.\\nOn 31.12.2028, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹27,908.\\nOn 31.12.2029, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹23,257.\\nOn 31.12.2030, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹19,381.\\nOn 31.12.2031, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹16,150. \\u200b\\nTotal of all these present values is ₹ 4,19,246. Since the machine purchased by Mr. X will produce cash equivalent to ₹ 4,19,246 in terms of present value, it is to be valued at such amount as per present value measurement basis.\\nHere, Mr.  will receive  at different points of time-these are cash inflows. In the other example, he has to pay interest and principal of bank loan-these are cash outflows.\\nPerhaps you also know the annuity rule:\\nPresent value of an Annuity or Re. A for  periods is\\nA = Annuity\\n interest\\n time , n.\\n\\nApplying this rule one can derive the present value of ₹ 1,00,000 for 10 years @ 20% p.a.\\n\\nSimilarly, the present value of bank loan is\\n\\n\\nThus, we get the four measurements as on 1.1.2022:\\nThe machine asset has a historical cost of ₹7,00,000, a current cost of ₹25,00,000, a realisable value of ₹20,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,19,246. The bank loan liability has a historical cost of ₹5,00,000, a current cost of ₹5,05,000, a realisable value of ₹5,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,70,094. \\u200b\\u200b\\nThe accounting system which we shall discuss in the remaining chapters is also called historical cost accounting. However, this need not mean that one shall follow only historical cost basis of accounting. In the later stages of the CA course, we shall see that the accounting system uses all types of measurement bases although under the traditional system most of the transactions and events are measured in terms of historical cost.\", 'MEASUREMENT AND VALUATION\\nValue relates to the benefits to be derived from objects, abilities or ideas. To the economist, value is the utility (i.e.; satisfaction) of an economic resource to the person contemplating or enjoying its use. In accounting, to mean value of an object, abilities or ideas, a monetary surrogate is used. That is to say, value is measured in terms of money. Suppose, an individual purchased a car paying . Its value lies in the satisfaction to be derived by that individual using the car in future. Economists often use ordinal scale to indicate the level of satisfaction. But accountants use only cardinal scales. If the value of car is taken as ₹ 2,50,000 it is only one type of value called acquisition cost or historical cost. So value is indicated by measurement. In accounting the value is always measured in terms of money.', 'ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\\nEarlier in this unit we have learned how to measure a transaction, which had already taken place and for which either some value/money has been paid or some valuation principles are to be adopted for their measurement. But there are certain items, which have not occurred therefore cannot be measured using valuation principles still they are necessary to record in the books of account, for example, provision for doubtful debts. For such items, we need some value. In such a situation reasonable estimates based on the existing situation and past experiences are made.\\nThe measurement of certain assets and liabilities is based on estimates of uncertain future events. As a result of the uncertainties inherent in business activities, many financial statement items cannot be measured with precision but can only be estimated. Therefore, the management makes various estimates and assumptions of assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses as on the date of preparation of financial statements. Such estimates are made in connection with the computation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses as well as, accruals, provisions and employee benefit obligations. Also estimates may be required in determining the bad debts, useful life and residual value of an item of plant and machinery and inventory obsolescence. The process of estimation involves judgements based on the latest information available.\\nAn estimate may require revision if changes occur regarding circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of new information, more experience or subsequent developments. Change in accounting estimate means difference arises between certain parameters estimated earlier and re-estimated during the current period or actual result achieved during the current period.\\nFew examples of situations wherein accounting estimates are needed can be given as follows:\\nA company incurs expenditure of  on development of patent. Now the company has to estimate that for how many years the patent would benefit the company. This estimation should be based on the latest information and logical judgement.\\nA company dealing in long-term construction contracts, uses percentage of completion method for recognizing the revenue at the end of the accounting year. Under this method the company has to make adequate provisions for unseen contingencies, which can take place while executing the remaining portion of the contract. Since provisioning for unseen contingencies requires estimation, there may be excess or short provisioning, which is to be adjusted in the period when it is recognised.\\nA company has to provide for taxes which is also based on estimation as there can be some interpretational differences on account of which tax authorities may either accept the expenditure or refuse it. This will ultimately lead to different tax liability.\\nCompany XY Ltd purchases a machine for ₹ 10 lac in 2021. The procurement head suggested that the machine is expected to offer benefits up to next 10 years. After 3 years of its use, the machine has become obsolete as new technologies are now available providing better productivity than the existing machine. Hence, it is now expected that the machine can only offer benefits for further 3 years. This is a change in estimate in the useful life of the machine.'])\n",
      "('CA-FO-P1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1-U3-Capital and Revenue Expenditures and Receipts', ['Introduction of Capital and Revenue Expenditures and Receipts\\nAccounting aims in ascertaining and presenting the results of the business for an accounting period. For ascertaining the periodical business results, the nature of transactions should be analyzed whether they are of capital or revenue nature. Revenue Expense relates to the operations of the business of an accounting period or to the revenue earned during the period or the items of expenditure, benefits of which do not extend beyond that period. Capital Expenditure, on the other hand, generates enduring benefits and helps in revenue generation over more than one accounting period. Revenue Expenses must be associated with a physical activity of the entity. Therefore, whereas production and sales generate revenue in the earning process, use of goods and services in support of those functions causes expenses to occur.\\nExpenses are recognised in the Profit & Loss Account through matching principal which tells us when and how much of the expenses to be charged against revenue. A part of the expenditure can be capitalised only when these can be traced directly to definable streams of future benefits.\\nThe distinction of transaction into revenue and capital is done for the purpose of placing them in Profit and Loss account or in the Balance Sheet. For example: revenue expenditures are shown in the profit and loss account as their benefits are for one accounting period i.e., in which they are incurred while capital expenditures are placed on the asset side of the balance sheet as they will generate benefits for more than one accounting period and will be transferred to profit and loss account of the year on the basis of utilisation of that benefit in particular accounting year. Hence, both capital and revenue expenditures are ultimately transferred to profit and loss account.\\nRevenue expenditures are transferred to profit and loss account in the year of spending while capital expenditures are transferred to profit and loss account of the year in which their benefits are utilised. Therefore, we can conclude that it is the time factor, which is the main determinant for transferring the expenditure to profit and loss account. Also, expenses are recognized in profit and loss account through matching concept which tells us when and how much of the expenses to be charged against revenue. However, distinction between capital and revenue creates a considerable difficulty. In many cases borderline between the two is very thin.', 'CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINING CAPITAL AND REVENUE EXPENDITURES\\nThe basic considerations in distinction between capital and revenue expenditures are:\\nNature of business: For a trader dealing in furniture, purchase of furniture is revenue expenditure but for any other trade, the purchase of furniture should be treated as capital expenditure and shown in the balance sheet as asset. Therefore, the nature of business is a very important criteria in separating an expenditure between capital and revenue.\\nRecurring nature of expenditure: If the frequency of an expense is quite often in an accounting year then it is said to be an expenditure of revenue nature while nonrecurring expenditure is infrequent in nature and do not occur often in an accounting year. Monthly salary or rent is the example of revenue expenditure as they are incurred every month while purchase of assets is not the transaction done regularly therefore, classified as capital expenditure unless materiality criteria defines it as revenue expenditure.\\nPurpose of expenses: Expenses for repairs of machine may be incurred in course of normal maintenance of the asset. Such expenses are revenue in nature. On the other hand, expenditure incurred for major repair of the asset so as to increase its productive capacity is capital in nature. However, determination of the cost of maintenance and ordinary repairs which should be expensed, as opposed to a cost which ought to be capitalised, is not always simple.\\nEffect on revenue generating capacity of business: The expenses which help to generate income/ revenue in the current period are revenue in nature and should be matched against the revenue earned in the current period. On the other hand, if expenditure helps to generate revenue over more than one accounting period, it is generally called capital expenditure.\\nWhen expenditure on improvements and repair of a fixed asset is done, it has to be charged to Profit and Loss Account if the expected future benefits from fixed assets do not change, and it will be included in book value of fixed asset, where the expected future benefits from assets increase.\\nMateriality of the amount involved: Relative proportion of the amount involved is another important consideration in distinction between revenue and capital.', 'CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND REVENUE EXPENDITURES\\nAs we have already discussed, capital expenditure contributes to the revenue earning capacity of a business over more than one accounting period whereas revenue expense is incurred to generate revenue for a particular accounting period. The revenue expenses either occur in direct relation with the revenue or in relation with accounting periods, for example cost of goods sold, salaries, rent, etc. Cost of goods sold is directly related to sales revenue whereas rent is related to the particular accounting period. Capital expenditure may represent acquisition of any tangible or intangible fixed assets for enduring future benefits. Therefore, the benefits arising out of capital expenditure last for more than one accounting period whereas those arising out of revenue expenses expire in the same accounting period.', 'Key differences between Capital and Revenue Expenditures\\nPeriod of benefit: Capital expenditure is any expenditure incurred to provide a benefit over a long-term period. Revenue expenditure is any expenditure incurred to provide a benefit during the current period.\\nEnhancement vs Maintenance: Capital expenditure is incurred for the purpose of increasing the capacity of the business or to reduce the costs of the business. Revenue expenditure is incurred to maintain the earning capacity of the business.\\nExamples: Capital expenditure includes purchases of machines, cars, furniture, etc. Revenue expenditure includes repairs and maintenance, salaries of accounting staff, etc.', \"CAPITAL RECEIPTS AND REVENUE RECEIPTS\\nJust as a clear distinction between Capital and Revenue expenditure is necessary, in the same manner capital receipts must be distinguished from revenue receipts.\\nReceipts which are obtained in course of normal business activities are revenue receipts (e.g., receipts from sale of goods or services, interest income etc.). On the other hand, receipts which are not revenue in nature are capital receipts (e.g., receipts from sale of fixed assets or investments, secured or unsecured loans, owners' contributions etc.). Revenue and capital receipts are recognised on accrual basis as soon as the right of receipt is established. Revenue receipts should not be equated with the actual cash receipts. Revenue receipts are credited to the Profit and Loss Account.\\nOn the other hand, Capital receipts are not directly credited to Profit and Loss Account. For example, when a fixed asset is sold for ₹ 92,000 (cost ₹ 90,000), the capital receipts ₹ 92,000 is not credited to Profit and Loss Account. Profit or Loss on sale of fixed assets is calculated and credited to Profit and Loss Account,\\nSale Proceeds                                    ₹ 92,000\\nCost                                                   (₹ 90,000)\\nProfit                                                   ₹ 2,000\"])\n",

It usually arises from unplanned or unexpected events that give rise to the possibility of an inflow of economic benefits to the business entity. For example, a claim that an enterprise is pursuing through legal process, where the outcome is uncertain, is a contingent asset.\\nAs per the concept of prudence as well as the present accounting standards, an enterprise should not recognise a contingent asset. These assets are uncertain and may arise from a claim which an enterprise pursues through a legal proceeding. There is uncertainty in realisation of claim. It is possible that recognition of contingent assets may result in recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset no longer remains as contingent asset.\\nA contingent asset need not be disclosed in the financial statements. A contingent asset is usually disclosed in the report of the approving authority (Board of Directors in the case of a company, and the corresponding approving authority in the case of any other enterprise), if an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and if it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change occurs.', 'CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\\nThe term \\'Contingent liability\\' can be defined as\\na possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise; or\\na present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:\\nit is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or\\na reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made.\"\\nFor example- Mr. X sells a machine to Mr. Y. Any damages incurred by Mr. Y while using the machine need to be compensated by Mr. X. A few days later from the date of sale of machine, Mr.  received a notice from Mr. Y who is claiming damages of ₹ 20 lac. The notice mentioned that a worker met with an accident during the use of the machine and is required to be compensated.\\nThe receipt of this notice does not suggest that Mr. X is liable to pay the amount, although this needs to be investigated and confirmed, as whether the damage arose due to any defect in the machine or it is due to negligence while operating the machine. Although, the receipt of the notice results into an event which requires recognition of a contingent liability since there is a possible obligation, and that can only be confirmed in future.\\nTaking another example let us assume Mr. AB sells cars to its customers. One of the cars caught fire due to malfunctioning of a faulty part during the test drive by one of the customers. The customer has filed a court case seeking a claim of ₹ 50 lac due to the incidence.\\nWhile Mr. AB acknowledges that there is a present obligation, it is not certain that whether he is expected to pay for any damages. The final outcome will only be known during the court proceedings.\\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and may arise in future depending on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events [part (a) of the definition]. A contingent liability may also be a present obligation that arises from past events [(part (b) of the definition)].\\nAn enterprise should not recognise a contingent liability in balance sheet, however it is required to be disclosed in the notes to accounts, unless possibility of outflow of a resource embodying economic benefits is remote. These liabilities are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits has become probable.\\nIf it becomes probable that an outflow or future economic benefits will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognised in financial statements of the period in which the change in probability occurs except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made.', 'DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND LIABILITIES\\nThe distinction between a liability and a contingent liability is generally based on the judgement of the management. A liability is defined as the present financial obligation of an enterprise, which arises from past events. The settlement of a liability results in an outflow from the enterprises of resources embodying economic benefits. On the other hand, in the case of contingent liability, either outflow of resources to settle the obligation is not probable or the amount expected to be paid to settle the liability cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\\nExamples of contingent liabilities are claims against the enterprise not acknowledged as debts, guarantees given in respect of third parties, liability in respect of bills discounted and statutory liabilities under dispute etc. In addition to present obligations that are recognized as liabilities in the balance sheet, enterprises are required to disclose contingent liability in their balance sheets by way of notes.', 'DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS\\nProvision means \"any amount written off or retained by way of providing for depreciation, renewal or diminution in the value of assets or retained by way of providing for any known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with substantial accuracy\".\\nIt is important to know the difference between provisions and contingent liabilities. The distinction between both of them can be explained as follows:\\nProvision is a present liability of uncertain amount that can be reliably measured using substantial estimation, whereas a contingent liability is a potential obligation dependent on uncertain future events.\\nA provision satisfies the recognition criteria, while a contingent liability does not meet these criteria.\\nProvision is acknowledged when there is a current obligation from past events likely to result in an economic benefit outflow, and the amount can be reliably estimated; in contrast, a contingent liability includes obligations not recognized due to uncertainty in benefit outflow or amount estimation.\\nManagement recognizes a provision in the balance sheet if it is probable that fulfilling an obligation will result in economic benefits outflow; conversely, if economic benefits outflow is unlikely, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability. \\u200b\\nLet us take an example to understand the distinction between provisions and contingent liabilities. The Central Excise Officer imposes a penalty on Alpha Ltd. for violation of a provision in the Central Excise Act. The company goes on an appeal. If the management of the company estimates that it is probable that the company will have to pay the penalty, it recognises a provision for the liability. On the other hand, if the management anticipates that the judgement of the appellate authority will be in its favour and it is less likely that the company will have to pay the penalty, it will disclose the obligation as a contingent liability instead of recognising a provision for the same.'])\n",
      "('CA-FO-P1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1-U1- Meaning and Scope of Accounting', [\"Introduction of Meaning and Scope of Accounting\\nEvery individual performs some kind of economic activity. A salaried person gets salary and spends to buy provisions and clothing, for children's education, construction of house, etc. A sports club formed by a group of individuals, a business run by an individual or a group of individuals, a company running a business in telecom sector, a local authority like Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Delhi Development Authority, Governments, either Central or State, all are carrying some kind of economic activities. Not necessarily all the economic activities are run for any individual benefit; such economic activities may create social benefit i.e. benefit for the public, at large. Anyway, such economic activities are performed through 'transactions and events'. Transaction is used to mean 'a business, performance of an act, an agreement' while event is used to mean 'a happening, as a consequence of transaction(s), a result.'\", 'MEANING OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe Committee on Terminology set up by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants formulated the following definition of accounting in 1961:\\n\"Accounting is the art of recording, classifying, and summarising in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of a financial character, and interpreting the result thereof.\"\\nAs per this definition, accounting is simply an art of record keeping. The process of accounting starts by first identifying the events and transactions which are of financial character and then be recorded in the books of account. Continuing with the same example of the telecom company, which needs to capture all transactions (transactions made by the user, raising invoice to the customer, receipt of money, payment towards salaries, marketing etc.). Likewise, the individual running the stationery business, would need to record all business transactions.\\nThis recording is done in Journal or subsidiary books, also known as primary books. Every good record keeping system includes suitable classification of transactions and events as well as their summarisation for ready reference. For example, the telecom company performing thousands of transactions on a daily basis, is not expected to publish all those transactions for the users to be able to make a decision. Surely, those transactions need to be summarized appropriately.\\nAfter the transactions and events are recorded, they are transferred to secondary books, i.e., Ledger. In ledger, transactions and events are classified in terms of income, expense, assets and liabilities according to their characteristics and summarised in profit and loss account and balance sheet.\\nEssentially the transactions and events are to be measured in terms of money. Measurement in terms of money means measuring at the ruling currency of a country, for example, rupee in India, dollar in U.S.A. and like. The transactions and events must have at least in part, financial characteristics. The inauguration of a new branch of a bank is an event without having financial character, while the business disposed of by the branch is an event having financial character. Accounting also interprets the recorded, classified and summarized transactions and events. However, the above-mentioned definition does not reflect the present day accounting function. According to the above definition, accounting ends with interpretation of the results of the financial transactions and events but in the modern world with the diversification of management and ownership, globalization of business and society gaining more interest in the functioning of the enterprises, the importance of communicating the accounting results has increased.\\nTherefore, this requirement of communicating and motivating informed judgement has also become the part of accounting as defined in the widely accepted definition of accounting, given by the American Accounting Association in 1966 which treated accounting as:\\n\"The process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgments and decisions by the users of accounts.\"\\nIn 1970, the Accounting Principles Board (APB) of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) enumerated the functions of accounting as follows:\\n\"The function of accounting is to provide quantitative information, primarily of financial nature, about economic entities, that is needed to be useful in making economic decisions.\"\\nThus, accounting may be defined as the process of recording, classifying, summarising, analysing and interpreting the financial transactions and communicating the results thereof to the persons interested in such information.\\nThe above definition requires accountants to assume a bigger responsibility than to merely do book-keeping. Accountants need to be ready to provide the information ready for the intended users to be able to make economic decisions.', 'Procedural aspects of Accounting\\nOn the basis of the above definitions, procedure of accounting can be basically divided into two parts:\\nGenerating financial information and\\nUsing the financial information.\\nGenerating Financial Information\\nRecording - This is the basic function of accounting. All business transactions of a financial character, as evidenced by some documents such as sales bill, pass book, salary slip etc. are recorded in the books of account. Recording is done in a book called \"Journal.\" This book may further be divided into several subsidiary books according to the nature and size of the business. Students will learn how to prepare journal and various subsidiary books in chapter 2.\\nClassifying - Classification is concerned with the systematic analysis of the recorded data, with a view to group transactions or entries of one nature at one place so as to put information in compact and usable form. The book containing classified information is called \"Ledger\". This book contains on different pages, individual account heads under which, all financial transactions of similar nature are collected. For example, there may be separate account heads for Salaries, Rent, Printing and Stationeries, Advertisement etc. All expenses under these heads, after being recorded in the Journal, will be classified under separate heads in the Ledger. This will help in finding out the total expenditure incurred under each of the above heads. Students will learn how to prepare ledger books in chapter 2.\\nSummarising - It is concerned with the preparation and presentation of the classified data in a manner useful to the internal as well as the external users of financial statements. This process leads to the preparation of the financial statements.\\nAnalysing - The term \\'Analysis\\' means methodical classification of the data given in the financial statements. The figures given in the financial statements will not help anyone unless they are in a simplified form. For example, all items relating to fixed assets are put at one place while all items relating to current assets are put at another place. It is concerned with the establishment of relationship between the items of the Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet i.e. it provides the basis for interpretation. Students will learn this aspect of financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course.\\nInterpreting - This is the final function of accounting. It is concerned with explaining the meaning and significance of the relationship as established by the analysis of accounting data. The recorded financial data is analysed and interpreted in a manner that will\\nenable the end-users to make a meaningful judgement about the financial condition and profitability of the business operations. The financial statement should explain not only what had happened but also why it happened and what is likely to happen under specified conditions.\\nCommunicating - It is concerned with the transmission of summarised, analysed and interpreted information to the end-users to enable them to make rational decisions. This is done through preparation and distribution of accounting reports, which include besides the usual profit and loss account and the balance sheet, additional information in the form of accounting ratios, graphs, diagrams, fund flow statements etc. Students will learn this aspect of financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course.\\nThe first two procedural stages of the process of generating financial information along with the preparation of trial balance are covered under book-keeping while the preparation of financial statements and its analysis, interpretation and also its communication to the various users are considered as accounting stages. Students will learn the term book-keeping and its distinction with accounting, in the coming topics of this unit.', \"Using the Financial Information\\nThere are certain users of accounts. Earlier it was viewed that accounting is meant for the proprietor or owner of the business, but changing social relationships diluted the earlier thinking. Since earlier businesses were simple and not scaled, probably that view could hold true for those.\\nIt is now believed that besides the owner or the management of the business enterprise, users of accounts include the investors, employees, lenders, suppliers, customers, government and other agencies and the public at large. For example, if an airlines company borrows money from a bank, buys oil from oil companies, sells tickets to the customers, has staff to be paid salaries to, all these group of people and entities are key stakeholders in that airlines business. They would like to know and understand whether the business of the company is going well or there are challenges for the company to run the business. Accounting provides the art of presenting information systematically to the users of accounts.\\nAccounting data is more useful if it stresses economic substance rather than technical form. Information is useless and meaningless unless it is relevant and material to a user's decision. The information should also be free of any biases. The users should understand not only the financial results depicted by the accounting figures, but also should be able to assess its reliability and compare it with information about alternative opportunities and the past experience. The owners or the management of the enterprise, commonly known as internal users, use the accounting information in an analytical manner to take the valuable decisions for\\nthe business. So the information served to them is presented in a manner different to the information presented to the external users. Even the small details which can affect the internal working of the business are given in the management report while financial statements presented to the external users contains key information regarding assets, liabilities and capital which are summarised in a logical manner that helps them in their respective decision-making.\", \"EVOLUTION OF ACCOUNTING AS A SOCIAL SCIENCE\\nHistory & Development of Accounting\\nAccounting finds its roots as early as around 4000 BC, where Egyptians used some form of accounting for their treasuries. The in-charge of treasuries had to send day wise reports to their superiors known as Wazirs and monthly reports were sent to kings. Babylonia, known as the city of commerce, used accounting for business to identify the losses that took place due to frauds and lack of efficiency. Greece used accounting to divide the revenues received among treasuries, maintaining receipts, payments and balance of government financial transactions. Romans used memorandum or daybook where in receipts and payments were recorded. (700 B.C to 400 A.D).\\nChina used sophisticated form of government accounting as early as 2000 B.C. Accounting practices in India could be traced back to a period where, Kautilya, a minister in Chandragupta's kingdom wrote a book named Arthashasthra, which also described how accounting records had to be maintained.\\nLuca Pacioli's, a Franciscan friar (merchant class), book Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportion at Proportionality (Review of Arithmetic and Geometric proportions) in Venice (1494) is considered as the first book on double entry bookkeeping. A portion of this book contains knowledge of business and book-keeping. He used the terms Debit (Dr.) and Credit (Cr.) in his books. These were the concepts used in Italian terminology. Debit comes from the Italian debito which comes from the Latin debita and debeo which means owed to the proprietor. Credit comes from the Italian credito which comes from the Latin 'credo' which means trust or belief (in the proprietor or owed by the proprietor.\\nIn explaining double entry system, Pacioli wrote that 'All entries... have to be double entries, that is if you make one creditor, you must make some debtor'. He also mentioned that a merchant's responsibility is to give glory to God in their enterprises, to be ethical in all business activities and to earn a profit. He discussed the details of memorandum, journal, ledger and specialised accounting procedures.\\nIn its oldest form, accounting aided the stewards to discharge their stewardship function. The wealthy men employed stewards to manage their property; the stewards in turn rendered an account periodically of their stewardship. This 'Stewardship Accounting' was the root of financial accounting system. Although double-entry system was followed, 'stewardship accounting' served the purpose of businessmen and wealthy persons at that time. In most of the countries, stewardship accounting was prevalent till the emergence of large-scale enterprises in the form of public limited companies.\\nIn the second phase, the idea of financial accounting emerged with the concept of joint stock company and divorce of ownership from the management. To safeguard the interest of the shareholders and investors, disclosure of financial statements (mainly, profit and loss account and balance sheet) and other accounting information was moulded by law. Financial statements give periodic performance report by way of profit and loss account and financial position at the end of the period by way of Balance Sheet. It got the legal status due to changing relationships between the owners, economic entity and the managers. With the democratisation of society, the relationships between the enterprise on the one hand, the investors, employees, managers and governments on the other, have also undergone a seachange. Also, the prospective investors and other business contact groups want to know a lot about the business before entering into transactions. Thus, financial accounting emerged as an information system to identify, measure and communicate useful information for informed judgements and decisions by a broad group of users. In the third phase, accounting information was generated to aid management decision- making in particular. It contributed a lot to improve the quality of management decisions. This new dimension of accounting is called Management Accounting and it is the development of 20th Century only. It is pervasive enough to cover all spheres of management decisions.\\nLastly, Social Responsibility Accounting is in the formative process, which aims at accounting for the social cost incurred by business as well as the social benefit, created by it. It emerges from the growing social awareness about the undesirable by-products of economic activities. While earning profit, an enterprise incurs numerous social costs like pollution, using the resources of society like materials, land, labour etc. To compensate for this social cost, in today's world, an enterprise is expected to generate some social benefits also like employment opportunities, recreation activities, more choice to customers at reasonable price, better quality products etc. Therefore, it is demanded that the accounting system should produce a report measuring the social cost incurred and social benefits generated.\\nSocial Science study man as a member of society; they concern about social processes and the results and consequences of social relationships. The usefulness of accounting to society as a whole is the fundamental criterion to treat it as a social science. Although individuals may benefit from the availability of accounting information, the accounting system generates information for social good. It serves social purpose, it contributes for social progress; also it is being adapted to keep pace with social progress. So, accounting is treated as a social science.\", \"OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe objectives of accounting can be given as follows:\\nSystematic recording of transactions - Basic objective of accounting is to systematically record the financial aspects of business transactions, i.e., book-keeping. These recorded transactions are later on classified and summarized logically for the preparation of financial statements and for their analysis and interpretation.\\nAscertainment of results of above recorded transactions - Accountant prepares profit and loss account to know the results of business operations for a particular period of time. If revenue (Sales) exceeds expenses then it is said that business is running profitably but if expenses exceed revenue, then it can be said that business is running under loss. The profit and loss account helps the management and different stakeholders in taking rational decisions. For example, if business is not proved to be remunerative or profitable, the cause of such a state of affair can be investigated by the management for taking remedial steps.\\nAscertainment of the financial position of the business - A businessman is not only interested in knowing the results of the business in terms of profits or loss for a particular period but is also anxious to know that what he owes (liability) to the outsiders and what he owns (assets) on a certain date. To know this, accountant prepares a financial position statement popularly known as Balance Sheet. The balance sheet is a statement of assets and liabilities of the business at a particular point of time and helps in ascertaining the financial health of the business.\\nProviding information to the users for rational decision-making - Accounting as a 'language of business' communicates the financial results of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. Accounting aims to meet the information needs of the decision-makers and helps them in rational decision-making.\\nTo know the solvency position - By preparing the balance sheet, management not only reveals what is owned and owed by the enterprise, but also it gives the information regarding concern's ability to meet its liabilities in the short run (liquidity position) and also in the long-run (solvency position) as and when they fall due.\", 'An overview of objectives of accounting is depicted  below:\\nObjectives of Accounting\\nAccounting aims to fulfill several key objectives, which are essential for the proper management and financial transparency of a business or organization:\\nSystematic Recording of Transactions: The foundation of accounting is the methodical recording of all business transactions. This is achieved through the process of bookkeeping, which utilizes tools such as:\\nJournal: A chronological record of all transactions.\\nLedger: A set of accounts where transactions are categorized.\\nTrial Balance: A statement that ensures that the sum of debits equals the sum of credits, verifying the mathematical accuracy of the bookkeeping.\\nAscertainment of Results: Accounting helps in determining the operational outcome of a business over a period, usually in terms of profit or loss. This is done through:\\nManufacturing Account: A statement showing the cost of production.\\nTrading Account: A summary of the trading activities, showing the gross profit or loss.\\nProfit and Loss Account: An account that details the expenses and revenues, culminating in the net profit or loss.\\nAscertainment of Financial Position: Through accounting, a business can determine its financial standing at a specific point in time. This objective is primarily achieved by preparing:\\nBalance Sheet: A financial statement that lists assets, liabilities, and equity, depicting the financial position of the business.\\nCommunicating Information to Various Users: Accounting serves to communicate financial information to a diverse set of users, which is crucial for decision-making. The information is disseminated through:\\nFinancial Reports: Documents such as income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and equity statements that provide detailed financial information to stakeholders.\\nThese objectives are integral to the discipline of accounting, ensuring that all financial information is recorded accurately, results are clearly ascertained, financial positions are transparent, and information is effectively communicated to all relevant stakeholders.', 'Top of Form\\nFUNCTIONS OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe main functions of accounting are as follows:\\nMeasurement: Accounting measures past performance of the business entity and depicts its current financial position.\\nForecasting: Accounting helps in forecasting future performance and financial position of the enterprise using past data and analysing trends.\\nDecision-making: Accounting provides relevant information to the users of accounts to aid rational decision-making.\\nComparison & Evaluation: Accounting assesses performance achieved in relation to targets and discloses information regarding accounting policies and contingent liabilities which play an important role in predicting, comparing and evaluating the financial results.\\nControl: Accounting also identifies weaknesses of the operational system and provides feedbacks regarding effectiveness of measures adopted to check such weaknesses.\\nGovernment Regulation and Taxation: Accounting provides necessary information to the government to exercise control on the entity as well as in collection of tax revenues.', \"BOOK-KEEPING\\nBook-keeping is an activity concerned with the recording of financial data relating to business operations in a significant and orderly manner. It covers procedural aspects of accounting work and embraces record keeping function. Obviously, book-keeping procedures are governed by the end product, the financial statements. The term 'financial statements' means Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet and cash flow statements including Schedules and Notes forming part of Accounts.\\nBook-keeping also requires suitable classification of transactions and events. This is also determined with reference to the requirement of financial statements. A book-keeper may be responsible for keeping all the records of a business or only of a minor segment, such as position of the customers' accounts in a departmental store. Accounting is based on a careful and efficient book-keeping system.\\nThe essential idea behind maintaining book-keeping records is to show correct position regarding each head of income and expenditure. A business may purchase goods on credit as well as in cash. When the goods are bought on credit, a record must be kept of the person to whom money is owed. The proprietor of the business may like to know, from time to time, what amount is due on credit purchase and to whom. If proper record is not maintained, it is not possible to get details of the transactions in regard to the income and expenses. At the end of the accounting period, the proprietor wants to know how much profit has been earned or loss has been incurred during the course of the period. For this lot of information is needed which can be gathered from a proper record of the transactions. Therefore, in book-keeping, the proper maintenance of books of account is indispensable for any business.\\nAt this level, the major concern of the curriculum is with book-keeping and preparation of financial statements. It seems important to mention at this point that book-keeping and preparation of financial statements have legal implications also. Maintenance of books of accounts and the preparation of financial statements of a company are guided by the Companies Act, banks and insurance companies by special Acts governing these institutions and so on. However, for sole-proprietorship and partnership business, there is no specific legislation regarding maintenance of books of accounts and preparation of financial statements.\", 'Objectives of Book-keeping\\nComplete Recording of Transactions - It is concerned with complete and permanent record of all transactions in a systematic and logical manner to show its financial effect on the business.\\nAscertainment of financial Effect on the Business - It is concerned with the combined effect of all the transactions made during the accounting period upon the financial position of the business as a whole.', 'DISTINCTION BETWEEN BOOK-KEEPING AND ACCOUNTING\\nSome people mistake book-keeping and accounting to be synonymous terms, but in fact they are different from each other. Accounting is a broad subject. It calls for a greater understanding of records obtained from book-keeping and an ability to analyse and interpret the information provided by book-keeping records. Book-keeping is the recording phase while accounting is\\nconcerned with the summarising phase of an accounting system. Book-keeping provides necessary data for accounting and accounting starts where book-keeping ends.\\nTop of Form\\nBook-keeping: This is a process primarily concerned with the systematic recording of financial transactions.\\nAccounting: This process entails summarizing and interpreting the transactions that have been recorded during book-keeping.\\nBook-keeping: It lays the foundation for the accounting process.\\nAccounting: It acts as a comprehensive language that communicates the financial health and performance of a business.\\nBook-keeping: The creation of financial statements is not a function of book-keeping.\\nAccounting: Financial statements are generated within this process, utilizing the initial records from book-keeping.\\nBook-keeping: It does not provide the necessary information for managerial decision-making.\\nAccounting: It enables management to make informed decisions based on the analysis of book-keeping records.\\nBook-keeping: This field does not extend into specialized sub-categories.\\nAccounting: It encompasses various sub-disciplines, such as financial accounting and management accounting.\\nBook-keeping: The financial position of a business cannot be deduced solely from book-keeping records.\\nAccounting: It allows for the determination of the financial position through detailed accounting reports derived from book-keeping data.\\nThis comparative outline clarifies the distinct roles and contributions of book-keeping and accounting within the financial recording and reporting processes of a business.', \"Relationship of Accounting and Book-keeping can be depicted in the following chart as\\nThe Hierarchy of Financial Recording and Reporting\\nThe field of financial management is structured into distinct yet interrelated layers, each building upon the foundational practices of the previous one. This hierarchy can be visualized as:\\nAccountancy: This is the broadest category within this financial hierarchy. It encompasses all the activities related to the management of financial information, including the processes of accounting and bookkeeping, along with the analytical tasks that inform strategic decision-making.\\nAccounting: Nested within accountancy, accounting refers to the systematic process of recording, summarizing, and reporting the financial transactions of a business. It provides a comprehensive view of the financial activities through the creation of various financial statements and reports.\\nBookkeeping: At the core of this hierarchy lies bookkeeping, which is a subset of accounting. It is the initial phase of the accounting process, focusing on the meticulous and detailed recording of each financial transaction in chronological order. Bookkeeping is essential for providing the raw financial data that will be further analyzed and interpreted in the accounting process.\\nIn essence, bookkeeping serves as the groundwork for accounting, which in turn is a critical component of the broader discipline of accountancy. Each level in this hierarchy is crucial for the accurate and effective management of a business's financial information.\", 'SUB-FIELDS OF ACCOUNTING\\nThe various sub-fields of accounting are:\\nFinancial Accounting - It covers the preparation and interpretation of financial statements and communication to the users of accounts. It is historical in nature as it records transactions which had already been occurred. The final step of financial accounting is the preparation of Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet. It primarily helps in determination of the net result for an accounting period and the financial position as on the given date.\\nManagement Accounting - It is concerned with internal reporting to the managers of a business unit. To discharge the functions of stewardship, planning, control and decision- making, the management needs variety of information. The different ways of grouping information and preparing reports as desired by managers for discharging their functions are referred to as management accounting. A very important component of the management accounting is cost accounting which deals with cost ascertainment and cost control. Management Accounting will be dealt with at higher levels of the Chartered Accountancy Course.\\nCost Accounting - The terminology of Cost Accounting published by the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of England defines cost accounting as:\\n\"the process of accounting for cost which begins with the recording of income and expenditure or the bases on which they are calculated and ends with the preparation of periodical statements and reports for ascertaining and controlling costs.\"\\nSocial Responsibility Accounting - The demand for social responsibility accounting stems from increasing social awareness about the undesirable by-products of economic activities. As already discussed earlier, social responsibility accounting is concerned with accounting for social costs incurred by the enterprise and social benefits created.\\nHuman Resource Accounting - Human resource accounting is an attempt to identify, quantify and report investments made in human resources of an organisation that are not presently accounted for under conventional accounting practice.', \"USERS OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\\nGenerally users of accounts are classified into two categories, (a) internal users and (b) external users. Management accounting is concerned with identifying information requirements as well as methods of providing such information to management while information requirements of the outside users are generally served by financial statements. Following are the various users of accounting information:\\nInvestors: They provide risk capital to the business. They need information to assess whether to buy, hold or sell their investment. Also they are interested to know the ability of the business to survive, prosper and to pay dividend. In non-corporate sector, where ownership and management are not essentially separated, the owners still need information about performance of the business and its financial position to decide whether to continue or shut down.\\nEmployees: Growth of the employees is directly related to the growth of the organisation and therefore, they are interested to know the stability, continuity and growth of the enterprise and its ability to provide remuneration, retirement and other benefits and to enhance employment opportunities.\\nLenders: They are interested to know whether their loan-principal and interest will be paid back when due.\\nSuppliers and Creditors: They are also interested to know the ability of the enterprise to pay their dues, that helps them to decide the credit policy for the relevant concern, rates to be charged and so on. Sometimes, they also become interested in long-term continuation of the enterprise if their existence becomes dependent on the survival of that business.\\nCustomers: Customers are also concerned with the stability and profitability of the enterprise because their functioning is more or less dependent on the supply of goods, suppose, a company produces some chemicals used by pharmaceutical companies and supplies chemicals on three month's credit. If all of a sudden it faces some trouble and is unable to supply the chemical, the customers will also be in trouble.\\nGovernment and their agencies: They regulate the functioning of business enterprises for public good, allocate scarce resources among competing enterprises, control prices, charge excise duties and taxes, and so they have continued interest in the business enterprise.\\nPublic: The public at large is interested in the functioning of the enterprise because it may make a substantial contribution to the local economy in many ways including the number of people employed and their patronage to local suppliers.\\nManagement: Management as whole is also interested in the accounts for various managerial decisions. On the basis of the accounts, management determines the effects of their various decisions on the functioning of the organisation. This helps them to make further managerial decisions.\", \"RELATIONSHIP OF ACCOUNTING WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES\\nAccounting is closely related with several other disciplines and thus to acquire a good knowledge in accounting one should be conversant with the relevant portions of such disciplines. In many cases they overlap accounting. The accountant should have a working knowledge of the related disciplines so that he can understand such overlapping areas and apply the knowledge of other disciplines in his own work wherever possible, or he can take the expert advice.\\nAccounting and Economics: Economics is viewed as a science of rational decisionmaking about the use of scarce resources. It is concerned with the analysis of efficient use of scarce resources for satisfying human wants. This may be viewed either from the perspective of a single firm or of the country as a whole.\\nAccounting and Statistics: The use of statistics in accounting can be appreciated better in the context of the nature of accounting records. Accounting information is very precise; it is exact to the last paisa. But, for decision-making purposes such precision is not necessary and hence, the statistical approximations are sought.\\nAccounting and Mathematics: Double Entry book-keeping can be converted in algebraic form; in fact the first known book on this subject was part of a treatise on algebra. The fundamental accounting equation will be discussed in detail under 'Dual Aspect Concept' of this chapter.\\nAccounting and Law: An economic entity operates within a legal environment. All transactions with suppliers and customers are governed by the Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act, the Negotiable Instruments Act, etc. The entity itself is created and controlled by laws. For example, a company is created by the Companies Act and also controlled by Companies Act.\\nAccounting and Management: Management is a broad occupational field, which comprises many functions and encompasses application of many disciplines including those mentioned above. Accountants are well placed in the management and play a key role in the management team. A large portion of accounting information is prepared for management decision-making. Although management relies on other data sources, accounting data are used as basic source documents. In the management team, an accountant is in a better position to understand and use such data. In other words, since an accountant plays an active role in management, he understands the data requirements. So the accounting system can be moulded to serve the management purpose.\", \"RELATIONSHIP OF ACCOUNTING WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES\\nAccounting is closely related with several other disciplines and thus to acquire a good knowledge in accounting one should be conversant with the relevant portions of such disciplines. In many cases they overlap accounting. The accountant should have a working knowledge of the related disciplines so that he can understand such overlapping areas and apply the knowledge of other disciplines in his own work wherever possible, or he can take the expert advice.\\nRelationship of Accounting and Economics: Economics is viewed as a science of rational decision making about the use of scarce resources. It is concerned with the analysis of efficient use of scarce resources for satisfying human wants. This may be viewed either from the perspective of a single firm or of the country as a whole.\\nAccounting is viewed as a system, which provides data to the users to permit informed judgement and decisions. Some non-accounting data are also relevant for decision making.\\nAccounting overlaps economics in many respects. It contributed a lot in improving the management decision-making process. But, economic theories influenced the development of the decision-making tools used in accounting.\\nHowever, there exists a wide gulf between economists' and accountants' concepts of income and capital. Accountants got the ideas of value, income and capital maintenance from economists, but brushed suitably to make them usable in practical circumstances. Accountants developed the valuation, measurement and decisionmaking techniques which may owe to the economic theorems for origin but these are moulded in the work environment and suitably tempered with reference to relevance, verifiability, freedom from bias, timeliness, comparability, reliability and understandability.\\nAn example may be given to explain the nexus between accounting and economics. Economists think that value of an asset is the present value of all future earnings which can be derived from such assets. Now think about a plant whose working life is more than one hundred years. How can you estimate future stream of earnings? So accountants developed the workable valuation base - the acquisition cost i.e., the price paid to acquire the assets.\\nAt the macro-level, accounting provides the database over which the economic decision models have been developed; micro-level data arranged by the accounting system is summed up to get macro-level database.\\nNon-overlapping zones of accounting are not negligible. Development of the systems of recording, classifying and summarising transactions and events, harmonising the systems by uniform rules and communicating the data is essentially a non-overlapping area of accounting.\", 'Relationship of Accounting and Statistics: The use of statistics in accounting can be appreciated better in the context of the nature of accounting records. Accounting information is very precise; it is exact to the last paisa. But, for decision-making purposes such precision is not necessary and hence, the statistical approximations are sought.\\nIn accounts, all values are important individually because they relate to business transactions. As against this, statistics is concerned with the typical value, behaviour or trend over a period of time or the degree of variation over a series of observations. Therefore, wherever a need arises for only broad generalisations or the average of relationships, statistical methods have to be applied in accounting data.\\nFurther, in accountancy, the classification of assets and liabilities as well as the heads of income and expenditure has been done as per the needs of financial recording to ascertain financial results of various operations. Other types of classification like the geographical and historical ones and ad hoc classification are done depending on the purpose to make such classification meaningful.\\nAccounting records generally take a short-term view of events and are confined to a year while statistical analysis is more useful if a longer view is taken for the purpose. For example, to fit the trend line a longer period will be required. However, statistical methods do use past accounting records maintained on a consistent basis.\\nThe functional relations showing mathematical relations of one variable with one or more other variables are based on statistical work. These relations are used widely in making cost or price estimates for some estimated future values assigned to the given independent variables. For example, given the functional relation of total cost to the price of an input, the effect of changes in future prices on the cost of production can be calculated.\\nIn accountancy, a number of financial and other ratios are based on statistical methods, which help in averaging them over a period of time. Several accounting and financial calculations are based on statistical formulae.\\nStatistical methods are helpful in developing accounting data and in their interpretation. For example, time series and cross-sectional comparison of accounting data is based on statistical techniques. Now- a-days multiple discriminate analysis is popularly used to identify symptoms of sickness of a business firm. Therefore, the study and application of statistical methods would add extra edge to the accounting data.', \"Relationship of Accounting and Mathematics: Double Entry book-keeping can be converted in algebraic form; in fact the first known book on this subject was part of a treatise on algebra. The fundamental accounting equation will be discussed in detail under 'Dual Aspect Concept' of this chapter.\\nKnowledge of arithmetic and algebra is a pre-requisite for accounting computations and measurements. Calculations of interest and annuity are the examples of such fundamental uses. While computing depreciation, finding out installments in hire purchase and instalments payment transactions, calculating amount to be set aside for repayment of loan and replacement of assets and calculating lease rentals, mathematical techniques are frequently used. Accounting data are also presented in ratio form.\\nWith the advent of the computer, mathematics is becoming a vital part of accounting. Instead of writing accounts in traditional fashion, the transactions and events can be recorded in the matrix form and the rules of matrix algebra can be applied for classifying and summarising data.\\nNow-a-days statistics and econometric models are largely used for developing decision models for the users of accounts. Also, Operations Research Techniques provide lot of decision models. Since accounting is meant for providing information to the users, to be effective, accounting data should feed the information requirements of such statistical, econometric and operations research models. Understanding mathematics has become a must to grasp the decision models framed by statisticians, econometricians and the O.R. experts.\\nPresently graphs and charts are being extensively used for communicating accounting information. In addition to statistical knowledge, knowledge in geometry and trigonometry seems to be essential to have a better understanding about the accounting communications system.\", 'Relationship of Accounting and Law: An economic entity operates within a legal environment. All transactions with suppliers and customers are governed by the Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act, the Negotiable Instruments Act, etc. The entity itself is created and controlled by laws. For example, a company is created by the Companies Act and also controlled by Companies Act.\\nSimilarly, every country has a set of economic, fiscal and labour laws. Transactions and events are always guided by laws of the land. Very often the accounting system to be followed has been prescribed by the law. For example, the Companies Act has prescribed the format of financial statements for companies.\\nBanking, insurance and electric supply undertakings may also have to produce financial statements as prescribed by the respective legislations controlling such entities.\\nHowever, legal prescription about the accounting system is the product of developments in accounting knowledge. That is to say, legislation about accounting system cannot be enacted unless there is a corresponding development in the accounting discipline. In that way accounting influences law and is also influenced by law.', 'Relationship of Accounting and Management: Management is a broad occupational field, which comprises many functions and encompasses application of many disciplines including those mentioned above. Accountants are well placed in the management and play a key role in the management team. A large portion of accounting information is prepared for management decision-making. Although management relies on other data sources, accounting data are used as basic source documents. In the management team, an accountant is in a better position to understand and use such data. In other words, since an accountant plays an active role in management, he understands the data requirements. So the accounting system can be moulded to serve the management purpose.', \"Relationship of Limitations of Accounting\\nThere are certain misconceptions regarding financial statements. A common man presumes that an income statement shows the correct income or loss of the enterprise and that a balance sheet depicts a perfectly true and fair picture of financial standing of that enterprise. It must be recognised that the accounting as a language has its own limitations. The figures of profit or loss generated by the accounting process are subject to various constraints within which the accounting works. The assumptions and conventions, on which the accounting is based, become the limitations of accounting. The financial statements are never free from subjectivity factor as these are largely the outcome of personal judgement of the accountant with regard to the adoption of the accounting policies. Following are certain instances:\\nThe factors which may be relevant in assessing the worth of the enterprise don't find place in the accounts as they cannot be measured in terms of money. The Balance sheet cannot reflect the value of certain factors like loyalty and skill of the personnel which may be the most valuable asset of an enterprise these days.\\nBalance Sheet shows the position of the business on the day of its preparation and not on the future date while the users of the accounts are interested in knowing the position of the business in the near future and also in long run and not for the past date.\\nAccounting ignores changes in some money factors like inflation etc.\\nThere are occasion when accounting principles conflict with each other.\\nCertain accounting estimates depend on the sheer personal judgement of the accountant, e.g., provision for doubtful debts, method of depreciation adopted, recording certain expenditure as revenue expenditure or capital expenditure, selection of method of valuation of inventories and the list is quite long.\\nFinancial statements consider those assets which can be expressed in monetary terms. Human resources although the very important asset of the enterprise are not shown in the balance sheet. There is no generally accepted formula for the valuation of human resources in money terms.\\nDifferent accounting policies for the treatment of same item adds to the probability of manipulations. Though through various laws and Accounting Standards, efforts are made to reduce these options to minimum but certainly could not be reduced to one.\\nIn nutshell, it can be said that the language of accounting has certain practical limitations and, therefore, the financial statements should be interpreted carefully keeping in mind all various factors influencing the true picture.\", 'ROLE OF ACCOUNTANT IN THE SOCIETY\\nThere are only a few types of profession in the world which are held in high esteem in public eyes and there is no denying the fact that the accounting profession is one of them. Goethe had called the accountant’s profession as ‘the fairest invention of the human mind’. At the core of all types of learned profession, there is the desire of public good and of finding the best way to serve society. By the use of the science of accountancy and under the spell of its art, a dynamic pattern which assists business in planning its future is woven by accountants out of the inert mass of non-speaking silent figures. This is what makes their profession an instrument of socio-economic change and welfare of the society.\\nAn accountant with his education, training, analytical mind and experience is best qualified to provide multiple need-based services to the ever growing society. The accountants of today can do full justice not only to matters relating to taxation, costing, management accounting, financial lay-out, company legislation and procedures but they can delve deep into the fields relating to financial policies, budgetary policies and even economic principles. The area of activities which can be undertaken by the accountants is not limited but it can also cover many additional facets.', \"Areas of Service\\nThe practice of accountancy has crossed its usual domain of preparation of financial statements, interpretation of such statements and audit thereof. Accountants are presently taking active role in company laws and other corporate legislation matters, in taxation laws matters (both direct and indirect) and in general management problems. Some of the services rendered by accountants to the society are briefly mentioned hereunder:\\nMaintenance of Books of Accounts: An accountant is able to maintain a systematic record of financial transactions in order to establish the net result of the transactions entered into during a period and to state the financial position of the concern as at a particular date.\\nFor the fulfillment of the twin objective of ascertaining the profit earned or loss suffered and the financial position, it is necessary that all transactions be recorded in a systematic manner, which can be done only by an accountant. Proper maintenance of books of accounts assists management in planning, decision-making, controlling functions.\\nStatutory Audit: Every limited company is required to appoint a chartered accountant or a firm of chartered accountants as their auditor who are statutorily required to report each year whether in their opinion the balance sheet shows a true and fair view of the state of affairs on the balance sheet date, and the profit and loss account shows a true and fair view of the profit or loss for the year.\\nAuditing is not confined to the accounts of companies; other organisations may also have their accounts audited, either because the law so requires (for example, the Co-operative Societies Act, the Income-tax Act, etc.) or because the proprietors wisely decided so (for example, a partnership firm or an individual trader).\\nInternal Audit: It is a management tool whereby an internal auditor thoroughly examines the accounting transactions and also the system, according to which these have been recorded with a view to ensure the management that the accounts are being properly maintained and the system contains adequate safeguards to check any leakage of revenue or misappropriation of property or assets and the operations have been carried out in conformity with the plans of management.\\nNow-a-days internal auditing has developed as a service to management. The internal auditor constructively contributes in improving the operational efficiency of the business through an independent review and appraisal of all business operations.\\nTaxation: An accountant can handle taxation matters of a business or a person and he can represent that business or person before the tax authorities and settle the tax liability\\nunder the statute prevailing. He can also assist in avoiding or reducing tax burden by proper planning of tax affairs.\\nAccountants also have a social obligation to express their views on broad tax policy, on the effect of tax rate on business and the economy in general and on all other aspects of taxation in which they have knowledge superior to that of the general public.\\nManagement Accounting and Consultancy Services: Management accountant performs an advisory function. He is largely responsible for internal reporting to the management for planning and controlling current operations, decision-making on special matters and for formulating long-range plans. His job is to collect, analyse, interpret and present all accounting information which is useful to the management. Accountant provides management consultancy services in the areas of management information system, expenditure control and evaluation of appraisal techniques for new investments and divestments, working capital management, corporate planning etc.\\nFinancial Advice: Many people need help and guidance in planning their personal financial affairs. An accountant who knows about finances, taxation and family problems is well placed to give such advice. Some of the areas in which an accountant can render financial advice are:\\nInvestments: An accountant can explain the significance of the formidable documents which shareholders receive from companies and help in making decisions relating to their investments.\\nInsurance: An accountant can provide information to his clients on various insurance policies and helps in choosing appropriate policy.\\nBusiness Expansion: As businesses grow in size and complexity and mergers are being considered, accountants are in the forefront in interpreting accounts, making suggestions as to the form of schemes and the fairness of proposals considering cost and financial consequences and generally advising their clients. They also advise on how to set about the problem of borrowing money or whether this is an appropriate method of finance. Accountants can render extremely useful service in connection of negotiations with foreign collaborators.\\nInvestigations: Financial investigations are required for a variety of purposes. Examples are:\\nTo ascertain the financial position of a business, for the information of interested parties in connection with an issue of capital, the purchase or sale of the business or a reconstruction or amalgamation.\\nTo help the management to decide whether it is cheaper to manufacture an article or to buy out.\\nTo ascertain why profits have fallen.\\nTo achieve greater efficiency in management.\\nTo ascertain whether fraud has occurred and if so, its nature and extent and to make suggestions which will help to prevent a recurrence.\\nTo value businesses and shares in private companies for purposes such as purchase, sale, estate duty or wealth tax etc.\\nFor such problems requiring financial investigation, you need an accountant. His task as an independent professional is to establish the facts fairly and clearly for the benefit of those who have to make decisions and to give advice in many areas in which he has competence and experience.\\nPension schemes: Specialist advice from actuaries, insurance agents or insurance company is needed before launching or amending a provident fund or pension scheme in a business. But before making a final decision, an accountant has to be consulted. Later on, his help may be needed for managing the scheme or obtaining tax relief.\\nOther Services\\nSecretarial Work: Companies, clubs, and associations indeed, virtually all organisations involve secretarial work. Accountants frequently do this work.\\nShare Registration Work: Accountants are often used by many companies to undertake the work involved in registering share transfers and new issues.\\nCompany Formation: In conjunction with legal advisers, accountants help in the formation of a company or advise against doing so.\\nReceiverships, Liquidations, etc.: An accountant has to sometimes take on the onerous duties of liquidator when a company is being wound up or receiver when a debenture holder exercises a right to recover a loan on which the borrower has defaulted. Accountant is just the man for the job. He is also just the man to help you to keep insolvency away if you consult him in time.\\nArbitrations: At times, accountants are invited by parties to act as arbitrators in a dispute or settle disputes of various kinds.\\nAs regards the Cost Accounts: A cost accountant's job is to continuously report cost data and related information at frequent intervals to the management.\\n(g) Accountant and Information Services: An accountant will be effective in his role if he supplies the information promptly and in an unambiguous language. He should develop a system by which there is a regular flow of information both horizontally and vertically.\\nThe information system should be such that comparability of financial statement is possible both business-wise and year-wise so that it benefits both the management and the investors. Dependence on data from the computerised information system will put new responsibilities on an accountant but his product will command greater attention and respect.\", \"Chartered Accountant in Industry\\nAn accountant, though he is a part of the highest planning team is not a planner in an industry. He works with the functional departments and translates the organisation's aims in terms of financial expectations. Therefore, he has to make a thorough study of the business and of individuals in the functional departments, whether they are engineers or salesmen. A qualified accountant will be able to play an important role in performing important functions of a business relating to accounting, costing and budgetary control, estimating and treasury.\", 'Chartered Accountant in Public Sector Enterprises\\nBoth in the developed and developing countries, public sector enterprises have become a special feature of the national economy. The system of financial and budgetary control and of accounting, auditing and reporting has, therefore, become a matter of interest and concern to the nation, and does not remain confined merely to a limited number of shareholders. The form of accounting followed by these corporations or companies is different from that of ordinary government accounting. It is the duty of the accountants to prepare the accounts and reports of these public corporations in such a way that they enable the general public to know how far the items appearing in the various types of records and financial statements justify their existence.', 'Chartered Accountant in Framing Fiscal Policies\\nAccountants have a positive role to play in the determination of proper fiscal policies and advancement of trade, commerce and industry. They should develop new techniques and prepare themselves for new fields of service towards their commitment to the concept of the public goods and services. A business enterprise can be successful in the commercial sense only if accounting and business knowledge are pooled together. It is a social obligation for both accountants in industry and in practice to disclose greater information regarding the corporate results. The state of affairs of the economy can be ascertained only when such consolidated corporate information is disclosed.', 'Chartered Accountant and Economic Growth\\nIn the present times accountants should conceive their duties as broadly as the conditions might require and do not restrict them to only literal compliance of the law. Their aim should be not to allow any individual to gain at the cost of the nation. Accountants have to accept a positive role and do their best to encourage efficiency in individual business units and encourage those social objectives which form the main foundation of a welfare state.'])\n",
      "('CA-FO-P1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1-U2-Accounting Concepts, Principles and Conventions', ['ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES AND CONVENTIONS\\nTop of Form\\nFundamental Accounting Concepts and Conventions\\nAccounting is governed by a set of underlying principles and conventions that ensure uniformity, reliability, and comparability of financial statements. These include:\\nEntity Concept: This principle dictates that the business is treated as a separate entity from its owners or other businesses, with its own set of financial records.\\nMoney Measurement Concept: According to this convention, only transactions that can be measured in monetary terms are recorded in the accounting books.\\nPeriodicity Concept: This concept facilitates the division of the continuous life of an enterprise into periodic intervals, usually a year, to produce financial reports.\\nAccrual Concept: This principle states that income and expenses are recognized when they are earned or incurred, not necessarily when the cash is received or paid.\\nMatching Concept: This concept advises that expenses should be matched with revenues in the period in which the revenue was earned, leading to an accurate calculation of profit or loss.\\nGoing Concern Concept: When preparing financial statements, it is assumed that the business will continue to operate and will not be forced to halt operations or liquidate assets.\\nCost Concept: This convention maintains that all assets are recorded in the books of accounts at their purchase price, which includes cost of acquisition, transportation, and installation and not their market price.\\nRealisation Concept: Revenue is recognized at the point when it is earned and is measurable, regardless of when cash is received.\\nDual Aspect Concept: This fundamental principle of accounting states that every transaction has a dual effect on the financial position of the business, represented by the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity.\\nConservatism: This convention suggests a degree of caution in the face of uncertainty, typically by recognizing expenses and liabilities as soon as possible when there is uncertainty about the outcome, but only recognizing revenues and assets when they are assured of being received.\\nConsistency: This principle states that once an accounting method has been chosen, it should be used consistently from one period to another to ensure comparability of financial statements over time.\\nMateriality: This concept implies that all significant items, the knowledge of which might influence the decision of a user of the financial statements, should be properly reported.\\nThese concepts and conventions form the bedrock of financial accounting, ensuring that the financial statements present a true and fair view of the financial performance and position of the business.', \"INTRODUCTION\\nLet us imagine a situation where you are a proprietor and you take copies of your books of account to five different accountants. You ask them to prepare the financial statements on the basis of the above records and to calculate the profits of the business for the year. After few days, they are ready with the financial statements and all the five accountants have calculated five different amounts of profits and that too with very wide variations among them. Guess in such a situation what impact would it leave on you about accounting profession. To avoid this, a generally accepted set of rules have been developed. This generally accepted set of rules provides unity of understanding and unity of approach in the practice of accounting and also in better preparation and presentation of the financial statements.\\nAccounting is a language of the business. Financial statements prepared by the accountant communicate financial information to the various stakeholders for decision-making purpose. Therefore, it is important that financial statements prepared by different organizations should\\nbe prepared on uniform basis. Also, there should be consistency over a period of time in the preparation of these financial statements. If every accountant starts following his own norms and notions for accounting of different items, then there will be an utter confusion.\\nTo avoid confusion and to achieve uniformity, accounting process is applied within the conceptual framework of 'Generally Accepted Accounting Principles'(GAAPs). The term GAAPs is used to describe rules developed for the preparation of the financial statements and are called concepts, conventions, postulates, principles etc. These GAAPs are the backbone of the accounting information system, without which the whole system cannot even stand erectly. These principles are the ground rules, which define the parameters and constraints within which accounting reports are generated. Accounting principles are basic norms and assumptions on which the whole accounting system has been developed and established. Accountant also adheres to various accounting standards issued by the regulatory authority for the standardization of accounting policies to be followed under specific circumstances. These conceptual frameworks, GAAPs and accounting standards are considered as the theory base of accounting. Globally, for achieving the standardization, countries use the framework under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, countries may apply their respective GAAPs and related conceptual frameworks. For example, in India, companies are required to use AS or Ind-AS frameworks as applicable.\", 'ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS\\nAccounting concepts define the assumptions on the basis of which financial statements of a business entity are prepared. Certain concepts are perceived, assumed and accepted in accounting to provide a unifying structure and internal logic to accounting process. The word concept means idea or notion, which has universal application. Financial transactions are interpreted in the light of the concepts, which govern accounting methods. Concepts are those basic assumptions and conditions, which form the basis upon which the accountancy has been laid. Unlike physical science, accounting concepts are only result of broad consensus. These accounting concepts lay the foundation on the basis of which the accounting principles are formulated.', 'ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\\t\\n\"Accounting principles are a body of doctrines commonly associated with the theory and procedures of accounting serving as an explanation of current practices and as a guide for selection of conventions or procedures where alternatives exist.\"\\nAccounting principles must satisfy the following conditions:\\nThey should be based on real assumptions;\\nThey must be simple, understandable and explanatory;\\nThey must be followed consistently;\\nThey should be able to reflect future predictions;\\nThey should be informational for the users.', \"ACCOUNTING CONVENTIONS\\nAccounting conventions emerge out of accounting practices, commonly known as accounting principles, adopted by various organizations over a period of time. These conventions are derived by usage and practice. The accountancy bodies of the world may change any of the convention to improve the quality of accounting information. Accounting conventions need not have universal application.\\nIn the study material, the terms 'accounting concepts', 'accounting principles' and 'accounting conventions' have been used interchangeably to mean those basic points of agreement on which financial accounting theory and practice are founded.\", \"CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES AND CONVENTIONS - AN OVERVIEW\\nNow we shall study in detail the various accounting concepts on which accounting is based. The following are the widely accepted accounting concepts:\\nConcepts, Principles Entity concept: \\nEntity concept states that business enterprise is a separate identity apart from its owner. Accountants should treat a business as distinct from its owner. Business transactions are recorded in the business books of accounts and owner's transactions in his personal books of accounts. The practice of distinguishing the affairs of the business from the personal affairs of the owners originated only in the early days of the doubleentry book-keeping. This concept helps in keeping business affairs free from the influence of the personal affairs of the owner. This basic concept is applied to all the organizations whether sole proprietorship or partnership or corporate entities.\\nEntity concept keeps the business separate from its owner. In a way, the entity concept helps to ascertain how much amount of money is due to the owner in form of his capital and share of profits earned. It also helps to perform accounting from the point of view of the business and not that of the owner. For example, if a person runs a business and pays money from his own pocket for his son's school fee, it will not constitute a transaction in the books of the business. However, if the person withdraws\\nmoney from the business to pay for his son's school fee it will constitute a transaction to be recorded in the books of the business as amount withdrawn by the owner.\\nEntity concept means that the enterprise is liable to the owner for capital investment made by the owner. Since the owner invested capital, which is also called risk capital, he has claim on the profit of the enterprise. A portion of profit which is apportioned to the owner and is immediately payable becomes current liability in the case of corporate entities.\", 'Concepts, Principles Money measurement concept: \\nAs per this concept, only those transactions, which can be measuredin terms of money are recorded. Since money is the medium of exchange and the standard of economic value, this concept requires that those transactions alone that are capable of being measured in terms of money be only to be recorded in the books of accounts. Transactions, even if, they affect the results of the business materially, are not recorded if they are not convertible in monetary terms.\\nFor example, a business owning a factory on a piece of 1 acre of land, with an office building with 2 floors, having 20 computers, and 10 units of machine cannot show these items under different measurement units. These items need to be expressed in monetary terms. The factory price might be , cost of land might be , building\\nwith a cost of , computers at a cost of 10 lac and machines with a cost of  need to be recorded.\\nHowever, the concept has its own limitations. Transactions and events that cannot be expressed in terms of money are not recorded in the business books. For example; employees of the organization are, no doubt, the assets of the organizations but their measurement in monetary terms is not possible therefore, not included in the books of account of the organization. Measuring unit for money is taken as the currency of the ruling country i.e., the ruling currency of a country provides a common denomination for the value of material objects.\\nIt may be mentioned that when transactions occur across the boundary of a country, one may see many currencies. Suppose a businessman sells goods worth ₹ 50 lakhs at home and he also sells goods worth of 1 lakh Euro in the United States. What is his total sales? ₹ 50 lakhs plus 1 lakh Euro.\\nThese are not amenable to even arithmetic treatment. So, transactions are to be recorded at uniform monetary unit i.e. in one currency. Suppose EURO 1 = ₹ 71 .\\nTotal Sales  lakhs plus 71 lakhs  lakhs. Money Measurement Concept imparts the essential flexibility for measurement and interpretation of accounting data.\\nThis concept ignores that money is an inelastic yardstick for measurement as it is based on the implicit assumption that purchasing power of the money is not of sufficient importance as to require adjustment. For example, a unit of land purchased 10 years ago for  and a similar unit of land purchased now for  will still be shown at the respective values, i.e., total of . Though in real world, the true value of the units together might be . Accordingly, accounting does not give a true and fair view of the affairs of the business.\\nAs mentioned earlier, many material transactions and events are not recorded in the books of accounts just because they cannot be measured in monetary terms. Yet it is used for accounting purposes because it is not possible to adopt a better measurement scale.\\nEntity and money measurement are viewed as the basic concepts on which other procedural concepts hinge.', \"Concepts, Principles Periodicity concept: \\nThis is also called the concept of definite accounting period. As per going concern' concept an indefinite life of the entity is assumed. For a business entity it causes inconvenience to measure performance achieved by the entity in the ordinary course of business.\\nIf a textile mill lasts for 100 years, it is not desirable to measure its performance as well as financial position only at the end of its life.\\nSo, a small but workable fraction of time is chosen out of infinite life cycle of the business entity for measuring performance and looking at the financial position. Generally, one year period is taken up for performance measurement and appraisal of financial position. However, it may also be 6 months or 9 months or 15 months.\\nAccording to this concept accounts should be prepared after every period & not at the end of the life of the entity. Usually, this period is one calendar year. We generally follow from 1st April of a year to 31st March of the immediately following year.\\nThus, for performance appraisal it is not necessary to look into the revenue and expenses of an unduly long time-frame. This concept makes the accounting system workable and the term 'accrual' meaningful. If one thinks of indefinite time-frame, nothing will accrue. There cannot be unpaid expenses and non- receipt of revenue. Accrued expenses or accrued revenue is only with reference to a finite time-frame which is called accounting period.\\nThus, the periodicity concept facilitates in:\\nComparing of financial statements of different periods\\nUniform and consistent accounting treatment for ascertaining the profit and assets of the business\\nMatching periodic revenues with expenses for getting correct results of the business operations\\nConcepts, Principles Accrual concept: \\nUnder accrual concept, the effects of transactions and other events are recognised on mercantile basis i.e., when they occur (and not as cash or a cash equivalent is received or paid) and they are recorded in the accounting records and reported in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. Financial statements prepared on the accrual basis inform users not only of past events involving the payment and receipt of cash but also of obligations to pay cash in the future and of resources that represent cash to be received in the future.\\nTo understand accrual assumption knowledge of revenues and expenses is required. Revenue is the gross inflow of cash, receivables and other consideration arising in the course of the ordinary activities of an enterprise from sale of goods, from rendering services and from the use by others of enterprise's resources yielding interest, royalties and dividends. For example, (1) Mr. X started a cloth merchandising. He invested , bought merchandise worth ₹ 50,000 . He sold such merchandise for ₹ 60,000 . Customers paid him ₹ 50,000 cash and assure him to pay ₹ 10,000 shortly. His revenue\\nis ₹ 60,000 . It arose in the ordinary course of cloth business; Mr. X received ₹ 50,000 in cash and  by way of receivables.\\nTake another example; (2) an electricity supply undertaking supplies electricity spending ₹  for fuel and wages and collects electricity bill in one month  by way of electricity charges. This is also revenue which arose from rendering services.\\nLastly, (3) Mr. A invested ₹  in a business. He purchased a machine paying ₹ . He rented it for ₹ 20,000 annually to Mr. B. ₹ 20,000 is the revenue of Mr. A; it arose from the use PG the enterprise's resources.\\nExpense is a cost relating to the operations of an accounting period or to the revenue earned during the period or the benefits of which do not extend beyond that period.\\nIn the first example, Mr. X spent ₹ 50,000 to buy the merchandise; it is the expense of generating revenue of . In the second instance  are the expenses. Also whenever any asset is used it has a finite life to generate benefit. Suppose, the machine purchased by Mr. A in the third example will last for 10 years only. Then  is the expense every year relating to the cost of machinery.\\nAccrual means recognition of revenue and costs as they are earned or incurred and not as money is received or paid. The accrual concept relates to measurement of income, identifying assets and liabilities.\\nExample: Mr. J D buys clothing of ₹ 50,000 paying cash  and sells at  of which customers paid only ₹ 50,000.\\nHis revenue is ₹ 60,000 , not  cash received. Expense (i.e., cost incurred for the revenue) is ₹ 50,000 , not ₹ 20,000 cash paid. So the accrual concept based profit is ₹ 10,000 (Revenue - Expenses).\\nAs per Accrual Concept: Revenue - Expenses  Profit\\nAccrual Concept provides the foundation on which the structure of present-day accounting has been developed.\\nAlternative as per Cash basis\\nCash received in ordinary course of business - Cash paid in ordinary course of business  profit.\\nTiming of revenue and expense booking could be different from cash receipt or paid.\\nwhen cash received before revenue - a liability is created when cash is is booked received in advance\\nwhen cash received after revenue is booked\\nwhen cash paid before expense is booked\\nwhen cash paid after expense is booked an asset called Trade receivables is created\\ncreates an asset called Trade Advance when cash is paid in advance\\ncreates a liability called payables or Trade payables or outstanding liabilities\\nConcepts, Principles Matching concept: \\nIn this concept, all expenses matched with the revenue of that period should only be taken into consideration. In the financial statements of the organization if any revenue is recognized then expenses related to earn that revenue should also be recognized.\\nThis concept is based on accrual concept as it considers the occurrence of expenses and income and do not concentrate on actual inflow or outflow of cash. This leads to adjustment of certain items like prepaid and outstanding expenses, unearned or accrued incomes.\\nIt is not necessary that every expense identify every income. Some expenses are directly related to the revenue and some are time bound. For example:- selling expenses are directly related to sales but rent, salaries etc are recorded on accrual basis for a particular accounting period. In other words periodicity concept has also been followed while applying matching concept.\\nMr. P K started cloth business. He purchased 10,000 pcs. garments @ ₹ 100 per piece and sold 8,000 pcs. @ ₹ 150 per piece during the accounting period of 12 months 1st January to  December, 2022. He paid shop rent @ ₹ 3,000 per month for 11 months and paid  to the suppliers of garments and received ₹  from the customers.\\nLet us see how the accrual and periodicity concepts operate.\\nPeriodicity Concept fixes up the time-frame for which the performance is to be measured and financial position is to be appraised. Here, it is January 2022 - December, 2022. Therefore, revenues and expenses are to be measured for the year 2022 and assets and liabilities are to be ascertained as on  December, 2022.\\nAccrual Concept operates to measure revenue of ₹ 12,00,000 (arising out of sale of garments 8,000 Pcs  ₹ 150) which accrued during 2022, not the cash received  and also the expenses correctly. Shop rent for 12 months is an expense item amounting to ₹ 36,000 , not ₹ 33,000 the cash paid.\\nShould the accountant treat  as expenses for purchase of merchandise? And should he treat ₹ 1,64,000 as profit? (Revenue ₹ 12,00,000-Merchandise ₹ 10,00,000. Shop Rent ₹ 36,000). Obviously, the answer is No. Matching links revenue with expenses.\\nRevenue - Expenses  Profit\\nBut this unqualified equation may create misconception.\\nIt should be defined as: Periodic Profit  Periodic Revenue - Matched Expenses\\nFrom the revenue of an accounting period such expenses are deducted which are expended to generate the revenue to determine profit of that period.\\nIn the given example revenue relates to only sale of 8,000 pcs. of garments. Therefore, the cost of 8,000 pcs of garments should be treated as expenses.\\nThus, Profit = Revenue\\nRevenue: ₹12,00,000\\nLess Expenses:\\nMerchandise: ₹8,00,000\\nShop Rent: ₹36,000\\nTotal Expenses: (₹8,36,000)\\nProfit:\\nNet Profit: ₹3,64,000\\nAssets:\\nInventory: (2,000 pcs x ₹100) = ₹2,00,000\\nTrade Receivables: ₹2,00,000\\nCash: (Cash Receipts ₹10,00,000 - Cash Payments ₹8,33,000) = ₹1,67,000\\nTotal Assets: ₹5,67,000\\nLiabilities:\\nTrade Payables: ₹2,00,000\\nExpenses Payables: ₹3,000\\nCapital (Profit): ₹3,64,000\\nTotal Liabilities: ₹5,67,000\\nThus, accrual, matching and periodicity concepts work together for income measurement and recognition of assets and liabilities.\", 'Concepts, Principles Going Concern concept: \\nThe financial statements are normally prepared on the assumption that an enterprise is a going concern and will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Hence, it is assumed that the enterprise has neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or curtail materially the scale of its operations; if such an\\nintention or need exists, the financial statements may have to be prepared on a different basis and, if so, the basis used needs to be disclosed.\\nThe valuation of assets of a business entity is dependent on this assumption. Traditionally, accountants follow historical cost in majority of the cases.\\nSuppose Mr. X purchased a machine for his business paying  out of  invested by him. He also paid transportation expenses and installation charges amounting to . If he is still willing to continue the business, his financial position will be as follows:\\nBALANCE SHEET\\nThis balance sheet shows that the entity has a total of ₹7,00,000 in capital, which matches the total value of assets. The assets are composed of machinery worth ₹5,70,000 and cash amounting to ₹1,30,000. The total liabilities equal the total assets, ensuring that the balance sheet is balanced.\\nNow if he decides to back out and desires to sell the machine, it may fetch more than or less than . So his financial position should be different. If going concern concept is taken, increase/ decrease in the value of assets in the short-run is ignored. The concept indicates that assets are kept for generating benefit in future, not for immediate sale; current change in the asset value is not realisable and so it should not be counted.\\nThis can be understood differently with some examples we may have come across in real life. Recently during pandemic, many businesses were shutting down due to heavy losses. If the financial statement of these entities does not reveal the fact of winding up due to losses, it will mislead the stakeholders. And, a sudden news of the business shutting down would be a setback to those stakeholders.\\nTherefore, entities need to assess at the time of preparation of financial statements, whether they are likely to continue to operate their business. If the Going Concern assumption is under question, the same information should be communicated to the stakeholders.', 'Concepts, Principles Cost concept: \\nBy this concept, the value of an asset is to be determined on the basis of historical cost, in other words, acquisition cost. Although there are various measurement bases, accountants traditionally prefer this concept in the interests of objectivity. When a machine is acquired by paying ₹ , following cost concept the value of the machine is taken as ₹ 5,00,000. It is highly objective and free from all bias. Other measurement bases are not so objective. Current cost of an asset is not easily determinable. If the asset is purchased on 1.1.1995 and such model is not available in\\nthe market, it becomes difficult to determine which model is the appropriate equivalent to the existing one. Similarly, unless the machine is actually sold, realisable value will give only a hypothetical figure. Lastly, present value base is highly subjective because to know the value of the asset one has to chase the uncertain future.\\nHowever, the cost concept creates a lot of distortion too as outlined below:\\nIn an inflationary situation when prices of all commodities go up on an average, acquisition cost loses its relevance. For example, a piece of land purchased on 1.1.1995 for ₹ 2,000 may cost ₹  as on 1.1.2022. So if the accountant makes valuation of asset at historical cost, the accounts will not reflect the true position.\\nHistorical cost-based accounts may lose comparability. Mr. X invested ₹ 1,00,000 in a machine on 1.1.1995 which produces ₹ 50,000 cash inflow during the year 2022, while Mr. Y invested ₹ 5,00,000 in a machine on 1.1.2005 which produced  cash inflows during the year. Mr. X earned at the rate  while Mr. Y earned at the rate . Who is more efficient? Since the assets are recorded at the historical cost, the results are not comparable. Obviously, it is a corollary to (a).\\nMany assets do not have acquisition costs. Human assets of an enterprise are an example. The cost concept fails to recognise such asset although it is a very important asset of any organization.\\nMany other controversial issues have arisen in financial accounting that revolves around the cost concept which will be discussed at the advanced stage. However, later on we shall see that in many circumstances, the cost convention is not followed. See conservatism concept for an example, which will be discussed later on in this unit.', 'Concepts, Principles Realization concept: \\nIt closely follows the cost concept. Any change in value of an asset is to be recorded only when the business realises it. When an asset is recorded at its historical cost of  and even if its current cost is  such change is not counted unless there is certainty that such change will materialize.\\nHowever, accountants follow a more conservative path. They try to cover all probable losses but do not count any probable gain. That is to say, if accountants anticipate decrease in value they count it, but if there is increase in value they ignore it until it is realized. Economists are highly critical about the realisation concept. According to them, this concept creates value distortion and makes accounting meaningless.\\nThus, the going concern, cost concept and realization concept gives the valuation criteria.\\nDual aspect concept: This concept is the core of double entry book-keeping. Every transaction or event has two aspects:\\nIt increases one Asset and decreases other Asset;\\nIt increases an Asset and simultaneously increases Liability;\\nIt decreases one Asset, increases another Asset;\\nIt decreases one Asset, decreases a Liability.\\nAlternatively:\\nIt increases one Liability, decreases other Liability;\\nIt increases a Liability, increases an Asset;\\nIt decreases Liability, increases other Liability;\\nIt decreases Liability, decreases an Asset.', \"Concepts, Principles Conservatism: \\nConservatism states that the accountant should not anticipate any future income however they should provide for all possible losses. When there are many alternative values of an asset, an accountant should choose the method which leads to the lesser value. Later on, we shall see that the golden rule of current assets valuation - 'cost or market price whichever is lower' originated from this concept.\\nThe Realisation Concept also states that no change should be counted unless it has materialised. The Conservatism Concept puts a further brake on it. It is not prudent to count unrealised gain but it is desirable to guard against all possible losses.\\nFor this concept there should be at least three qualitative characteristics of financial statements, namely,\\nPrudence, i.e., judgement about the possible future losses which are to be guarded, as well as gains which are uncertain.\\nNeutrality, i.e., unbiased outlook is required to identify and record such possible losses, as well as to exclude uncertain gains,\\nFaithful representation of alternative values.\\nThis concept is of wider importance to investors since they would need to take a decision about their money being invested in the business. Recording future profits when these have not been earned would suggest that the business is booming, and the investors would be tempted to put more money into the same. However, eventually if the profit is not earned, the investors are likely to loose their investments. At the same time, if the entity expects to make a loss in future, it is prudent to show that loss in the books in present itself. This acts as a safeguard for the investors as they would be prudent to make the investment decisions. For example: Mr.  runs a business of computers. He purchased 10 computers at a cost of  each and is expecting to be able to sell these computers at the current market price of ₹ 25,000 each. Note that the conservatism principle does not allow to recognise the profit on the computers unless the sale has been made. Since, this is a future profit, Mr. X needs to follow a prudent approach while recording the transactions in his books and ignore the profit until it is earned\\nHowever, before sale, the market price of the computers declines to ₹ 17,000 each. Under the conservatism approach, Mr. X needs to recognise that loss of  per computer, even though the sale has not been made.\\nMany accounting authors, however, are of the view that conservatism essentially leads to understatement of income and wealth and it should not be the basis for the preparation of financial statements.\", \"Concepts, Principles Consistency: \\nIn order to achieve comparability of the financial statements of an enterprise through time, the accounting policies are followed consistently from one period to another; a change in an accounting policy is made only in certain exceptional circumstances.\\nThe concept of consistency is applied particularly when alternative methods of accounting are equally acceptable. For example, a company may adopt any of several methods of depreciation such as written-down-value method, straight-line method, etc. Likewise, there are many methods for valuation of inventories. But following the principle of consistency it is advisable that the company should follow consistently\\nover years the same method of depreciation or the same method of valuation of Inventories which is chosen. However, in some cases though there is no inconsistency, they may seem to be inconsistent apparently. In case of valuation of Inventories if the company applies the principle 'at cost or market price whichever is lower' and if this principle accordingly results in the valuation of Inventories in one year at cost price and the market price in the other year, there is no inconsistency here. It is only an application of the principle.\\nBut the concept of consistency does not imply non-flexibility as not to allow the introduction of improved method of accounting.\\nAn enterprise should change its accounting policy in any of the following circumstances only:\\nTo bring the books of accounts in accordance with the issued Accounting Standards.\\nTo comply with the provision of law.\\nWhen under changed circumstances, it is felt that new method will reflect a true and fair picture in the financial statement.\", \"Concepts, Principles Materiality: \\nMateriality principle permits other concepts to be ignored, if the effect is not considered material. This principle is an exception to full disclosure principle. According to materiality principle, all the items having significant economic effect on the business of the enterprise should be disclosed in the financial statements and any insignificant item which will only increase the work of the accountant but will not be relevant to the users' need should not be disclosed in the financial statements.\\nThe term materiality is the subjective term. It is on the judgement, common sense and discretion of the accountant that which item is material and which is not. For example, stationary purchased by the organization though not used fully in the accounting year purchased still shown as an expense of that year because of the materiality concept. Similarly, depreciation on small items like books, calculators etc. is taken as  in the year of purchase though used by the entity for more than a year. This is because the amount for books or calculator is very small to be shown in the balance sheet though it is the asset of the company.\\nThe materiality depends not only upon the amount of the item but also upon the size of the business, nature and level of information, level of the person making the decision etc. Moreover, an item material to one person may be immaterial to another person. What is important is that omission of any information should not impair the decision-making of various users.\", 'FUNDAMENTAL ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS\\nThere are three fundamental accounting assumptions:\\nGoing Concern\\nConsistency\\nAccrual\\nAll the above three fundamental accounting assumptions have already been explained in para 2.5.\\nIf nothing has been written about the fundamental accounting assumption in the financial statements then it is assumed that they have already been followed in their preparation of financial statements. However, if any of the above-mentioned fundamental accounting assumption is not followed then this fact should be specifically disclosed.', \"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nThe aim of accounting is to keep systematic records to ascertain financial performance and financial position of an entity and to communicate the relevant financial information to the interested user groups. The financial statements are basic means through which the management of an entity makes public communication of the financial information along with selected quantitative details. They are structured financial representations of the financial position and the performance of an enterprise. To have a record of all business transactions and also to determine whether all these transactions resulted in either 'profit or loss' for the period, all the entities will prepare financial statements viz., balance sheet, profit and loss account, cash flow statement etc. by following various accounting concepts, principles, and conventions which have been already discussed in detail.\", 'Qualitative Characteristics of financial Statements\\nQualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information provided in financial statements useful to users. The following are the important qualitative characteristics of the financial statements:\\nUnderstandability: An essential quality of the information provided in financial statements is that it must be readily understandable by users. For this purpose, it is assumed that users have a reasonable knowledge of business, economic activities and accounting and study the information with reasonable diligence. Information about complex matters that should be included in the financial statements because of its relevance to the economic decision-making needs of users should not be excluded merely on the ground that it may be too difficult for certain users to understand.\\nRelevance: To be useful, information must be relevant to the decision-making needs of users. Information has the quality of relevance when it influences the economic decisions of users by helping them evaluate past, present or future events or confirming, or correcting, their past evaluations.\\nReliability: To be useful, information must also be reliable, Information has the quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be depended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.\\nComparability: Users must be able to compare the financial statements of an enterprise through time in order to identify trends in its financial position, performance and cash flows. Users must also be able to compare the financial statements of different enterprises in order to evaluate their relative financial position, performance and cash flows. Hence, the measurement and display of the financial effects of like transactions and other events must be carried out in a consistent way throughout an enterprise and over time for that enterprise and in a consistent way for different enterprises.\\nMateriality: The relevance of information is affected by its materiality. Information is material if its misstatement (i.e., omission or erroneous statement) could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial information. Materiality depends on the size and nature of the item or error, judged in the particular circumstances of its misstatement. Materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point rather than being a primary qualitative characteristic which the information must have if it is to be useful.\\nFaithful Representation: To be reliable, information must represent faithfully the transactions and other events it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. Thus, for example, a balance sheet should represent faithfully the transactions and other events that result in assets, liabilities and equity of the enterprise at the reporting date which meet the recognition criteria.\\nSubstance over Form: If information is to represent faithfully the transactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality and not merely their legal form. The substance of transactions or other events is not always consistent with that which is apparent from their legal or contrived form. For example, where rights and beneficial interest in an immovable property are transferred but the documentations and legal formalities are pending, the recording of acquisition/disposal (by the transferee and transferor respectively) would in substance represent the transaction entered into.\\nNeutrality: To be reliable, the information contained in financial statements must be neutral, that is, free from bias. Financial statements are not neutral if, by the selection or presentation of information, they influence the making of a decision or judgement in order to achieve a predetermined result or outcome.\\nPrudence: The preparers of financial statements have to contend with the uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the collectability of receivables, the probable useful life of plant and machinery, and the warranty claims that may occur. Such uncertainties are recognised by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by the exercise of prudence in the preparation of the financial statements. Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of the judgments needed in making the estimates required under conditions of uncertainty, such that assets or income are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not understated. However, the exercise of prudence does not allow, for example, the creation of hidden reserves or excessive provisions, the deliberate understatement of assets or income, or the deliberate overstatement of liabilities or expenses, because the financial statements would then not be neutral and, therefore, not have the quality of reliability.\\nFull, fair and adequate disclosure: The financial statement must disclose all the reliable and relevant information about the business enterprise to the management and also to their external users for which they are meant, which in turn will help them to take a reasonable and rational decision. For it, it is necessary that financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles i.e the information is accounted for and presented in accordance with its substance and economic reality and not merely with its legal form. The disclosure should be full and final so that users can correctly assess the financial position of the enterprise.\\nCompleteness: To be reliable, the information in financial statements must be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost. An omission can cause information to be false or misleading and thus unreliable and deficient in terms of its relevance.', 'Qualitative Characteristics of financial Statements\\nQualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information provided in financial statements useful to users. The following are the important qualitative characteristics of the financial statements:\\nFinancial Statements of Understandability: An essential quality of the information provided in financial statements is that it must be readily understandable by users. For this purpose, it is assumed that users have a reasonable knowledge of business, economic activities and accounting and study the information with reasonable diligence. Information about complex matters that should be included in the financial statements because of its relevance to the economic decision-making needs of users should not be excluded merely on the ground that it may be too difficult for certain users to understand.', 'Financial Statements of Relevance: To be useful, information must be relevant to the decision-making needs of users. Information has the quality of relevance when it influences the economic decisions of users by helping them evaluate past, present or future events or confirming, or correcting, their past evaluations.\\nThe predictive and confirmatory roles of information are interrelated. For example, information about the current level and structure of asset holdings has value to users when they endeavour to predict the ability of the enterprise to take advantage of opportunities and its ability to react to adverse situations. The same information plays a confirmatory role in respect of past predictions about, for example, the way in which the enterprise would be structured or the outcome of planned operations.\\nInformation about financial position and past performance is frequently used as the basis for predicting future financial position and performance and other matters in which users are directly interested, such as dividend and wage payments, share price movements and the ability of the enterprise to meet its commitments as they fall due. To have predictive value, information need not be in the form of an explicit forecast. The ability to make predictions from financial statements is enhanced, however, by the manner in which information on past transactions and events is displayed. For example, the predictive value of the statement of profit and loss is enhanced if unusual, abnormal and infrequent items of income and expense are separately disclosed.', 'Financial Statements of Reliability: To be useful, information must also be reliable, Information has the quality of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be depended upon by users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.\\nInformation may be relevant but so unreliable in nature or representation that its recognition may be potentially misleading. For example, if the validity and amount of a claim for damages under a legal action against the enterprise are highly uncertain, it may be inappropriate for the enterprise to recognise the amount of the claim in the balance sheet, although it may be appropriate to disclose the amount and circumstances of the claim.', 'Financial Statements of Comparability: Users must be able to compare the financial statements of an enterprise through time in order to identify trends in its financial position, performance and cash flows. Users must also be able to compare the financial statements of different enterprises in order to evaluate their relative financial position, performance and cash flows. Hence, the measurement and display of the financial effects of like transactions and other events must be carried out in a consistent way throughout an enterprise and over time for that enterprise and in a consistent way for different enterprises.\\nAn important implication of the qualitative characteristic of comparability is that users be informed of the accounting policies employed in the preparation of the financial statements, any changes in those polices and the effects of such changes. Users need to be able to identify differences between the accounting policies for like transactions and other events used by the same enterprise from period to period and by different enterprises. Compliance with Accounting Standards, including the disclosure of the accounting policies used by the enterprise, helps to achieve comparability.\\nThe need for comparability should not be confused with mere uniformity and should not be allowed to become an impediment to the introduction of improved accounting standards. It is not appropriate for an enterprise to continue accounting in the same manner for a transaction or other event if the policy adopted is not in keeping with the qualitative characteristics of relevance and reliability. It is also inappropriate for an enterprise to leave its accounting policies unchanged when more relevant and reliable alternatives exist.\\nUsers wish to compare the financial position, performance and cash flows of an enterprise over time. Hence, it is important that the financial statements show corresponding information for the preceding period(s).\\nThe four principal qualitative characteristics are understandability, relevance,reliability and comparability.', 'Financial Statements of Materiality: The relevance of information is affected by its materiality. Information is material if its misstatement (i.e., omission or erroneous statement) could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial information. Materiality depends on the size and nature of the item or error, judged in the particular circumstances of its misstatement.

Thus, for example, a balance sheet should represent faithfully the transactions and other events that result in assets, liabilities and equity of the enterprise at the reporting date which meet the recognition criteria.\\nMost financial information is subject to some risk of being less than a faithful representation of that which it purports to portray. This is not due to bias, but rather to inherent difficulties either in identifying the transactions and other events to be measured or in devising and applying measurement and presentation techniques that can convey messages that correspond with those transactions and events. In certain\\ncases, the measurement of the financial effects of items could be so uncertain that enterprises generally would not recognise them in the financial statements; for example, although most enterprises generate goodwill internally over time, it is usually difficult to identify or measure that goodwill reliably. In other cases, however, it may be relevant to recognise items and to disclose the risk of error surrounding their recognition and measurement.', 'Financial Statements of Substance over Form: If information is to represent faithfully the transactions and other events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality and not merely their legal form.

The Companies Act in pursuant of this principle came out with the format of balance sheet and profit and loss account. The disclosures of all the major accounting policies and other information are to be provided in the form of footnotes, annexures etc. The practice of appending notes to the financial statements is the outcome of this principle.', 'Financial Statements of Completeness: To be reliable, the information in financial statements must be complete within the bounds of materiality and cost.

For example, if a business enterprise sells its assets to others but still uses the assets as usual for the purpose of the business by making some arrangement with the seller, it simply becomes a legal transaction. The economic reality is that the business is using the assets as usual for deriving the benefit. Financial statement information should contain the substance of this transaction and should not only record going by legality. In order to be reliable, the financial statements information should be neutral i.e., free from bias. The prepares of financial statements however, have to contend with the uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the collectability of doubtful receivables, the probable useful life of plant and equipment and the number of warranty claims that many occur. Such uncertainties are recognised by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by exercise of prudence in the preparation of financial statements.

      "('CA-FO-P1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1-U7-Accounting Standards', [\"INTRODUCTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nAccounting as a 'language of business' communicates the financial results of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. If the financial accounting process is not properly regulated, there is possibility of financial statements being misleading, tendentious and providing a distorted picture of the business, rather than the true. To ensure transparency, consistency, comparability, adequacy and reliability of financial reporting, it is essential to standardize the accounting principles and policies. Accounting Standards (ASs) provide framework and standard accounting policies for treatment of transactions and events so that the financial statements of different enterprises become comparable.\\nAccounting standards are written policy documents issued by the expert accounting body or by the government or other regulatory body covering the aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of accounting transactions and events in the financial statements. The ostensible purpose of the standard setting bodies is to promote the dissemination of timely and useful financial information to investors and certain other parties having an interest in the company's economic performance. The accounting standards deal with the issues of -\\nrecognition of events and transactions in the financial statements;\\nmeasurement of these transactions and events;\\npresentation of these transactions and events in the financial statements in a manner that is meaningful and understandable to the reader; and\\nthe disclosure requirements which should be there to enable the public at large and the stakeholders and the potential investors in particular, to get an insight into what these financial statements are trying to reflect and thereby facilitating them to take prudent and informed business decisions.\", 'OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nThe whole idea of accounting standards is centered around harmonisation of accounting policies and practices followed by different business entities so that the diverse accounting practices adopted for various aspects of accounting can be standardised. Accounting Standards standardise diverse accounting policies with a view to:\\neliminate the non-comparability of financial statements and thereby improving the reliability of financial statements; and\\nprovide a set of standard accounting policies, valuation norms and disclosure requirements.\\nAccounting standards reduce the accounting alternatives in the preparation of financial statements within the bounds of rationality, thereby ensuring comparability of financial statements of different enterprises.', 'BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nAccounting standards seek to describe the accounting principles, the valuation techniques and the methods of applying the accounting principles in the preparation and presentation of financial statements so that they may give a true and fair view. By setting the accounting standards, the accountant has following benefits:\\nStandards reduce to a reasonable extent or eliminate altogether confusing variations in the accounting treatments used to prepare financial statements.\\nThere are certain areas where important information are not statutorily required to be disclosed. Standards may call for disclosure beyond that required by law.\\nThe application of accounting standards would, to a limited extent, facilitate comparison of financial statements of companies situated in different parts of the world and also of different companies situated in the same country. However, it should be noted in this respect that differences in the institutions, traditions and legal systems from one country to another give rise to differences in accounting standards adopted in different countries.\\nBenefits of Accounting Standards\\nAccounting standards provide several key advantages that are crucial for the uniformity and transparency of financial reporting:\\nStandardisation of Alternative Accounting Treatments: Accounting standards mitigate inconsistencies by standardizing various methods available for accounting treatments. This eliminates the discrepancies that can arise when different practices are applied to similar transactions.\\nRequirements for Additional Disclosures: They necessitate comprehensive disclosures that give users of financial statements a more complete understanding of the financial information presented. These disclosures are integral to ensuring that all relevant financial data is communicated effectively.\\nComparability of Financial Statements: One of the most significant benefits of accounting standards is the comparability they afford. By providing a consistent framework for financial reporting, these standards make it possible to compare financial statements across different periods and entities, enhancing the decision-making process for investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.\\nHowever, there are some limitations of accounting standards:\\nDifficulties in making choice between different treatments: Alternative solutions to certain accounting problems may each have arguments to recommend them. Therefore, the choice between different alternative accounting treatments may become difficult.\\nRestricted scope: Accounting standards cannot override the statute. The standards are required to be framed within the ambit of prevailing statutes.', 'PROCESS OF FORMULATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN INDIA\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), being a premier accounting body in the country, took upon itself the leadership role by constituting the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in 1977. The ICAI has taken significant initiatives in the setting and issuing procedure of Accounting Standards to ensure that the standard-setting process is fully consultative and transparent. The ASB considers International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) while framing Indian Accounting Standards (ASs) in India and try to integrate them, in the light of the applicable laws, customs, usages and business environment in the country. The composition of ASB includes, representatives of industries (namely, ASSOCHAM, CII, FICCI), regulators, academicians, government departments etc. Although ASB is a body constituted by the Council of the ICAI, it (ASB) is independent in the formulation of accounting standards and Council of the ICAI is not empowered to make any modifications in the draft accounting standards formulated by ASB without consulting with the ASB.\\nThe standard-setting procedure of Accounting Standards Board (ASB) can be briefly outlined as follows:\\nIdentification of broad areas by ASB for formulation of AS.\\nConstitution of study groups by ASB to consider specific projects and to prepare preliminary drafts of the proposed accounting standards. The draft normally includes objective and scope of the standard, definitions of the terms used in the standard, recognition and measurement principles wherever applicable and presentation and disclosure requirements.\\nConsideration of the preliminary draft prepared by the study group of ASB and revision, if any, of the draft on the basis of deliberations.\\nCirculation of draft of accounting standard (after revision by ASB) to the Council members of the ICAI and specified outside bodies such as Department of Company Affairs (DCA), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C&AG), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE), etc. for comments.\\nMeeting with the representatives of the specified outside bodies to ascertain their views on the draft of the proposed accounting standard.\\nFinalisation of the exposure draft of the proposed accounting standard and its issuance inviting public comments.\\nConsideration of comments received on the exposure draft and finalisation of the draft accounting standard by the ASB for submission to the Council of the ICAI for its consideration and approval for issuance.\\nConsideration of the final draft of the proposed standard and by the Council of the ICAI, and if found necessary, modification of the draft in consultation with the ASB is done.\\nThe accounting standard on the relevant subject (for non-corporate entities) is then issued by the ICAI. For corporate entities the accounting standards are issued by The Central Government of India.', \"LIST OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN INDIA\\nThe 'Accounting Standards' issued by the Accounting Standards Board establish standards which have to be complied by the business entities so that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\\nFollowing is the list of applicable Accounting Standards:\\nList of Accounting Standards\\nAS 1 detail the Disclosure of Accounting Policies.\\nAS 2 (Revised) pertains to the Valuation of Inventories.\\nAS 3 (Revised) is about Cash Flow Statements.\\nAS 4 (Revised) addresses Contingencies and Events Occurring after the Balance Sheet Date.\\nAS 5 (Revised) covers Net Profit or Loss for the Period, Prior Period Items, and Changes in Accounting Policies.\\nAS 7 (Revised) relates to Accounting for Construction Contracts.\\nAS 9 deals with Revenue Recognition.\\nAS 10 concerns Property, Plant and Equipment.\\nAS 11 (Revised) explains The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.\\nAS 12 involves Accounting for Government Grants.\\nAS 13 is related to Accounting for Investments.\\nAS 14 discusses Accounting for Amalgamations.\\nAS 15 (Revised) elaborates on Employee Benefits.\\nAS 16 is about Borrowing Costs.\\nAS 17 covers Segment Reporting.\\nAS 18 is concerned with Related Party Disclosures.\\nAS 19 pertains to Leases.\\nAS 20 deals with Earnings Per Share.\\nAS 21 involves Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAS 22 is related to Accounting for Taxes on Income.\\nAS 23 concerns Accounting for Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAS 24 addresses Discontinuing Operations.\\nAS 25 elaborates on Interim Financial Reporting.\\nAS 26 is about Intangible Assets.\\nAS 27 covers Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures.\\nAS 28 discusses Impairment of Assets.\\nAS 29 pertains to Provisions, Contingent Liabilities & Contingent Assets. \\u200b\\u200b\", 'Indian Accounting Standards (IND AS)\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) being the accounting standards-setting body in India, way back in 2006, initiated the process of moving towards the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) with a view to enhance acceptability and transparency of the financial information communicated by the Indian corporates through their financial statements. This move towards IFRS was subsequently accepted by the Government of India. The Government of India in consultation with the ICAI decided to converge and not to adopt IFRSs issued by the IASB. The decision of convergence rather than adoption was taken after the detailed analysis of IFRS requirements and extensive discussion with various stakeholders. Accordingly, while formulating IFRS- converged Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), efforts have been made to keep these Standards, as far as possible, in line with the corresponding IFRS and departures have been made where considered absolutely essential.

      "('CA-FO-P1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1', 'CA-FO-P1-C1-U5-Accounting Policies', ['MEANING OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nAccounting Policies refer to specific accounting principles and methods of applying these principles adopted by the enterprise in the preparation and presentation of financial statements. Policies are based on various accounting concepts, principles and conventions that have already been explained in Unit 2 of Chapter 1. There is no single list of accounting policies, which are applicable to all enterprises in all circumstances. Enterprises operate in diverse and complex environmental situations and so they have to adopt various policies. The choice of specific accounting policy appropriate to the specific circumstances in which the enterprise is operating, calls for considerate judgement by the management. ICAI has been trying to reduce the number of acceptable accounting policies through Guidance Notes and Accounting Standards in its combined efforts with the government, other regulatory agencies and progressive managements. Already it has achieved some progress in this respect.\\nThe areas wherein different accounting policies are frequently encountered can be given as follows:\\nValuation of Inventories;\\nValuation of Investments.\\nThis list should not be taken as exhaustive but is only illustrative. As the course will progress, students will see the intricacies of the various accounting policies.\\nSuppose an enterprise holds some investments in the form of shares of a company at the end of an accounting period. For valuation of shares, the enterprise may adopt FIFO, average method etc. The method selected by that enterprise for valuation is called an accounting policy.', 'SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nChoice of accounting policy is an important policy decision which affects the performance measurement as well as financial position of the business entity. Selection of inappropriate accounting policy may lead to understatement or overstatement of performance and financial position. Thus, accounting policy should be selected with due care after considering its effect on the financial performance of the business enterprise from the angle of various users of accounts.\\nIt is believed that no unified and exhaustive list of accounting policies can be suggested which has universal application. Three major characteristics which should be considered for the purpose of selection and application of accounting policies. viz., Prudence, Substance over form, and Materiality. The financial statements should be prepared on the basis of such accounting policies, which exhibit true and fair view of state of affairs of Balance Sheet and the Profit & Loss Account.\\nExamples wherein selection from a set of accounting policies is made, can be given as follows:-\\nInventories are valued at cost except for finished goods and by-products. Finished goods are valued at lower of cost or market value and by-products are valued at net realizable value.\\nInvestments (long term) are valued at their acquisition cost. Provision for permanent diminution in value has been made wherever necessary.\\nSometimes a wrong or inappropriate treatment is adopted for items in Balance Sheet, or Profit & Loss Account, or other statement. Disclosure of the treatment adopted is necessary in any case, but disclosure cannot rectify a wrong or inappropriate treatment.', 'CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nA change in accounting policies should be made in the following conditions:\\nIt is required by some statute or for compliance with an Accounting Standard\\nChange would result in more appropriate presentation of financial statement\\nChange in accounting policy may have a material effect on the items of financial statements. For example, if cost formula used for inventory valuation is changed from weighted average to FIFO, or if interest is capitalized which was earlier not in practice, or if proportionate amount of interest is changed to inventory which was earlier not the practice, all these may increase or decrease the net profit. Unless the effect of such change in accounting policy is quantified, the financial statements may not help the users of accounts. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the effect of change on financial statement items like assets, liabilities, profit/loss.\\nFor example, Omega Enterprises revised its accounting policy relating to valuation of inventories to include applicable production overheads. It intends to do as it believes that such change would result in a more appropriate presentation of its financial statements.'])\n"

       " ['MEANING OF MEASUREMENT\\nMeasurement is vital aspect of accounting. Primarily transactions and events are measured in terms of money. Any measurement discipline deals with three basic elements of measurement viz., identification of objects and events to be measured, selection of standard or scale to be used, and evaluation of dimension of measurement standards or scale.\\nProf. R. J. Chambers defined \\'measurement\\' as \"assignment of numbers to objects and events according to rules specifying the property to be measured, the scale to be used and the dimension of the unit\". (R.J. Chambers, Accounting Evaluation and Economic Behaviour, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 1966, P.10).\\nKohler defined measurement as the assignment of a system of ordinal or cardinal numbers to the results of a scheme of inquiry or apparatus of observations in accordance with logical or mathematical rules - [A Dictionary of Accountant].\\nOrdinal numbers, or ordinals, are numbers used to denote the position in an ordered sequence: first, second, third, fourth, etc., whereas a cardinal number says \\'how many there are\\': one, two, three, four, etc.\\nChambers\\' definition has been widely used to judge how far accounting can be treated as a measurement discipline.\\nAccording to this definition, the three elements of measurement are:\\nIdentification of objects and events to be measured;\\nSelection of standard or scale to be used;\\nEvaluation of dimension of measurement standard or scale.',\n",
       "  \"OBJECTS OR EVENTS TO BE MEASURED\\nWe have earlier defined Accounting as the process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decisions by the users of the information. So accounting essentially includes measurement of 'information'.\\nDecision makers need past, present and future information. For external users, generally the past information is communicated.\\nThere is no uniform set of events and transactions in accounting which are required for decision making. For example, in cash management, various cash receipts and expenses are the necessary objects and events. Obviously, the decision makers need past cash receipts and expenses data along with projected receipts and expenses. For giving loan to a business one needs information regarding the repayment ability (popularly called debt servicing) of principal and interest. This also includes past information, current state of affairs as well as future projections. It may be mentioned that past and present objects and events can be measured with some degree of accuracy but future events and objects are only predicted, not measured. Prediction is an essential part of accounting information. Decision makers have to take decisions about the unseen future for which they need suitable information.\",\n",
       "  'STANDARD OR SCALE OF MEASUREMENT\\nIn accounting, money is the scale of measurement (see money measurement concept), although now-a- days quantitative information is also communicated along with monetary information.\\nMoney as a measurement scale has no universal denomination. It takes the shape of currency ruling in a country. For example, in India the scale of measurement is Rupee, in the U.K. Pound Sterling (  ), in Germany Deutschmark (DM), in the United States Dollar ($) and so on. Also there is no constant exchange relationship among the currencies.\\nIf one businessman in India took loan  from a businessman of the U.S.A., he would enter the transaction in his books in terms of ₹ Suppose at the time of loan agreement exchange rate was US . Then loan amounted to ₹ . Afterwards the exchange rate has been changed to . At the changed exchange rate the loan amount becomes₹ . So money as a unit of measurement lacks universal applicability across the boundary of a country unless a common currency is in vogue. Since the rate of exchange fluctuates between two currencies over the time, money as a measurement scale also becomes volatile.',\n",
       "  'DIMENSION OF MEASUREMENT SCALE\\nAn ideal measurement scale should be stable over time. For example, if one buys . cabbage today, the quantity he receives will be the same if he will buy . cabbage one year later. Similarly, length of 1 metre cloth will not change if it is bought a few days later. That is to say a measurement scale should be stable in dimension. Money as a scale of measurement is not stable. There occurs continuous change in the input output prices. The same quantity of money may not have the ability to buy same quantity of identical goods at different dates. Thus information of one year measured in money terms may not be comparable with that of another year. Suppose production and sales of a company in two different years are as follows:\\nIn Year 1, 5,000 pieces were valued at ₹5,00,000, while in Year 2, 4,500 pieces were valued at ₹5,40,000\\nLooking at the monetary figures one may be glad for  sales growth. In fact there was  production and sales decline. The growth envisaged through monetary figures is only due to price change. Let us suppose further that the cost of production for the above mentioned two years is as follows:\\nIn Year 1, the quantity was 5,000 pieces valued at ₹4,00,000; in Year 2, it was 4,500 pieces valued at ₹4,50,000.\\nTake Gross profit  Sales - Cost of Production. Then in the first year profit was ₹ 1,00,000 while in the second year the profit was ₹ 90,000 . There was  decline in gross profit.\\nSo, money as a unit of measurement is not stable in the dimension.\\nThus, Accounting measures information mostly in money terms which is not a stable scale having universal applicability and also not stable in dimension for comparison over the time. So it is not an exact measurement discipline.',\n",
       "  \"ACCOUNTING AS A MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE\\nHow do you measure a transaction or an event? Unless the measurement base is settled we cannot progress to the record keeping function of book-keeping. It has been explained that accounting is meant for generating information suitable for users' judgments and decisions. But generation of such information is preceded by recording, classifying and summarising data. By that process it measures performance of the business entity by way of profit or loss and shows its financial position. Thus, measurement is an important part of accounting discipline. But a set of theorems governs the whole measurement sub- system. These theorems should be carefully understood to know how the cogs of the 'accounting-wheel' work. Now-a-days accounting profession earmarked three theorems namely going concern, consistency and accrual as fundamental accounting assumptions, i.e., these assumptions are taken for granted. Also while measuring, classifying, summarising and also presenting, various policies are adopted. Recording, classifying summarising and communication of information are also important part of accounting, which do not fall within the purview of measurement discipline. Therefore, we cannot simply say that accounting is a measurement discipline.\\nBut in accounting money is the unit of measurement. So, let us take one thing for granted that all transactions and events are to be recorded in terms of money only. Quantitative information is also required in many cases but such information is only supplementary to monetary information.\",\n",
       "  'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are:\\nHistorical Cost;\\nCurrent Cost:\\nRealizable Value;\\nPresent Value.\\nLet us discuss these principles in detail.\\nValuation Principles of Historical Cost: \\nIt means acquisition price. For example, the businessman paid  to purchase the machine and spend  on its installation, its acquisition price including installation charges is . The historical cost of machine would be ₹8,00,000.\\nAccording to this base, assets are recorded at an amount of cash or cash equivalent paid at the time of acquisition. Liabilities are recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business.\\nValuation Principles of Current Cost: \\nTake that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 at . As per historical cost base he has to record it at  i.e. the acquisition price. As on 1.1.2022, Mr. X found that it would cost ₹  to purchase that machine. Take also that Mr. X took loan from a bank as on 1.1.2011 ₹ 5,00,000 @ 18% p.a. repayable at the end of 15 th year together with interest. As on 1.1.2022 the bank announces  prepayment penalty on the loan amount if it is paid within 15 days starting from that day. As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000.\\nValuation Principles of Realisable Value: \\nSuppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently. Take also that Mr. X found that he had no money to pay off the bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 currently.\\nValuation Principles of Present Value: \\nSuppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference. Now think the machine purchased by Mr. X can work for another 10 years and is supposed to generate cash @ ₹ 1,00,000 p.a. Also take that bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 taken by Mr.  is to be repaid as on 31.12.2028. Annual interest is .',\n",
       "  'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are:\\nHistorical Cost;\\nCurrent Cost:\\nRealizable Value;\\nPresent Value.\\nLet us discuss these principles in detail.',\n",

In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business.\\nWhen a businessman, takes ₹ 5,00,000 loan from a bank @ 10% interest p.a., it is to be recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. Here the obligation is the repayment of loan as well as payment of interest at an agreed rate i.e. . Proceeds received are  - it is historical cost of the transactions.\\nTake another case regarding payment of income tax liability. You know every individual has to pay income tax on his income if it exceeds certain minimum limit. But the income tax liability is not settled immediately when one earns his income. The income tax authority settles it some time later, which is technically called assessment year. Then how does he record this liability? As per historical cost base it is to be recorded at an amount expected to be paid to discharge the liability.\\nCompanies usually apply historical cost method in case of long-term assets like machinery, furniture, licenses etc.',\n",
       "  'Valuation Principles of Current Cost: \\nTake that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 at . As per historical cost base he has to record it at  i.e. the acquisition price.

As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000.\\nCurrent cost gives an alternative measurement base. Assets are carried out at the amount of cash or cash equivalent that would have to be paid if the same or an equivalent asset was acquired currently. Liabilities are carried at the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents that would be required to settle the obligation currently.\\nSo as per current cost base, the machine value is  while the value of bank loan is ₹ 5,05,000.',\n",
       "  'Valuation Principles of Realisable Value: \\nSuppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently.

Haphazard disposal may yield something less. Liabilities are carried at their settlement values; i.e. the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents expressed to be paid to satisfy the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nSo, the machine should be recorded at ₹  the realisable value in an orderly sale while the bank loan should be recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 the settlement value in the normal course of business.\\nRealisable value concept is commonly applied in case of inventories. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.',\n",
       "  \"Valuation Principles of Present Value: \\nSuppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference. Now think the machine purchased by Mr. X can work for another 10 years and is supposed to generate cash @ ₹ 1,00,000 p.a. Also take that bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 taken by Mr.  is to be repaid as on 31.12.2028. Annual interest is .\\nAs per present value, an asset is carried at the present discounted value of the future net cash inflows that the item is expected to generate in the normal course of business. Liabilities are carried at the present discounted value of future net cash outflows that are expected to be required to settle the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nThe concept of Present Value is common in case of accounting for investments and loans.\\nThe term 'discount', 'cash inflow' and 'cash outflow' need a little elaboration. ₹ 100 in hand as on 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 in hand as on 31.12.2022. There is a time gap of one year. If Mr. X had ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 he could use it at that time. If he received it only on 31.12.2022, he had to sacrifice his use for a year. The value of this sacrifice is called 'time value of money'. Mr.  would sacrifice i.e. he would agree to take money on 31.12.2022 if he had been compensated for the sacrifice. So a rational man will never exchange ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 with ₹ 100 to be received on 31.12.2022. Then ₹ 100 of 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 of 31.12.2022. To make the money receivable at a future date equal with the money of the present date it is to be devalued. Such devaluation is called discounting of future money.\\nPerhaps you know the compound interest rule: \\n Amount\\n Principal\\n interest \\n Time\\nThis equation gives the relationship between present money, principal and the future money amount. If  and  are given, to find out , the equation is to be changed slightly.\\n\\nUsing the equation one can find out the present value if he knows the values of  and .\\nSuppose , now what is the present value of  to be received as on 31.12.2022 (Take 1.1.2022 as the time of reference).\\n\\nSimilarly,\\nOn 31.12.2023, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹69,444.\\nOn 31.12.2024, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹57,870.\\nOn 31.12.2025, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹48,225.\\nOn 31.12.2026, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹40,188.\\nOn 31.12.2027, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹33,490.\\nOn 31.12.2028, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹27,908.\\nOn 31.12.2029, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹23,257.\\nOn 31.12.2030, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹19,381.\\nOn 31.12.2031, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹16,150. \\u200b\\nTotal of all these present values is ₹ 4,19,246. Since the machine purchased by Mr. X will produce cash equivalent to ₹ 4,19,246 in terms of present value, it is to be valued at such amount as per present value measurement basis.\\nHere, Mr.  will receive  at different points of time-these are cash inflows. In the other example, he has to pay interest and principal of bank loan-these are cash outflows.\\nPerhaps you also know the annuity rule:\\nPresent value of an Annuity or Re. A for  periods is\\nA = Annuity\\n interest\\n time , n.\\n\\nApplying this rule one can derive the present value of ₹ 1,00,000 for 10 years @ 20% p.a.\\n\\nSimilarly, the present value of bank loan is\\n\\n\\nThus, we get the four measurements as on 1.1.2022:\\nThe machine asset has a historical cost of ₹7,00,000, a current cost of ₹25,00,000, a realisable value of ₹20,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,19,246. The bank loan liability has a historical cost of ₹5,00,000, a current cost of ₹5,05,000, a realisable value of ₹5,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,70,094. \\u200b\\u200b\\nThe accounting system which we shall discuss in the remaining chapters is also called historical cost accounting. However, this need not mean that one shall follow only historical cost basis of accounting. In the later stages of the CA course, we shall see that the accounting system uses all types of measurement bases although under the traditional system most of the transactions and events are measured in terms of historical cost.\",\n",
       "  'MEASUREMENT AND VALUATION\\nValue relates to the benefits to be derived from objects, abilities or ideas. To the economist, value is the utility (i.e.; satisfaction) of an economic resource to the person contemplating or enjoying its use. In accounting, to mean value of an object, abilities or ideas, a monetary surrogate is used. That is to say, value is measured in terms of money. Suppose, an individual purchased a car paying . Its value lies in the satisfaction to be derived by that individual using the car in future. Economists often use ordinal scale to indicate the level of satisfaction. But accountants use only cardinal scales. If the value of car is taken as ₹ 2,50,000 it is only one type of value called acquisition cost or historical cost. So value is indicated by measurement. In accounting the value is always measured in terms of money.',\n",
       "  'ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\\nEarlier in this unit we have learned how to measure a transaction, which had already taken place and for which either some value/money has been paid or some valuation principles are to be adopted for their measurement. But there are certain items, which have not occurred therefore cannot be measured using valuation principles still they are necessary to record in the books of account, for example, provision for doubtful debts. For such items, we need some value. In such a situation reasonable estimates based on the existing situation and past experiences are made.\\nThe measurement of certain assets and liabilities is based on estimates of uncertain future events. As a result of the uncertainties inherent in business activities, many financial statement items cannot be measured with precision but can only be estimated. Therefore, the management makes various estimates and assumptions of assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses as on the date of preparation of financial statements. Such estimates are made in connection with the computation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses as well as, accruals, provisions and employee benefit obligations. Also estimates may be required in determining the bad debts, useful life and residual value of an item of plant and machinery and inventory obsolescence. The process of estimation involves judgements based on the latest information available.\\nAn estimate may require revision if changes occur regarding circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of new information, more experience or subsequent developments. Change in accounting estimate means difference arises between certain parameters estimated earlier and re-estimated during the current period or actual result achieved during the current period.\\nFew examples of situations wherein accounting estimates are needed can be given as follows:\\nA company incurs expenditure of  on development of patent. Now the company has to estimate that for how many years the patent would benefit the company. This estimation should be based on the latest information and logical judgement.\\nA company dealing in long-term construction contracts, uses percentage of completion method for recognizing the revenue at the end of the accounting year. Under this method the company has to make adequate provisions for unseen contingencies, which can take place while executing the remaining portion of the contract. Since provisioning for unseen contingencies requires estimation, there may be excess or short provisioning, which is to be adjusted in the period when it is recognised.\\nA company has to provide for taxes which is also based on estimation as there can be some interpretational differences on account of which tax authorities may either accept the expenditure or refuse it. This will ultimately lead to different tax liability.\\nCompany XY Ltd purchases a machine for ₹ 10 lac in 2021. The procurement head suggested that the machine is expected to offer benefits up to next 10 years. After 3 years of its use, the machine has become obsolete as new technologies are now available providing better productivity than the existing machine. Hence, it is now expected that the machine can only offer benefits for further 3 years. This is a change in estimate in the useful life of the machine.'])"

       "['MEANING OF MEASUREMENT\\nMeasurement is vital aspect of accounting. Primarily transactions and events are measured in terms of money. Any measurement discipline deals with three basic elements of measurement viz., identification of objects and events to be measured, selection of standard or scale to be used, and evaluation of dimension of measurement standards or scale.\\nProf. R. J. Chambers defined \\'measurement\\' as \"assignment of numbers to objects and events according to rules specifying the property to be measured, the scale to be used and the dimension of the unit\". (R.J. Chambers, Accounting Evaluation and Economic Behaviour, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 1966, P.10).\\nKohler defined measurement as the assignment of a system of ordinal or cardinal numbers to the results of a scheme of inquiry or apparatus of observations in accordance with logical or mathematical rules - [A Dictionary of Accountant].\\nOrdinal numbers, or ordinals, are numbers used to denote the position in an ordered sequence: first, second, third, fourth, etc., whereas a cardinal number says \\'how many there are\\': one, two, three, four, etc.\\nChambers\\' definition has been widely used to judge how far accounting can be treated as a measurement discipline.\\nAccording to this definition, the three elements of measurement are:\\nIdentification of objects and events to be measured;\\nSelection of standard or scale to be used;\\nEvaluation of dimension of measurement standard or scale.',\n",
       " \"OBJECTS OR EVENTS TO BE MEASURED\\nWe have earlier defined Accounting as the process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decisions by the users of the information. So accounting essentially includes measurement of 'information'.\\nDecision makers need past, present and future information. For external users, generally the past information is communicated.\\nThere is no uniform set of events and transactions in accounting which are required for decision making. For example, in cash management, various cash receipts and expenses are the necessary objects and events. Obviously, the decision makers need past cash receipts and expenses data along with projected receipts and expenses. For giving loan to a business one needs information regarding the repayment ability (popularly called debt servicing) of principal and interest. This also includes past information, current state of affairs as well as future projections. It may be mentioned that past and present objects and events can be measured with some degree of accuracy but future events and objects are only predicted, not measured. Prediction is an essential part of accounting information. Decision makers have to take decisions about the unseen future for which they need suitable information.\",\n",
       " 'STANDARD OR SCALE OF MEASUREMENT\\nIn accounting, money is the scale of measurement (see money measurement concept), although now-a- days quantitative information is also communicated along with monetary information.\\nMoney as a measurement scale has no universal denomination. It takes the shape of currency ruling in a country. For example, in India the scale of measurement is Rupee, in the U.K. Pound Sterling (  ), in Germany Deutschmark (DM), in the United States Dollar ($) and so on. Also there is no constant exchange relationship among the currencies.\\nIf one businessman in India took loan  from a businessman of the U.S.A., he would enter the transaction in his books in terms of ₹ Suppose at the time of loan agreement exchange rate was US . Then loan amounted to ₹ . Afterwards the exchange rate has been changed to . At the changed exchange rate the loan amount becomes₹ . So money as a unit of measurement lacks universal applicability across the boundary of a country unless a common currency is in vogue. Since the rate of exchange fluctuates between two currencies over the time, money as a measurement scale also becomes volatile.',\n",
       " 'DIMENSION OF MEASUREMENT SCALE\\nAn ideal measurement scale should be stable over time. For example, if one buys . cabbage today, the quantity he receives will be the same if he will buy . cabbage one year later. Similarly, length of 1 metre cloth will not change if it is bought a few days later. That is to say a measurement scale should be stable in dimension. Money as a scale of measurement is not stable. There occurs continuous change in the input output prices. The same quantity of money may not have the ability to buy same quantity of identical goods at different dates. Thus information of one year measured in money terms may not be comparable with that of another year. Suppose production and sales of a company in two different years are as follows:\\nIn Year 1, 5,000 pieces were valued at ₹5,00,000, while in Year 2, 4,500 pieces were valued at ₹5,40,000\\nLooking at the monetary figures one may be glad for  sales growth. In fact there was  production and sales decline. The growth envisaged through monetary figures is only due to price change. Let us suppose further that the cost of production for the above mentioned two years is as follows:\\nIn Year 1, the quantity was 5,000 pieces valued at ₹4,00,000; in Year 2, it was 4,500 pieces valued at ₹4,50,000.\\nTake Gross profit  Sales - Cost of Production. Then in the first year profit was ₹ 1,00,000 while in the second year the profit was ₹ 90,000 . There was  decline in gross profit.\\nSo, money as a unit of measurement is not stable in the dimension.\\nThus, Accounting measures information mostly in money terms which is not a stable scale having universal applicability and also not stable in dimension for comparison over the time. So it is not an exact measurement discipline.',\n",
       " \"ACCOUNTING AS A MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE\\nHow do you measure a transaction or an event? Unless the measurement base is settled we cannot progress to the record keeping function of book-keeping. It has been explained that accounting is meant for generating information suitable for users' judgments and decisions. But generation of such information is preceded by recording, classifying and summarising data. By that process it measures performance of the business entity by way of profit or loss and shows its financial position. Thus, measurement is an important part of accounting discipline. But a set of theorems governs the whole measurement sub- system. These theorems should be carefully understood to know how the cogs of the 'accounting-wheel' work. Now-a-days accounting profession earmarked three theorems namely going concern, consistency and accrual as fundamental accounting assumptions, i.e., these assumptions are taken for granted. Also while measuring, classifying, summarising and also presenting, various policies are adopted. Recording, classifying summarising and communication of information are also important part of accounting, which do not fall within the purview of measurement discipline. Therefore, we cannot simply say that accounting is a measurement discipline.\\nBut in accounting money is the unit of measurement. So, let us take one thing for granted that all transactions and events are to be recorded in terms of money only. Quantitative information is also required in many cases but such information is only supplementary to monetary information.\",\n",
       " 'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are:\\nHistorical Cost;\\nCurrent Cost:\\nRealizable Value;\\nPresent Value.\\nLet us discuss these principles in detail.\\nValuation Principles of Historical Cost: \\nIt means acquisition price. For example, the businessman paid  to purchase the machine and spend  on its installation, its acquisition price including installation charges is . The historical cost of machine would be ₹8,00,000.\\nAccording to this base, assets are recorded at an amount of cash or cash equivalent paid at the time of acquisition. Liabilities are recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business.\\nValuation Principles of Current Cost: \\nTake that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 at . As per historical cost base he has to record it at  i.e. the acquisition price. As on 1.1.2022, Mr. X found that it would cost ₹  to purchase that machine. Take also that Mr. X took loan from a bank as on 1.1.2011 ₹ 5,00,000 @ 18% p.a. repayable at the end of 15 th year together with interest. As on 1.1.2022 the bank announces  prepayment penalty on the loan amount if it is paid within 15 days starting from that day. As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000.\\nValuation Principles of Realisable Value: \\nSuppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently. Take also that Mr. X found that he had no money to pay off the bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 currently.\\nValuation Principles of Present Value: \\nSuppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference. Now think the machine purchased by Mr. X can work for another 10 years and is supposed to generate cash @ ₹ 1,00,000 p.a. Also take that bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 taken by Mr.  is to be repaid as on 31.12.2028. Annual interest is .',\n",
       " 'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are:\\nHistorical Cost;\\nCurrent Cost:\\nRealizable Value;\\nPresent Value.\\nLet us discuss these principles in detail.',\n",

Liabilities are recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business.\\nWhen a businessman, takes ₹ 5,00,000 loan from a bank @ 10% interest p.a., it is to be recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. Here the obligation is the repayment of loan as well as payment of interest at an agreed rate i.e. . Proceeds received are  - it is historical cost of the transactions.\\nTake another case regarding payment of income tax liability. You know every individual has to pay income tax on his income if it exceeds certain minimum limit. But the income tax liability is not settled immediately when one earns his income. The income tax authority settles it some time later, which is technically called assessment year. Then how does he record this liability? As per historical cost base it is to be recorded at an amount expected to be paid to discharge the liability.\\nCompanies usually apply historical cost method in case of long-term assets like machinery, furniture, licenses etc.',\n",
       " 'Valuation Principles of Current Cost: \\nTake that Mr. X purchased a machine on 1st January, 2011 at . As per historical cost base he has to record it at  i.e. the acquisition price.

As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000.\\nCurrent cost gives an alternative measurement base. Assets are carried out at the amount of cash or cash equivalent that would have to be paid if the same or an equivalent asset was acquired currently. Liabilities are carried at the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents that would be required to settle the obligation currently.\\nSo as per current cost base, the machine value is  while the value of bank loan is ₹ 5,05,000.',\n",
       " 'Valuation Principles of Realisable Value: \\nSuppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently.

Haphazard disposal may yield something less. Liabilities are carried at their settlement values; i.e. the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents expressed to be paid to satisfy the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nSo, the machine should be recorded at ₹  the realisable value in an orderly sale while the bank loan should be recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 the settlement value in the normal course of business.\\nRealisable value concept is commonly applied in case of inventories. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.',\n",
       " \"Valuation Principles of Present Value: \\nSuppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference.

Annual interest is .\\nAs per present value, an asset is carried at the present discounted value of the future net cash inflows that the item is expected to generate in the normal course of business. Liabilities are carried at the present discounted value of future net cash outflows that are expected to be required to settle the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nThe concept of Present Value is common in case of accounting for investments and loans.\\nThe term 'discount', 'cash inflow' and 'cash outflow' need a little elaboration. ₹ 100 in hand as on 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 in hand as on 31.12.2022. There is a time gap of one year. If Mr. X had ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 he could use it at that time. If he received it only on 31.12.2022, he had to sacrifice his use for a year. The value of this sacrifice is called 'time value of money'. Mr.  would sacrifice i.e. he would agree to take money on 31.12.2022 if he had been compensated for the sacrifice. So a rational man will never exchange ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 with ₹ 100 to be received on 31.12.2022. Then ₹ 100 of 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 of 31.12.2022. To make the money receivable at a future date equal with the money of the present date it is to be devalued. Such devaluation is called discounting of future money.\\nPerhaps you know the compound interest rule: \\n Amount\\n Principal\\n interest \\n Time\\nThis equation gives the relationship between present money, principal and the future money amount. If  and  are given, to find out , the equation is to be changed slightly.\\n\\nUsing the equation one can find out the present value if he knows the values of  and .\\nSuppose , now what is the present value of  to be received as on 31.12.2022 (Take 1.1.2022 as the time of reference).\\n\\nSimilarly,\\nOn 31.12.2023, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹69,444.\\nOn 31.12.2024, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹57,870.\\nOn 31.12.2025, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹48,225.\\nOn 31.12.2026, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹40,188.\\nOn 31.12.2027, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹33,490.\\nOn 31.12.2028, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹27,908.\\nOn 31.12.2029, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹23,257.\\nOn 31.12.2030, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹19,381.\\nOn 31.12.2031, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹16,150. \\u200b\\nTotal of all these present values is ₹ 4,19,246. Since the machine purchased by Mr. X will produce cash equivalent to ₹ 4,19,246 in terms of present value, it is to be valued at such amount as per present value measurement basis.\\nHere, Mr.  will receive  at different points of time-these are cash inflows. In the other example, he has to pay interest and principal of bank loan-these are cash outflows.\\nPerhaps you also know the annuity rule:\\nPresent value of an Annuity or Re. A for  periods is\\nA = Annuity\\n interest\\n time , n.\\n\\nApplying this rule one can derive the present value of ₹ 1,00,000 for 10 years @ 20% p.a.\\n\\nSimilarly, the present value of bank loan is\\n\\n\\nThus, we get the four measurements as on 1.1.2022:\\nThe machine asset has a historical cost of ₹7,00,000, a current cost of ₹25,00,000, a realisable value of ₹20,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,19,246. The bank loan liability has a historical cost of ₹5,00,000, a current cost of ₹5,05,000, a realisable value of ₹5,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,70,094. \\u200b\\u200b\\nThe accounting system which we shall discuss in the remaining chapters is also called historical cost accounting.

       " 'MEASUREMENT AND VALUATION\\nValue relates to the benefits to be derived from objects, abilities or ideas. To the economist, value is the utility (i.e.; satisfaction) of an economic resource to the person contemplating or enjoying its use. In accounting, to mean value of an object, abilities or ideas, a monetary surrogate is used. That is to say, value is measured in terms of money. Suppose, an individual purchased a car paying . Its value lies in the satisfaction to be derived by that individual using the car in future. Economists often use ordinal scale to indicate the level of satisfaction. But accountants use only cardinal scales. If the value of car is taken as ₹ 2,50,000 it is only one type of value called acquisition cost or historical cost. So value is indicated by measurement. In accounting the value is always measured in terms of money.',\n",
       " 'ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\\nEarlier in this unit we have learned how to measure a transaction, which had already taken place and for which either some value/money has been paid or some valuation principles are to be adopted for their measurement. But there are certain items, which have not occurred therefore cannot be measured using valuation principles still they are necessary to record in the books of account, for example, provision for doubtful debts. For such items, we need some value. In such a situation reasonable estimates based on the existing situation and past experiences are made.\\nThe measurement of certain assets and liabilities is based on estimates of uncertain future events. As a result of the uncertainties inherent in business activities, many financial statement items cannot be measured with precision but can only be estimated. Therefore, the management makes various estimates and assumptions of assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses as on the date of preparation of financial statements. Such estimates are made in connection with the computation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses as well as, accruals, provisions and employee benefit obligations. Also estimates may be required in determining the bad debts, useful life and residual value of an item of plant and machinery and inventory obsolescence. The process of estimation involves judgements based on the latest information available.\\nAn estimate may require revision if changes occur regarding circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of new information, more experience or subsequent developments. Change in accounting estimate means difference arises between certain parameters estimated earlier and re-estimated during the current period or actual result achieved during the current period.\\nFew examples of situations wherein accounting estimates are needed can be given as follows:\\nA company incurs expenditure of  on development of patent. Now the company has to estimate that for how many years the patent would benefit the company. This estimation should be based on the latest information and logical judgement.\\nA company dealing in long-term construction contracts, uses percentage of completion method for recognizing the revenue at the end of the accounting year. Under this method the company has to make adequate provisions for unseen contingencies, which can take place while executing the remaining portion of the contract. Since provisioning for unseen contingencies requires estimation, there may be excess or short provisioning, which is to be adjusted in the period when it is recognised.\\nA company has to provide for taxes which is also based on estimation as there can be some interpretational differences on account of which tax authorities may either accept the expenditure or refuse it. This will ultimately lead to different tax liability.\\nCompany XY Ltd purchases a machine for ₹ 10 lac in 2021. The procurement head suggested that the machine is expected to offer benefits up to next 10 years. After 3 years of its use, the machine has become obsolete as new technologies are now available providing better productivity than the existing machine. Hence, it is now expected that the machine can only offer benefits for further 3 years. This is a change in estimate in the useful life of the machine.']"

       "['MEANING OF MEASUREMENT\\nMeasurement is vital aspect of accounting. Primarily transactions and events are measured in terms of money. Any measurement discipline deals with three basic elements of measurement viz., identification of objects and events to be measured, selection of standard or scale to be used, and evaluation of dimension of measurement standards or scale.\\nProf. R. J. Chambers defined \\'measurement\\' as \"assignment of numbers to objects and events according to rules specifying the property to be measured, the scale to be used and the dimension of the unit\". (R.J. Chambers, Accounting Evaluation and Economic Behaviour, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 1966, P.10).\\nKohler defined measurement as the assignment of a system of ordinal or cardinal numbers to the results of a scheme of inquiry or apparatus of observations in accordance with logical or mathematical rules - [A Dictionary of Accountant].\\nOrdinal numbers, or ordinals, are numbers used to denote the position in an ordered sequence: first, second, third, fourth, etc., whereas a cardinal number says \\'how many there are\\': one, two, three, four, etc.\\nChambers\\' definition has been widely used to judge how far accounting can be treated as a measurement discipline.\\nAccording to this definition, the three elements of measurement are:\\nIdentification of objects and events to be measured;\\nSelection of standard or scale to be used;\\nEvaluation of dimension of measurement standard or scale.',\n",
       " \"OBJECTS OR EVENTS TO BE MEASURED\\nWe have earlier defined Accounting as the process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decisions by the users of the information. So accounting essentially includes measurement of 'information'.\\nDecision makers need past, present and future information. For external users, generally the past information is communicated.\\nThere is no uniform set of events and transactions in accounting which are required for decision making. For example, in cash management, various cash receipts and expenses are the necessary objects and events. Obviously, the decision makers need past cash receipts and expenses data along with projected receipts and expenses. For giving loan to a business one needs information regarding the repayment ability (popularly called debt servicing) of principal and interest. This also includes past information, current state of affairs as well as future projections. It may be mentioned that past and present objects and events can be measured with some degree of accuracy but future events and objects are only predicted, not measured. Prediction is an essential part of accounting information. Decision makers have to take decisions about the unseen future for which they need suitable information.\",\n",
       " 'STANDARD OR SCALE OF MEASUREMENT\\nIn accounting, money is the scale of measurement (see money measurement concept), although now-a- days quantitative information is also communicated along with monetary information.\\nMoney as a measurement scale has no universal denomination. It takes the shape of currency ruling in a country. For example, in India the scale of measurement is Rupee, in the U.K. Pound Sterling (  ), in Germany Deutschmark (DM), in the United States Dollar ($) and so on. Also there is no constant exchange relationship among the currencies.\\nIf one businessman in India took loan  from a businessman of the U.S.A., he would enter the transaction in his books in terms of ₹ Suppose at the time of loan agreement exchange rate was US . Then loan amounted to ₹ . Afterwards the exchange rate has been changed to . At the changed exchange rate the loan amount becomes₹ . So money as a unit of measurement lacks universal applicability across the boundary of a country unless a common currency is in vogue. Since the rate of exchange fluctuates between two currencies over the time, money as a measurement scale also becomes volatile.',\n",
       " 'DIMENSION OF MEASUREMENT SCALE\\nAn ideal measurement scale should be stable over time. For example, if one buys . cabbage today, the quantity he receives will be the same if he will buy . cabbage one year later. Similarly, length of 1 metre cloth will not change if it is bought a few days later. That is to say a measurement scale should be stable in dimension. Money as a scale of measurement is not stable. There occurs continuous change in the input output prices. The same quantity of money may not have the ability to buy same quantity of identical goods at different dates. Thus information of one year measured in money terms may not be comparable with that of another year. Suppose production and sales of a company in two different years are as follows:\\nIn Year 1, 5,000 pieces were valued at ₹5,00,000, while in Year 2, 4,500 pieces were valued at ₹5,40,000\\nLooking at the monetary figures one may be glad for  sales growth. In fact there was  production and sales decline. The growth envisaged through monetary figures is only due to price change. Let us suppose further that the cost of production for the above mentioned two years is as follows:\\nIn Year 1, the quantity was 5,000 pieces valued at ₹4,00,000; in Year 2, it was 4,500 pieces valued at ₹4,50,000.\\nTake Gross profit  Sales - Cost of Production. Then in the first year profit was ₹ 1,00,000 while in the second year the profit was ₹ 90,000 . There was  decline in gross profit.\\nSo, money as a unit of measurement is not stable in the dimension.\\nThus, Accounting measures information mostly in money terms which is not a stable scale having universal applicability and also not stable in dimension for comparison over the time. So it is not an exact measurement discipline.',\n",
       " \"ACCOUNTING AS A MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE\\nHow do you measure a transaction or an event? Unless the measurement base is settled we cannot progress to the record keeping function of book-keeping. It has been explained that accounting is meant for generating information suitable for users' judgments and decisions. But generation of such information is preceded by recording, classifying and summarising data. By that process it measures performance of the business entity by way of profit or loss and shows its financial position. Thus, measurement is an important part of accounting discipline. But a set of theorems governs the whole measurement sub- system. These theorems should be carefully understood to know how the cogs of the 'accounting-wheel' work. Now-a-days accounting profession earmarked three theorems namely going concern, consistency and accrual as fundamental accounting assumptions, i.e., these assumptions are taken for granted. Also while measuring, classifying, summarising and also presenting, various policies are adopted. Recording, classifying summarising and communication of information are also important part of accounting, which do not fall within the purview of measurement discipline. Therefore, we cannot simply say that accounting is a measurement discipline.\\nBut in accounting money is the unit of measurement. So, let us take one thing for granted that all transactions and events are to be recorded in terms of money only. Quantitative information is also required in many cases but such information is only supplementary to monetary information.\",\n",
       " 'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are:\\nHistorical Cost;\\nCurrent Cost:\\nRealizable Value;\\nPresent Value.\\nLet us discuss these principles in detail.\\nValuation Principles of Historical Cost: \\nIt means acquisition price. For example, the businessman paid  to purchase the machine and spend  on its installation, its acquisition price including installation charges is . The historical cost of machine would be ₹8,00,000.\\nAccording to this base, assets are recorded at an amount of cash or cash equivalent paid at the time of acquisition.

       " 'VALUATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are four generally accepted measurement bases or valuation principles. These are:\\nHistorical Cost;\\nCurrent Cost:\\nRealizable Value;\\nPresent Value.\\nLet us discuss these principles in detail.',\n",
       " 'Valuation Principles of Historical Cost: \\nIt means acquisition price. For example, the businessman paid  to purchase the machine and spend  on its installation, its acquisition price including installation charges is . The historical cost of machine would be ₹8,00,000.\\nAccording to this base, assets are recorded at an amount of cash or cash equivalent paid at the time of acquisition. Liabilities are recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. In some circumstances a liability is recorded at the amount of cash or cash equivalent expected to be paid to satisfy it in the normal course of business.\\nWhen a businessman, takes ₹ 5,00,000 loan from a bank @ 10% interest p.a., it is to be recorded at the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation. Here the obligation is the repayment of loan as well as payment of interest at an agreed rate i.e. . Proceeds received are  - it is historical cost of the transactions.\\nTake another case regarding payment of income tax liability. You know every individual has to pay income tax on his income if it exceeds certain minimum limit. But the income tax liability is not settled immediately when one earns his income. The income tax authority settles it some time later, which is technically called assessment year. Then how does he record this liability? As per historical cost base it is to be recorded at an amount expected to be paid to discharge the liability.\\nCompanies usually apply historical cost method in case of long-term assets like machinery, furniture, licenses etc.',\n",

As per historical cost the liability is recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 at the amount or proceeds received in exchange for obligation and asset is recorded at ₹ 7,00,000.\\nCurrent cost gives an alternative measurement base. Assets are carried out at the amount of cash or cash equivalent that would have to be paid if the same or an equivalent asset was acquired currently. Liabilities are carried at the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents that would be required to settle the obligation currently.\\nSo as per current cost base, the machine value is  while the value of bank loan is ₹ 5,05,000.',\n",
       " 'Valuation Principles of Realisable Value: \\nSuppose Mr. X found that he can get ₹ 20,00,000 if he would sell the machine purchased, on 1.1.2011 paying  and which would cost  in case he would buy it currently. Take also that Mr. X found that he had no money to pay off the bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 currently.\\nAs per realisable value, assets are carried at the amount of cash or cash equivalents that could currently be obtained by selling the assets in an orderly disposal. Haphazard disposal may yield something less. Liabilities are carried at their settlement values; i.e. the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents expressed to be paid to satisfy the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nSo, the machine should be recorded at ₹  the realisable value in an orderly sale while the bank loan should be recorded at ₹ 5,00,000 the settlement value in the normal course of business.\\nRealisable value concept is commonly applied in case of inventories. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.',\n",
       " \"Valuation Principles of Present Value: \\nSuppose we are talking as on 1.1.2022 - take it as time for reference. Now think the machine purchased by Mr. X can work for another 10 years and is supposed to generate cash @ ₹ 1,00,000 p.a. Also take that bank loan of ₹ 5,00,000 taken by Mr.  is to be repaid as on 31.12.2028. Annual interest is .\\nAs per present value, an asset is carried at the present discounted value of the future net cash inflows that the item is expected to generate in the normal course of business. Liabilities are carried at the present discounted value of future net cash outflows that are expected to be required to settle the liabilities in the normal course of business.\\nThe concept of Present Value is common in case of accounting for investments and loans.\\nThe term 'discount', 'cash inflow' and 'cash outflow' need a little elaboration. ₹ 100 in hand as on 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 in hand as on 31.12.2022. There is a time gap of one year. If Mr. X had ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 he could use it at that time. If he received it only on 31.12.2022, he had to sacrifice his use for a year. The value of this sacrifice is called 'time value of money'. Mr.  would sacrifice i.e. he would agree to take money on 31.12.2022 if he had been compensated for the sacrifice. So a rational man will never exchange ₹ 100 as on 1.1.2022 with ₹ 100 to be received on 31.12.2022. Then ₹ 100 of 1.1.2022 is not equivalent to ₹ 100 of 31.12.2022. To make the money receivable at a future date equal with the money of the present date it is to be devalued. Such devaluation is called discounting of future money.\\nPerhaps you know the compound interest rule: \\n Amount\\n Principal\\n interest \\n Time\\nThis equation gives the relationship between present money, principal and the future money amount. If  and  are given, to find out , the equation is to be changed slightly.\\n\\nUsing the equation one can find out the present value if he knows the values of  and .\\nSuppose , now what is the present value of  to be received as on 31.12.2022 (Take 1.1.2022 as the time of reference).\\n\\nSimilarly,\\nOn 31.12.2023, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹69,444.\\nOn 31.12.2024, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹57,870.\\nOn 31.12.2025, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹48,225.\\nOn 31.12.2026, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹40,188.\\nOn 31.12.2027, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹33,490.\\nOn 31.12.2028, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹27,908.\\nOn 31.12.2029, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹23,257.\\nOn 31.12.2030, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹19,381.\\nOn 31.12.2031, the money value of ₹1,00,000 will have a present value of ₹16,150. \\u200b\\nTotal of all these present values is ₹ 4,19,246. Since the machine purchased by Mr. X will produce cash equivalent to ₹ 4,19,246 in terms of present value, it is to be valued at such amount as per present value measurement basis.\\nHere, Mr.  will receive  at different points of time-these are cash inflows. In the other example, he has to pay interest and principal of bank loan-these are cash outflows.\\nPerhaps you also know the annuity rule:\\nPresent value of an Annuity or Re. A for  periods is\\nA = Annuity\\n interest\\n time , n.\\n\\nApplying this rule one can derive the present value of ₹ 1,00,000 for 10 years @ 20% p.a.\\n\\nSimilarly, the present value of bank loan is\\n\\n\\nThus, we get the four measurements as on 1.1.2022:\\nThe machine asset has a historical cost of ₹7,00,000, a current cost of ₹25,00,000, a realisable value of ₹20,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,19,246. The bank loan liability has a historical cost of ₹5,00,000, a current cost of ₹5,05,000, a realisable value of ₹5,00,000, and a present value of ₹4,70,094. \\u200b\\u200b\\nThe accounting system which we shall discuss in the remaining chapters is also called historical cost accounting. However, this need not mean that one shall follow only historical cost basis of accounting. In the later stages of the CA course, we shall see that the accounting system uses all types of measurement bases although under the traditional system most of the transactions and events are measured in terms of historical cost.\",\n",
       " 'MEASUREMENT AND VALUATION\\nValue relates to the benefits to be derived from objects, abilities or ideas. To the economist, value is the utility (i.e.; satisfaction) of an economic resource to the person contemplating or enjoying its use. In accounting, to mean value of an object, abilities or ideas, a monetary surrogate is used. That is to say, value is measured in terms of money. Suppose, an individual purchased a car paying . Its value lies in the satisfaction to be derived by that individual using the car in future. Economists often use ordinal scale to indicate the level of satisfaction. But accountants use only cardinal scales. If the value of car is taken as ₹ 2,50,000 it is only one type of value called acquisition cost or historical cost. So value is indicated by measurement. In accounting the value is always measured in terms of money.',\n",
       " 'ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\\nEarlier in this unit we have learned how to measure a transaction, which had already taken place and for which either some value/money has been paid or some valuation principles are to be adopted for their measurement. But there are certain items, which have not occurred therefore cannot be measured using valuation principles still they are necessary to record in the books of account, for example, provision for doubtful debts. For such items, we need some value. In such a situation reasonable estimates based on the existing situation and past experiences are made.\\nThe measurement of certain assets and liabilities is based on estimates of uncertain future events. As a result of the uncertainties inherent in business activities, many financial statement items cannot be measured with precision but can only be estimated. Therefore, the management makes various estimates and assumptions of assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses as on the date of preparation of financial statements. Such estimates are made in connection with the computation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses as well as, accruals, provisions and employee benefit obligations. Also estimates may be required in determining the bad debts, useful life and residual value of an item of plant and machinery and inventory obsolescence. The process of estimation involves judgements based on the latest information available.\\nAn estimate may require revision if changes occur regarding circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of new information, more experience or subsequent developments. Change in accounting estimate means difference arises between certain parameters estimated earlier and re-estimated during the current period or actual result achieved during the current period.\\nFew examples of situations wherein accounting estimates are needed can be given as follows:\\nA company incurs expenditure of  on development of patent. Now the company has to estimate that for how many years the patent would benefit the company. This estimation should be based on the latest information and logical judgement.\\nA company dealing in long-term construction contracts, uses percentage of completion method for recognizing the revenue at the end of the accounting year. Under this method the company has to make adequate provisions for unseen contingencies, which can take place while executing the remaining portion of the contract. Since provisioning for unseen contingencies requires estimation, there may be excess or short provisioning, which is to be adjusted in the period when it is recognised.\\nA company has to provide for taxes which is also based on estimation as there can be some interpretational differences on account of which tax authorities may either accept the expenditure or refuse it. This will ultimately lead to different tax liability.\\nCompany XY Ltd purchases a machine for ₹ 10 lac in 2021. The procurement head suggested that the machine is expected to offer benefits up to next 10 years. After 3 years of its use, the machine has become obsolete as new technologies are now available providing better productivity than the existing machine. Hence, it is now expected that the machine can only offer benefits for further 3 years. This is a change in estimate in the useful life of the machine.']"

Any measurement discipline deals with three basic elements of measurement viz., identification of objects and events to be measured, selection of standard or scale to be used, and evaluation of dimension of measurement standards or scale.\\nProf. R. J. Chambers defined \\'measurement\\' as \"assignment of numbers to objects and events according to rules specifying the property to be measured, the scale to be used and the dimension of the unit\". (R.J. Chambers, Accounting Evaluation and Economic Behaviour, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 1966, P.10).\\nKohler defined measurement as the assignment of a system of ordinal or cardinal numbers to the results of a scheme of inquiry or apparatus of observations in accordance with logical or mathematical rules - [A Dictionary of Accountant].\\nOrdinal numbers, or ordinals, are numbers used to denote the position in an ordered sequence: first, second, third, fourth, etc., whereas a cardinal number says \\'how many there are\\': one, two, three, four, etc.\\nChambers\\' definition has been widely used to judge how far accounting can be treated as a measurement discipline.\\nAccording to this definition, the three elements of measurement are:\\nIdentification of objects and events to be measured;\\nSelection of standard or scale to be used;\\nEvaluation of dimension of measurement standard or scale.',\n",
